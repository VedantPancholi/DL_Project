Review
nothing to like as such except the package
worst organisation of the world their manager cheated with me they took my zomato payroll job by saying we will onroll you within 3 months but they ended my contract without reason after 9 months worst culture at that time zero job security no life and job insurance they will fire you without reason only for their profit no respect for hardworking people if you want to pursue dream job then please do not join swiggy
there is nothing to like about working with this organization all dislikes
everything there is nothing to like mark my words if you are going to switch your job for this organization this will be biggest mistake in your entire career
flexible timings if you love visiting restaurants and understand their management and growth then it is the best
no job security your efforts will be marked as territory team efforts people who comes through the referral are favourite of the seniors no accounts are given and targets are at their peak from day1 dineout is no more a growth department specially under dhruv kapoor and sunny you will be spoiled and your achievements will be their achievements and you will be out of system
hybrid work policy
i cant even think of where to start theres no accountability no planning and no set processes in place everything is ad hoc and chaotic worklife balance is nonexistentyoure expected to take work calls even on weekends youre often asked to make ppts late into the night over the weekend because some leader decided to meet with the partner at the last minute whats astonishing is the lack of an sop or framework for promotions halfyearly targets are given in july because no one bothered to share the kpis on time this happens because ratings and promotions are entirely subjective and perceptiondriven theres no bell curve and no performance scores are published to help you benchmark yourself against your peers the hr team is weak and heavily influenced by business leaders if your manager dislikes you and decides to put you on a pip dont expect hr to be impartial or allow you to put your case forwardthis is not the place for that the attrition rate is at an alltime high and the organization doesnt bother filling vacant positions for months instead they simply redistribute the workload among the remaining team overburdening them and leading to burnout which ultimately drives talented employees to leave
the freedom of expression and the scope is really good here you get to meet all leaders without any restrictions you can share your views and opinions seamlessly
the corporate culture of bias especially at certain level is evident few things are yet to be streamlined like responsibility vs accountability plan vs action and reflection can be better
overall company is good but the management who handle and basically they are from different regions and handling other regions are not aware how to handle the people from this locality that was the main barrier which results in poor connectivity with vendors
manager rude behaviour
20k slalary no increment as well as working from 2yrs no onroll position waste of time hard working
working as off role from 2yrs no promotion is there dont joined any position in scootsy logistics very worst organization no onroll even hr department are very disrespectful dur to no revert response worst hr department ciel swiggy working like worst than labour 1011hrs no time management no worklife balance
work from home or office just need to complete the given task
they think employees are machine how can anyone stay active 18 19 hours on a daily basis
as a fresher i leaned lot of things
more working hours no work life balance off role job little bit politics need to travel rotational shifts night worksetc
salaries are provided on time here the perks and benefits are good
the work culture and worklife balance are average promotions are rare and depend on availability
swiggy is having such an wonderful sop protocol which was impressed me a lot i have been wondered for one of the employee
personally i felt it was a wonderful journey to the core but the only thing to disappointed me was off role description for an fv quality controller
extremely supportive culture strong neutral policies good benefits
management team needs an upgrade highly amateur manager racist hinduphobic anti nationalist teammates and member who have a track record of dooming processes in their previous organization lead the environment making it toxic and hard to survive
in starting phase i get promoted 2 times in a year from picker to store manager learn a lot from there
got opportunity for area manager in night where i have to observe and take up 50 store in delhi ncr but got hold this time due to some reasons
1 team and manager
1 overburdens with too many accounts 2 clients are not happy with the product or the attention time we give them as company has other agenda towards growth
i like a job to work in swiggydelivery but this is not sufficient job salary for future incase any emergency leave there is not options to inform company
not a dislikes but more need features for future job openings in this field any chances to work swiggy
i like the most thing is team work that all the department interact and work together and every department is interlinked with each other that make the team spirit for the upgrading of our company and im proud to work in the swiggy
some of the processes that are not required and some of the process are removed that are needed and i think the employee opinion is must so that the ground level employee know the work what happened in the ground level and the asm are better than sm i am saying because they are involved in all the tasks but the sm are involved in only some of the task that make the some what efforts less
there is no proper organisation professional ethics no support from senior management or manager lot of office politics and poor decisions making from department head and manager
there is no proper rr for each position no guidance and knowledge from managers no professional work environment
working at swiggy offers several appealing aspects for employees the company provides a dynamic and fastpaced environment ideal for those who thrive on innovation and quick decisionmaking employees appreciate the culture of collaboration where new ideas are encouraged and crossfunctional teams work together to solve challenges swiggys focus on technology and datadriven approaches allows employees to learn and grow with cuttingedge tools additionally swiggy places a strong emphasis on employee wellbeing offering benefits flexibility and a supportive work culture that fosters both professional growth and worklife balance
nothing
working at swiggy has been an incredible experience for several reasons firstly the dynamic and fastpaced environment keeps me constantly challenged and motivated every day is different
while i appreciate many aspects of working at swiggy there are a few challenges that can be tough to navigate one of the main issues is the intense workload and the highpressure
not like
you never know when you will lose your job in this organization because if you do not make any reference here then no matter how hard you work you will not be promoted
lots to learn because of the hustle and fast paced nature of work
toxic work environment politics internally among employees silent frequent layoffs hike promotions are all in the air
growth perks and benefits skill development
office politics unskilled upper management they dont know about the ground reality after that they are come up with new thing to challenge competition and after few days when competition come up with the some action they will ask to drop the the charter
new learning like how to deal with different problems and give solution to your client
like for each and everything comparing with zomato you should do something different its always not good to follow ur competitor is doing you should bring something urself which will help to engage the customer on app
good work place and convention nature and religious discrimination certain community people targeting not let you to work there people only get pushing promotion
very bad manners for certain religious people for against people
1working culture is very good and positive 2team handling and understanding employees perspective is very positive signs of a good company 3 managers are very supportive and well manger
1 the only complain i have is about appraisal and promotions
at first swiggy was very good place to work but now its totally opposite
1no appraisals 2no skill learning 3 no work life balance 4 no leave policy 5 job security is like you dont know that whether may you work or not
swiggy cloud kitchen is a great place to work offering huge opportunities the work culture flexible timing increment promotion and support from hr and colleagues
nan
my experience was very amazing in swiggy at that time the workplace and work environment was good i learned so many things here met amazing people
i had only one complete they fired me on the first lockdown when i had a very bad accident
swiggy has great work culture and the leadership people are very empathetic and friendly consider us in the decision making or strategy is very appreciating
hikespromotions
it takes a village to bring a child up in the world swiggy is one such company where we matters a place to innovate cultivate and reap one must join here to build with great passion
the current changes
goodnothing to explorecompany culture employees benefits
the few bad managers are killing company ethics and integrity they work for their personal goalsnot support to sub ordinatesso end of the company loosing so much nrm i hope now will taken a action on those managersthanks
flexible working hours good team members
extreme work pressure unrealistic targets no new learnings manager is good but overburdened with work so no new learning and support from them
salary on time but its too less
unwanted and fraud penalty no fix income too less earnings restaurant and higher staff fms are not supported no value of skills
great people to work with good work life balance benefits performance linked esops
appraisals are not very well structured preference for lateral hiring versus growing existing employees
only tea and biscuit
politics politics politics management should change otherwise they will make sure it is shut with losses no idea how to manage a team they just need their owns religion peers to come n work making layoff for the really desired people who worked strong n steady n in layoff settlement again golmal proper calculation is not made wantedly n settled with lesser amount

tha hardest is heavy rainy and heavy sunny time and customer not responding and waiting long time for pickups and the order was cancelled we could send swiggy offiec staff its redicolous and didnt statisfy petrol
it could be better when people ask swiggy to rase the pricess for delivery driver and swiggy support team is the worst team i ever experienced they cant help with issue which i told them

there are lots of internal movement which i hate the most because it impact our kra and u will be put in pip and different team will treat you really bad example i was hired for swiggy store later moved for swiggy food the team was handled in horrible way all they want us to work work and work if you are not keeping well they ask you to still work and ask to complete the login hours
delhi

good company to work for job security was a concern during covid as they laid off a lot of people
no training programs especially for a person to transcend to the next role
yes i am interested
yes i am interested
work culture
there is a lot of politics and the management doesnt
this company really thinks about their employees company gives all the necessary facilities to their employees giod working environment and culture managements are transparent teammates are also very supportive
nothing to say anything
no words
everything which needed a fresher because simple work and easy
nothing
there arent noticeable things which impressed me or i liked about the firm
there is no work life balance and the management is very poor in addressing issues no complain is taken seriously as per my understanding no employee benefits to improve the skill set employee is stressed and mentally harassed with work pressure the list goes on
career growth and opportunities
job security
when some one is qualified and speaks good english and approaches for a job at these times i had been to kasturi nager for joining and fisrt of all all the employees who is supposed to do joining formalities are late no monitering security guard does all the job shame on your management after taking up the job spike to so many other employees they are working for hrs together but swiggy is one of the cheapest companies and also the biggies in the company is never bothered about the process and their employees feel sad cause most employees do not write any reviews since they are from such background
all maintenance work and chiller plumbing civil all work doing best experience in swiggy
filed work
work culture openness to challenge the status quo autonomy to an intern was amazing
nothing much honesty
sat off
a lot of internal politics only a few person who are part of organization since beginning will get promoted and saved on sacrifice of other employees no work life balance always full of end moment tasks and blame game
culture and work

many of the posts are contractual

training is not great provided by swiggy
swiggy is great place to workits where employees concerns been considered as important thing along with work
its for the people who work in sales work life balance little difficult and you cant completely isolate from work even at your difficulties you should always be on your toes
like a friendship
nice jobs
my staf behavior
my senior behavior
culture
work life balance there is no fix timings for work officially working days are monday to friday however you have to work on saturdays as well
career growth is slow for a startup its a topheavy with a lot of avps vps already so they have created an unattainable bar for promotions from gmdirector levels
growth of employees needs to be considered
there is good work environment to grow mentally and professionally managers promote only people they like
politics and job security
only thing i like about my company is that i dont have to report to anybody i work as per my will
to be honest not really happy with company sometimes gives wrong pay for orders unnecessary deductions blaming the rider even when it not their fault no proper support given to riders zero safety
yes too much
i like work of swiggy
awesome company in the world i like this company
good company
yes i want to job in sweegy insta mart
loaders work
it was amazing working with swiggy
nothing at all
teammates are supportive and the management is transparent
everything i had like
solving the issues from customers
voice listening unknown sounds
salary was paid at time
1 work life disbalances personal life 2 manager might call at 2 or 3 am and will ask for reports
this is great journey for my career and l have learnt and devloped our skills
layoff and management
swiggy treat employee as family
nice friendly work
workm
as delivery partner working experience is to good
per order given very low amount to delivery partner
work culture transparency company policies and values
career growth and job security lay off due to covid and that too with politics gender discrimination is high the reason they told me for the for the retaining of a recruiter for hrbp role during my layoff was she is a female employee and she is in a particular location anyways everyone is working from home they why there is a discrimination through location felt totally unfair for the contribution i have made for the company no proper support during the notice period
na
no increment n promotion
warehouse operations
its a great experience working with swiggy being a part of this organization gave me a great opportunity to learn many things
no need to submit

sometimes cool
no hr level support once you hired you have to work for same salary for years
me need to clarify
nothing
there is nothing about this company to like
salary deductions on no reason if we ask about the reason they dont give us a reason this is a hitler company instead corporate they cheat us on medical and accidental insurance i had met with an accident on duty and got admitted in network hospital and got approval from medibuddy to continue the treatment but at the time of discharge the total bill was 48k and they disbursed only 3102 rest i have to bear it from my pocket when i reported this to my office they clearly said we cant do anything
i feel very happy
swiggy is the best company
very good
was a good company for a fresher in 2018
no job security lot of mischief by team leaders and managers during appraisal
working culture and perks
some management issue persons are not from same trade

work culture atmosphere

no growth
whatever you doyou will still have a job at the end
its a gamblers gamethe outcomesalaryis always variable
to be at a place as sales manager and be able to make important decisions and head responsibilities that cannot be even thought of in an conventional company for a person in this role is the best part of working in swiggy one gets adapted to multi domain kra balancing it and the job profileteam moulds the person to outperform in difficult times a bit stressful and demotivating at times yet interesting
id not continue to work in the company if i dislike anything about it here i sure have differences but thats not to be a concern
skill development
work life balance
good culture good people
growth opportunities are very low
daily learn new things
payment
system work better
good communication skills
i worked in swiggy kitchen whitefield bangalore
because there are many problems they dinnot support
working parttime is good
bad customer service
i proud of swiggy i like swiggy
order poor and no solution time to time i wait long time restaurants no paid waiting charge
tremendous company to work atunless you are working in a tier3 or tier4 city the growth prospects are really goodon the flip side the work life balance is considerably lesser as you have to take on n number of calls
some managers suck here nothing more
best company in food field
ground level workers dont have freedom only those who works with computers they all one team
work at swiggy is excellentgood place to learnbut bit unhappy with our manager as he is favour to hindi people alwayslost my contract just because of our manager as he is wantedly targeted for terminate the contract suggesting hr team to take a survey at initial stage of everx employeethis would be definitely helpful for freshers to express any problems in team with team ppli got placed through ciel hr servicesin my termination hr of ciel named mohammed waqas helped me alot to get my full salary for the month

normal hai sab vaha per pressure
normal pressure on shift incharge
best but really best
no rest tension work
its good learn more in this organisation
i dont think their none point to say regarding this
it is work form home
alot of salary deduction chat flow was extremely high no time for breaks
mostly they are very supportive through thier employee but if any one who is in off roll will be always feel insecurity in his job swiggy always care thats why they allowed every employs to work from home model
the targets are always high and job security is zero in swiggy no matter how well you perform and also they never understand your family issues
management too poor
management to poor
it is waste of time and our life management are very lazy
there are only hire but not secure your job
not interested
patrol rates too high no support from team leaders they always talk to us like lots of negative attitudeall rules are hit to riders by swiggy
no support from team leaders petrol rates to high they give 5 per km how we can run this low cost
one of the best startup company in india very good work environment
promotion is not based on work performance qualifications
great work environment makes you feel like you are the owner and part of family where swiggy is best for learning and skill development whete swiggy family is supporting and transparent where you feel your target is not a pressure but goal which you want to achieve good compensation and benifts along with career growth and opportunities with promotion and annual appraisal you will find a work satisfaction and lots of happiness thank you for the journey your love and support is incredible

very nice to work with swiggy as it was an on contractual based work but its was very nice time spent with swiggy learning was awesome
swiggy given good salary and time to time
company benefits such as work from home medical insurance
the only thing thats appreciable in swiggy is their food at cafeteria
i have no idea about other teams but when it comes to ours we have a person who sacrifice the worklife balance of his subordinates for his own benefits and promotions who would allot work to people after 8 pm on saturday night utter nonsense
no job security very tight schedule of the day due to work from home no worklife balance at all also some company policies are terrible
nothing is good about the company except the brand
good experience
everything is good
less work
there is nothing good in working with swiggy as a mis because neither there is skill development nor hikepromotion only good thing is that they give less work mis work in swiggy is like data entry work nothing more than that
got lay off during corona
no career growth
my teammates and training good
good
onrole employee in swiggy is very good opportunity to learn and enhance ur skills
amazing corporate culture great seniors and team members reimbursement of salary and mediclaim during covid was amazing everyone got 6 months salary learnt a lot rules are strict but helps in the long run
i just wish swiggy didnt close the kitchens during the pandemic despite closure every staff was duly compensated salary family mediclaim learning opportunities and job help everything was taken care of
worst company in india helll
payment mode and uniform
company must increase incentive structure for executive
i am working since 2018 and i am also mba with marketing earlier company tells us that there will be growth of executive who are best executive still i am not get growth although my work is best i am still looking for fixed monthly income as being a manager in the company
brilliant company to work withlot of learnings and amicable and helpful senior management
career growth is low as new positions opens only when some one quits the companyso times there is favourism in the city team but that is seldom but might hamper career growth
hard work always pays off i cleared my 90 thousand loan just in 5 months by working 12 hours a day in swiggy as a delivery boy
theres nothing to dislike about swiggy
work structure and the management
nothing such
got to learn things how good funded startup suck the career of poor agent on the name of customer service
its not an organisation its a lab and they need lab rats to run there entire customer service with one and only department that customer service or chat agent
learn to accept challengesno need to worry about salary other benifits
management was not good

there is a lot of politics and the management doesnt address our issues salary is decent but career growth is slow there is a bond of 2 years before which you cannot resign on the job training is not given to new joinees
work culture
job security
compensation benefits are good and medical facility is also very useful thing for everyone
the compensation we have got this is appreciable however the career growth we are not getting in this covid19 pandemic we have not got replacement of job this is the very painful area of any single person of earning member and top management specially finance teamdirectorcoo are not able to maintain expenses and they wasting their amount in infrastructure and unwanted parties these are major fund has been spoiled in that particular thingswhich cause company has decided to cut of the manpower which is absolutely wrong and company reputation is going in a very bad image in market and they also lost their trusted and valuable employees
all is good
the swiggy is the best platform in lock down situation to make money for won
new technologies
its a political platform not the food platform
i received a good exposure and learnt a lot in swiggy got two promotions in two years and not only me few other colleagues of mine also got quick promotions compensation sucks and they do not give much salary 18al a year and 12 cl however in an agent level you might have to struggle with data accuracy especially with schedule adherence you work for 8 hours but system says you worked for 5 hrs and no one will beleive you swiggy needs to seriously look into data accuracy
already explained above
great extent of exposure but compensation jobsatisfaction was very poor could be leadership has great vision and mission but at city level its all misinterpreted misguided or lost the benefits are best fitted with hq and not extended to other tier 1 cities learning and development is at ones own hand company does not participate in equipping you with the right skills to do your job
compensation jobsatisfaction is very poor could be lack of leadership intervention and the vision mission at city level everything is misinterpreted misguided or lost the benefits are best shared with hq tier 1 cities await for company to look after its employees learning and employee development is at ones own hand company does not participate in equipping you with the right skills to do your job career path growth is lacking in the system the company is running haywire when it comes to providing a functional solution to ones career no growth except to enter into sales every other department is drafted to meet its end by choosing to outsource or hc reduction module hope many things change
swiggy work is excellent and insurance very fast problem solve
skill development learning

work culture is so good as well as policy of the company
career growth slow
i like very much of all the staffs always supporting us and culture and policies of the company is very very good it helps us much

it was very good place to work but last year they threw all employees without giving any hope they crushed all dreams leave them in dark

good work environment and culture teammates are supportive and the management is transparent there is a huge cafeteria and gaming arcade for chilling company policies are good appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year

the decision taken by the higher management
very good company good experience
management
work culture falt organization structure
job insecurity which has become evident after onset of covid

partiality is more big week point in mumbai main person is rohit e patil is wrost manager over there also top fleet managers attritions he was done in his periods now he is the operation manager i totally dislike this mamager behaves his culture and his partialatic nature no one was action against him it just my suggestion remove him from your company and save lots of great managers job that it
excellent work life balance very less work pressure youth oriented culture good salary and incentives
office politics less growth opportunity very less increments
if u r a learner dont expect salary growth skills u can learn
nice
swiggy
best of think ye h ki celery on time first of good think and 2 of think thats a good brand rule and regulation in strik but 1 think of not good this company a asking all chef a equally thats not a good for brand har insan ke andar aapne aapne aalag aalag quality aur quality hote h aeshe m work pe dhyan koi nhi deta
all over experience is good thanku swiggy team but all chefs are not equal
it very learning and progressive experiencework culture was great and management also good
good work environment and culture teammates are supportive and the management is transparent there is a huge cafeteria and gaming arcade for chilling company policies are good appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year
due to corona viruse the kitchen was closed permanently
nice
not even helped me in pandemic time shit company specially my new boss shiva kumar
to be frank not even company helped in pandemic also shit company an they force fully resignation i want to mention the shit manager specially actually he is fit for to be manager lofer shiva kumar cvr 2 kitchen he spoiled many peoples life defenitely i hope so even live a peace life
true candidate always get and deserve here
teammates are supportive
there is a lot of politics and the management doesnt address our issues salary is decent but career growth is slow managers are giving appraisal for how much you provide oiling to him not for your performance seniors are doing flexible shift and juniors are doing hard shift daily basis like early morning night shift etc
the company provides open and free culture and environment for the employees also the facilities provided are good
the company environment and other things are too good but the team leaders have a very bad attitude not all team leaders but in my city my team leader was rude and full of attitude but in other cities i did not see the same

one of the best company i have worked for and completely people oriented
nothing unfortunately due to covid bombay and pune operation closed and i have lost my jobi wish this company again flourish in mumbai and pune
work culture
layoffs
good working environment all team members are supportivei really like this company if i get chance again working with this company i will definitely join i always my staff and senior
i dont like any thing about this company
after the new dis vishal shaw came swiggy lost all its photographers in kolkata that guy has no idea and knowledge about photography and he is there because he knows swiggy senior team members the whole swiggy team of kolkata has lost its reputation
work culture is poor the dis vishal shaw is pathetic has zero knowledge about his field photography he is rude and cheap and lies to the team
best job in hospitality and like the team work love company policies
there is lot of politics because there are no promotion for me and no salary increased but discreased my salary after transfer
great culture
something its hectic
i like the work culture in swiggy they are friendly and supportive in their works but our team got layoff due to this pandemic
i cant dislike working in swiggy because i have learned so many things here
work life balance
no growth
it was nice work experience compare to star hotel new concept of food
nothing much to say about dislike only thing is growth is here very slow
a very good company and salary is also paid on time in this difficult situation they have supported a lot
nothing as such
yes
yes
veri excellent
swiggy is a very larjesece company or l like this swiggy company
the company is open to innovation and readily adopts latest technology i love the fact that im a part of a team that markets reliablehighquality product and has a global customers
1compensation is decent but growth is slow the work pressure is highsometimes i have to work 14 to 18 hours straight in a day
very beautiful environment and biggest support from the organisation end
there is no any bad things which happened to me
about swiggy iam so happy working there but i resigned from their before corona due to some personal reasons the work culture and management of swiggy was excellent
the work timing is a bit difficult
very bed experience
very bed experience
worst company ever
no growth
all i can think of is how thoughtfully they handle any situation a very talented management skills in all aspects
tier 2 or 3 cities opinions are never collected about anything should change that way
they are supporting very well for onroll but not much about offroll employees those who have great contribution in city
being offroll company not going to renew contract in this crusual time this is very disappointing otherwise work culture is very good
seles
swiggy
im very proud in this company and hit gives helpful feature also
yes
good
well swiggy provides you ownership good salary and also swiggy respect your idea that you can put it your own way
slow growth is big issue because i am looking for promotion from last 3 month but i did not satisfying answer from hr team
terrible work experience no professionalism no career growth selfish people
selfcentered senior managers no prior work experience required to get a job if you come from iit or iim they will offer you top leadership
network charges they are providing
management
nice job
company took good care of employees and offered work from home even before corona was wide spread they provide lot of options for employees like covid insurance and always striving to help employees in hard times
culture to grow flexible and let there employees grow on there own pace
in covid i feel lack of communication
good management cooperative seniors overall good work environment
shutting the business with short notice
it was a good compeny and good environment and culture safety and security
excellent work culture supportive environment learning opportunities
job security at times
thank you
thank you
working culture is too good and every one is very supportive
no job security recently i have lost my job
ok
they are providing me family insurance but right now i am afraid of my job
nothing everything is fine

very nice journey in swiggy 5 years experience is very good service and lost of moment i am not forget my hub members
very nice company would like to join again if possible
no job security
worst culture
no job security my sincere advice dont join to this company the work will very high
working culture
mid level management not able to understand process and how company work they just sit for regular monthly salary and forward mails
complete 9 hr like job salary timing and training session etc
housekeeping management and staff food qualities
work life balance company policies fair salary structure and timely paymets
i am not at all agree with the word dislike
concept of doing more with less
politics
hii
yas
they chucked so many ppl out without even any warning or letting us know the criteria why we are being chucked out in this pandemic
it just hires and fires you will find very few ppl here who are working for more than 3 years
skill development is good
poor job security no work flexibility
salary deduction not happened
3000 employees layed off rest did off roll
its seem to be over all is very good to see you for the swiggy i like to follow up standard maintained the quality
my side all of us is very good dont any things dislike for my job
i love the fact that i am a part of a team that markets reliable
more growth and security of job is must carrer growth and job security is the most valuable things in todays condition of market
this was the horrible experience in my life still suffering due to covid company has made the layoff
it was the great experience in my life learn lot more thing new
swiggy is first company i work with i like this delivery process our managers is friendly nature one thing of swiggy i like very much we are providing food easily and earn money with that
sometimes call center is wasting des time during the order and delivery time is very low traffic signal time can not cover in delivery time and if customer live 7th floor in building then we go 7th floor that time in travelling from ground floor to 7th floor this time is not include in delivery time otherwise i dont any issues about my work in swiggy
job security is very week
off roll
very supportive invoirmentthere was so friendly atmosphere with all those colleagues who was working with swiggy
there was nothing to dislike about that
i like swiggy brand nd more improve nd standard exactly i accepted
lot of learning that how to working process of e commerce and food delivery company
lot of politics
everything was awesome
i dont have word on this because everything was awesome in swiggy
environment was good in swiggy
they dont givepromotions for restaurant executives
overall swiggy is a good company
no support they have layed off from the job
inside politics salary is decent
it is forward thinking company
the philosophies followed are incorrect retrenchment is taken as part of life
working at swiggy is an awesome experience one thing i would love to address is to everyone seeking job is that you only get paid if you fulfill all the kras assigned to you swiggy is the nicest place to learn and grow i would highly recommend anyone who gets the chance to join that please do not bring a second thought for working in swiggy just go for it
nothing is there to be disliked everything is perfectly fine

there are many more learning and gain good working experience and a good team support here
there are no any proper response from upper managements to last mile employees if any senior doing bad behaviour with us
flexibility stretch
culture work life bl
work culture people work ethics values learning curve
processes growth personal learning
it should be named as rotten eggs
chor hain ye mehanat ki kamai rakh lete hain kaam karne ke baad bewajah penalties laga kar 1500 ko 850 kar dete hain ye worst experience working with such an idiot organization
nothing to like about this left in less than 7 months pathetic pathetic culture full of politics and toxicity
longest working hours will make you work on weekends as well constant bashing never appreciate unrealistic expectations
nothing
worst platform to work on support is worst and company is worst they are just sitting to take money from you if you earn they wont even give you that money and once you call their worst support team they will give you shit reasons lyk your earnings might got deducted for tds or panaltywhen asked to give proper reason to check they clearly denied and disconnected the call i will make sure to take this legal and sue this company
company is good for employees but management hr team is not doing well for employees management team is only thinking about his relatives favourite person in team he is providing him desired shift working hours leave off promotions appraisal
management team is behaving very bad with employees
swiggy application and payments are good
there is no proper support channel for delivery agents even though all the restaurants are getting closed by 1100 pm swiggy management team is encouraging to book slots at midnight to get paid for 150 for 3 orders in 2 hrs where we are getting hardly 1 order swiggy need to develop itself in the booking and zones scheduling it should establish a proper human connected help support channel as even delivery staff have concerns to resolve at the earliest a satisfied employee can inculcate more business than a customer coz a staff is one who represents the company when we call to customer service and requesting for some assistance for delivery agent they are simply answering that they dont have any service to assist the staff and there is no other way except mailing to help support not every de is so much executed to mail their concern to the team and this review is on behalf of them kindly arrange a delivery executive care or support for an enhanced business and cooperation from every staff tq
the work culture at swiggy promotes collaborative learning and progress of each individual if you question a decision with a logic people listen to you and incorporate the suggestions if found logical
work life balance is a mess here since you are supposed to act like owner you tend to forget about your personal life and think swiggy even when on vacations
lot of things to learn you need to prove your stone each and everyday
zero work life balance i have been taking medication for different different things because of this have been to doctor 3 times in last 3 months
most of them are smart in getting work from others
no proper work channel most of them are likely to be dislike role of work and ready to get from others its not good for company growth
culture and learning opportunities
blur long term vision

very third class experience with swiggu instamart
nothing to like
floating cash is a big scam here when you earn and on some cod customers sometime pay via cash which i think will be adjusted from our earnings but this amount was deducted from my earnings as well as added in floating cash which was too deducted again in future earnings

as swiggy operates through its online platforms it is known to promote 247 customer service it has thrived to maintain a good relationship with its customer issues and services we all have seen people getting refunds if the user is not satisfied with the food or service

i like the managing this orgnisation systemand tracking point about the operation in the swiggy
doesnt dislike any policy for this orgnisation
in pool of 1000s of startups there are very few which makes big and i know the reason for it now more than anything if an organisation wants to make it big it needs to have rich and inspiring culture so that it can carry 1000s of employees towards a unified goal swiggy has done this perfectly no matter the stint once a swiggster is always a swiggster great people you get to work with some of the smartest but most humble people great work company is continuously innovative so you can get to work of tough but satisfying challenges good pay org pays on par with industry and promotes based on merits rather than age or tenure

working as a manager it gives you strength and learnings of team handling work process its not only about work but also a respect to the post as the company is newly opened and hope are high for getting promoted faster according to my peformance its the good company to work with to get a good experience on a ecommerce food sector which gives you a good knowledge of industries
accordingly the salary expected here is much lower than expected working for continous long shifts and late nights to get the work done which doesnt ends on a time we dont get appreciation from the time being everyone wants here to get there work done thats it the salary promised and paying is variancedont get any kind of appreciation here just to come and get the work done for the shift you being there and get out sometimes working or learning from or by seniors doesnt workout good

kras calculated incorrectly to justify less salary hikes toxic work culture gas lightings pretty common no help from supervisor you will have to figure out everything on your own if your manager is ankur book sessions with a psychiatrist and a psychologist even that may not help they have education support but wont allow you to avail when the time comes they will force you work in shifts that coincides with your education commitments leaves are only granted to people who are married or celebrate festivals with their families
time is flexible rotational shift work from home facilities
they treat employees like they are robot chat flow can be increased any time without prior notice you have to handle it otherwise there will be mark downs and suspensions if some protocols are not followed which are very hard to follow when there are 67 active chat also there are perfomance target u have to maintain if flow of the chat were less this is the best job anyone can ever have

few things are ok few things are not ok i personally like the employees caring i mean medical caring for their families also not only them and their families also
i didnt like the data data data what ever you do or not i mean your working or not dont care but if you submit the required data to the management they dont even least bother about you end of the day data and the worst part meeting weekly meeting monthly meeting annual meeting again daily con call in google meet your life will end up with meeting only and you wont get time to do your work on floor
