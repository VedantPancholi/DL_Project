"I ordered food around 7.30 pm, it should get delivered by 30 mins which I am not aware since 1st time ordered food on swiggy. It should be delivered from manyata Bangalore to opposite of manyata. Sad thing due to heavy traffic it was delayed by 30 mins. So around 8.30 got my food. Delivery boy apologized for that.I am not aware of the timely delivery concept with swiggy. While am eating I found my money refunded to my account as per the policy.Really I Don know whether it affects the delivery boy salary. I could not find his number to contact. Really felt very bad if my food is from his pocketContinue ReadingI ordered food around 7.30 pm, it should get delivered by 30 mins which I am not aware since 1st time ordered food on swiggy.

Kindly requesting depending on traffic/peak hours, enable your timely delivery concept.One should have food without any worry. I had my food by thinking this. Treat well your delivery boys.Nothing will happen if I have my food Lil later.They need to drive . I Don know how he rashly came. But seen many people drives very fastly for delivering the food.God bless them."
"Swiggy takes its customers for granted!I really loved Swiggy.Loved. Past tense.I loved how wide the coverage is, the range of restaurants it has partnered with, the speed, and Swiggy Super, even!But… Something as trivial as this incident can really make such an impact that a business can lose a serious, committed customer.I’ve faced many many problems because of their poor customer service. More than problems, the resolution has been terrible.I’ve always used Zomato and I absolutely love their customer service. But I wanted to give Swiggy a chance.The first couple of orders were really great.Continue ReadingSwiggy takes its customers for granted!I really loved Swiggy.Loved. Past tense.I loved how wide the coverage is, the range of restaurants it has partnered with, the speed, and Swiggy Super, even!But… Something as trivial as this incident can really make such an impact that a business can lose a serious, committed customer.I’ve faced many many problems because of their poor customer service. More than problems, the resolution has been terrible.I’ve always used Zomato and I absolutely love their customer service. But I wanted to give Swiggy a chance.The first couple of orders were really great. But then started its series of misfortunate events. For me.The one that really ticked me off was this one particular order. This happened a couple of weeks ago.I ordered a risotto from the Bowl Company. Things I found off with it, you ask?The quality of rice. We know good exotic food doesn’t come cheap. We know the kind of money we have to pay to get a risotto. They send me risotto made with regular rice.Ok…? Is this really worth talking about on Quora?The next thing. Salt. A whole ton of salt. I was eating the Dead Sea.Hmmm. Another petty thing.Can it get worse? A bell pepper risotto is what I ordered. What do I receive? Regular rice, overly seasoned with I don’t know, amount of salt that can burst your blood vessels, and NO BELL PEPPER! Turned out to be plain rice!LOLOk. Still sounds very small minded.But this is what really ticked me off.So, I was letting a Deepali (Customer care at Swiggy) know what the problem is. I explained to her that the food was, well, you know, all those things I mentioned above (phew!). NOT EDIBLE.And she goes, “I’ll let the concerned restaurant know.”Ok, so what’s the resolution then?Absolutely nothing!I asked for a refund for the meal I ordered. Clearly, the sane thing to do after what had just happened.She goes, “Can I give you a 25 Rs off on your next order?”Oh no, you didn't!First of all, “Can I give you?” like she’s doing me a favor. And, secondly, 25 Rs? What on earth will I do with 25 Rs when my bill was 200 Rs for a crappy risotto delivered?“I’m sorry, this is all I can do to help.”I immediately uninstalled the app, thanks to Deepali, and wrote this on Google Play.I also subscribed to Swiggy Super, but their resolution is offering 25 bucks. Like that's going to make a difference. And their pretentious bot answers don’t really help either.“We won’t keep you waiting while you’re hungry.” and all kinds of stupid crap.Never going back to Swiggy."
"★I am from Gurgaon. Here is a full list of issues I have faced.Latest24/11/2015 : Another blunder. Copy of email I sent them.Order delivered from Amigos. Had ordered from Dosa Xpress. This is second time that this has happened. Delivery boy is shameless, says it from Dosa Xpress only, although restaurant bill clearly states the name ""Amigos"". Customer care is same. She says, sounding naive that as the item was not available at the ordered restaurant, it was delivered from somewhere else. As if they reserve the right to do so. Do they even think before they speak or they consider the customerContinue Reading★I am from Gurgaon. Here is a full list of issues I have faced.Latest24/11/2015 : Another blunder. Copy of email I sent them.Order delivered from Amigos. Had ordered from Dosa Xpress. This is second time that this has happened. Delivery boy is shameless, says it from Dosa Xpress only, although restaurant bill clearly states the name ""Amigos"". Customer care is same. She says, sounding naive that as the item was not available at the ordered restaurant, it was delivered from somewhere else. As if they reserve the right to do so. Do they even think before they speak or they consider the customer to be stupid. I don't know what the hell kind of startup you guys are building there. Also lost all my 15 rupees phone balance as I was put on hold for long. No callback from your side. Pathetic. Useless. Worthless. Ethicsless if that's a word. Had only ordered as I wanted to finish my Swiggy balance. Refund everything, not in swiggy balance but in cash/cheque. I would like to speak to your CEO as everyone else ( concerned departments) has been useless, as the past and present shows. Future seems to be the same to me. Hopeless.Also, the dosa was complete crap.Also, the person I spoke to last time for good 40 minutes, told me its company policy to not show the customer, the restaurant bill. To him :1. Please read your FAQ section.2. Try to place an order on swiggy and see what message appears when you place it.Seems like he is unaware of the company policy. Better learn it, before mentioning the words ""company policy"". Stupid.Ordered from ""Om Sweets"". The stupid delivery boy got the food from ""Shamji"". I just don't how this can happen. Next day I get a call:Swiggy : Hi, there was some issue in your order last night.Me        : Yes, I had ordered from ""Om Sweets"". The delivery boy got the food from ""Shamji"".Swiggy : Thank you for your feedback.Just this? I was like, What the hell. They treated as if it was a small issue. I myself did not try to escalate it by calling them back, as the delivery boy begged me not to do that, as that could cost him his job. But still, no initiative from their side. I wonder how this order could have got processed internally.Don't they see that they are making the payment to a completely different restaurant.Had to eat that, after waiting for  1/2 hour, because by the time the delivery boy went back to get the correct order, ""Om Sweets"" had stopped making the ordered items.Simply pathetic.2.  They are cheating customers.They charge you VAT and Service Tax, even though the restaurant doesn't.Even if the restaurant charges the taxes, there is a serious discrepancy between what the restaurant charges, which is reflected in the bill generated by the restaurant and what swiggy charges, which is reflected in the online bill.Mostly, it is overcharging on Swiggy side. So, either don't order from them or if you do, please check the restaurant bill.3. This is related to the tax calculation on Swiggy site.Two different restaurants. Both restaurants are shown to charge both VAT and Service Tax.Same before tax bill amount. Still the tax calculations for the two restaurants were different.4.Delivery boy was rude and impolite. One time, the delivery boy could not find my house. I was giving him instructions on phone on how to get there. And he was constantly saying ""Kya Yaar""(English : ""What the hell, man"").5.Ordered ""Mysore Masala Dosa"", got ""Masala Dosa"". Few days back, I ordered ""Mysore Masala Dosa"" from ""Bikanervala"". Instead got ""Masala Dosa"". There were even differences between the prices of the two. Again, I wonder how could this order get processed. Don't they see the difference between the bill amount which they generated and which the restaurant generated. Got a call later :Swiggy : The restaurant says that they had given ""Mysore Masala Dosa"" only.I was like, what is there to ask the restaurant about. Can't you see the bill, the restaurant  generated. You must be having a copy of that. It had clearly mentioned ""Masala Dosa"". You guys even made the payment for that which was of different amount from the bill you guys generated for me. Can't you notice that. How can you even process that.They just don't check where they are making the payment and of what amount.6. I was once able to make an order from a place which does not deliver to my location and the order got processed. Again don't they check where the order  is from and what are the bounds of delivery.7. While placing order, I have to pin point the exact location of my house with a marker on a map, on the Swiggy site. Still, I get calls from delivery boys, to explain me how to reach my home. I mean, what's the point of all this. Can't they just use that. I have marked the exact location on the map. Why ask for it, when you don't use it.8.The delivery bikes don't have any boxes or containers, like the ones Dominos or Pizza Hut have at their back, to carry the items.The delivery boys usually carry it in their hands. One time, the delivery boy carried the order in a laptop kind of personal bag. Also, no uniform for the delivery boys.9.They should keep track of closing days of the restaurant.Few days back, ordered from a restaurant. Few minutes later order got cancelled because the restaurant was closed that day.10.No order history before September. Was trying to look into my order history today. But can't find any orders I had made before September. Can't you guys even keep 2 months old data?11.Once ordered Chicken roll. Got delivered Chicken tikka. Again nobody noticed that? The delivery boy blindly picks up the order?12. At a restaurant, some dish got served only after 19:30. It was 19:35, and the website was still showing those items inactive. Opened mobile app and guess what, the items were active. Filled my cart on the app. Then logged in using website again. The items were there in the cart but, in the menu still showing inactive. Placed the order using the site. Again, what the hell is happening there.13.  Once ordered Pav Bhaji. The dish got spilled, but was still in the packaging. Was very hungry. So ate it, without raising the issue.14. No Edit Profile Option. There is no option to edit your details once you have signed up.15.  Changed my password using the website. The app doesn't ask for the new password. Continues to work on the previous one.16.Swiggy bill Rs.200, restaurant bill Rs.202. Again, how? Rounding doesn't explain this.17.Swiggy bill 160, restaurant bill 157.18.  Delivery boy forgot the restaurant bill.But swiggy still had a soft copy of that. I asked for it because of all the previous instances. They twice mailed me the swiggy bill, not the restaurant bill.19. App shows my balance to be 0 although I still have Rs.20 left.Most of the time, I got  calls from this girl named Akansha from Swiggy side. I have found no improvement on their side. Wonder if I could provide feedback about her and her department to Swiggy.Earlier I used to enthusiastically provide my suggestions and reviews, hoping they will improve. Now, it feels like I am complaining to a Government Office. Hopeless.They seriously need to learn about customer service and retention from Amazon. I think they are just waiting to get acquired by a bigger fish.So, either don't order from them or if you do, please check the restaurant bill and your complete order."

"I have read many answers right under this thread. Some of them found Swiggy very useful and some of them backlashed at its failures. I don't want to make you engaged again and again by writing same about the delay in food delivery, packaging fault, cashback policies or about that sensational delivery boy who ate from food orders. But I want to throw some light from a different perspective.Delivery Boys.No no no!Delivery Girls!(Women would be more respectful)Last week we people(group of 5 friends)planned to have so called kitty party in one of our friend's house.

I don't want to make you engaged again and again by writing same about the delay in food delivery, packaging fault, cashback policies or about that sensational delivery boy who ate from food orders. But I want to throw some light from a different perspective.Delivery Boys.No no no!Delivery Girls!(Women would be more respectful)Last week we people(group of 5 friends)planned to have so called kitty party in one of our friend's house. So as per the plan we met, laughed at each other and started hitting UNO cards. And when the time was around 2′O clock in the afternoon our stomachs started to groan.So with so many coupons in the wallet, What would typical youngsters do?Orders food online!And here comes the real deal when weordered food and started tracking it. The name of delivery boy displayed was Lakshmi.Wait! Oh what???Initially there was a bit of confusion. So we called the person and yes! The delivery person was a woman. Until this, we even don't know that women are permissible to do this.After a few moments of brain storming, all of us are in all praises forSwiggy.In a moderate and developing cities like Vijayawada(In the state of Andhra Pradesh,India)we have seen hundreds of students working part time to meet their educational expenditure. Perhaps some of them are even lending their hand in support to their families.In an employability dry phase of this generation, alot of youth getting employed through online food delivery apps is indeed a boon we concluded.And while we are completely soaked in this discussion after an hour or so, here came the delivery person, Lakshmi.In order to not to embarrass her, we have sent our aunty to attend the door bell and received the order. And when she(Lakshmi) was about to leave the building premises I gazed through one of the windows from the upstairs.She was in her early 30’s I guess, delivering food through here Activa. She has been down there along with her 2 kids. To my surprise, both of her kids are studying from one of the top schools from our locality. Might be she has picked them directly from the school meanwhile through her journey to our location.And when our aunty told that she is a widow mother of two, I was deeply moved.I am truly amazed by her will power. Probably she might have very little educational qualification and yet when I see how she's handling her kids and the family status quo, I felt proud at her parenting and how she had had shouldered all the duties just like a bird gaurding her newly borns in a tiny nest. I was really fortunate to witness all this scenes. Inspiration kind of venom surged through every nerve.Alot of people speak about women empowerment and feminism and draws all the bloody shit points which are of no use. But I felt I need to say this.Thank you Swiggy for adopting such enthralling HR policies to recruit females and evenly considering potential enough along with men."
"This is going to be a rant.I installed swiggy just today and made my first order. I was quite happy(though short-lived) that i was getting a discount of about 50% for the order price.I ordered a dish from a restaurant I often visit personally and knew that it is great. So i ordered the dish and waited for delivery. To my surprise, What I was delivered wasn't half of what I eat at the restaurant ordering the same dish. I immediately logged to swiggy for registering my grievance. I couldn't get the stupid care executives to acknowledge the mistake let alone registering the complaint.

I knew that I have been cheated.However what appalled me is the attitude of care executivesof these food delivery appsSee ?? She marked it closed on her end without any resolution. They claim to be customer centric company.I MEAN FOR GOD SAKE YOU ARE CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE, YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO RESOLVE CUSTOMER ISSUES. DAMN IT, YOU ARE BEING PAID FOR IT. IF YOU ARE INCOMPETENT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE ON YOUR OWN, WHY NOT FORWARD IT TO YOUR SENIOR WITH A NOTE ??What really got to me was the fact that she tried to bribe me with Rs. 100 coupon.Why am I not surprised. We, indians as a whole are pathetic. I mean we have turned digitally corrupts. The companY(swiggy here) didnot even acknowledge the complaint while the person whose sole job is this tried to brush the issue by offering a meagre coupon. Just utter bull crap for a company that is into food delivery without any integrity."
"Malpractices occur in every business. Swiggy is also involved in this at the time of billing.Yesterday night, I ordered from a wellknown restaurant of Vadodara and then the issue started.Let me attach the screenshots.In the above screenshot, it is clearly mentioned that the rate of Pav Bhaji is 71 rupees and the actual is 95 rupees.Now, look at the above image.The pav Bhaji is priced at 95*3 instead of 71. Same is the case of Chole Kulcha.They have actually billed at the price that is striked off instead of their discounted price.This comes to a total of 285+95(chole)= 380The actual billing shContinue ReadingMalpractices occur in every business.

It is upto us how to take this bill as.One would say, this is not a big difference but the reality is these are gimmicks to make you a fool and think this is not a big thing.Think upon if the order would have been of higher price then it would be a matter.I did not face like this anytime in Zomato. They had proper billing from the restaurant.Attaching the screenshot for the Zomato order for the same dishes and quantity. You can clearly see the difference. In the below image, the prices are calculated at the discounted price and the price comes to 304 instead of 380 like above.P.S. The Pav in PavBhaji was raw one with butter very less applied. Same as the case with Kulcha in Chole Kulcha.SWIGGY, you have just started operating in Vadodara and such issues would affect your sales. I only order on Zomato from such a long time due to their transparency. Such petty issues and that too on billing would give you bad reviews and less sales.Edit1: Received call in the evening from Swiggy and explained them the issues and the scenario. They told they will into the matter and have given the coupon same as worth of the food. Hope they work on the issues which can boost their sale."
Lately observed that price of items listed in Swiggy were increased a lot around 30% for each item.Out of curiosity reached one of restaurant and compared the prices. It was shocking that restaurant didn’t revised the price but Swiggy and Uber eats both listing the items ₹70 - ₹100 more for each item.I had ordered five items which billed including GST was ₹772. The same items are billed by Swiggy was ₹1148.This is absolutely looting.Charging an delivery amount is acceptable but listing with there own price for each item is not acceptable.Restaurant billSwiggy orderPlease be aware and do not loContinue ReadingLately observed that price of items listed in Swiggy were increased a lot around 30% for each item.Out of curiosity reached one of restaurant and compared the prices.

"Swiggy the online food delivery is a good concept but at the same time they need to do some changes in chennai for delivery executives..They are asking 700 rupees to pay for two T-shirts, delivery bag and rain coat then they will deduct 800 from your two weeks salary so totally 1500.. Y? delivery executives work for your company then why you need to get amount from them.First two weeks delivery executives will never get salary.And one more thing company won’t provide petrol allowance so we need to bare.People who can manage their one month expenses can join swiggy in chennai because you can’tContinue ReadingSwiggy the online food delivery is a good concept but at the same time they need to do some changes in chennai for delivery executives..They are asking 700 rupees to pay for two T-shirts, delivery bag and rain coat then they will deduct 800 from your two weeks salary so totally 1500.. Y? delivery executives work for your company then why you need to get amount from them.First two weeks delivery executives will never get salary.And one more thing company won’t provide petrol allowance so we need to bare.People who can manage their one month expenses can join swiggy in chennai because you can’t make any profit at the first month.A simple calculationRs 700 at the time of joiningtwo weeks no salary only the third week you will get salary of the first week then second week salary will be released on 4th week. So they will hold two weeks salary that will be released at the time of relieving.So first two weeks petrol allowance 2500 even if you take a good mileage bike.So for four weeks nearly 5000.400 + 400 will get deducted from 3rd week salary and 4th week salary.Third week salary even if you take 15 orders you will get only 3600+750 incentives that too you need to login on time for full timers not for part timers only get incentives on weekends.It is bit hard to make 5000 per week.so for the first month your expenses are 700+5000+400+400=6500Per delivery Rs40 with in 4km radius if it is 8kms then Rs80.So your returns and profit (Two weeks salary will get hold = 3rd week and 4th week (4350 + 4000=8350) that too we are not sure that we will get 15 orders every day so per day atleast we can earn 450.Even after taking 15 orders per day see the profit for the first month swiggy delivery boys get 8350 - 6500 = 1850 so this will be your first month salary.Highest person who earns in swiggy as a delivery executive in chennai Rs21500 per month don’t get excited if he gets 21500 ask him how much he spends for petrol allowance and work timings.The truth is you can earn 12000 to 16000 per month but just think about petrol allowance.In swiggy they will tell that there is a customer review incentives that too we need to get 4.5 to 4.75 for Rs750 per month as incentives and 4.75 to 5 Rs1000 per month. Do you think we delivery boys will get this.. NO because the restaurant people will make delay of making food then customer will get frustrated so sure he won’t give star rating.Per order 45mins but in restaurant they will take nearly 20 to 30 minutes to serve even if we go for directly to the restaurant the same time will taken then within 15mins of time the delivery boy has to rush so the fault is on restaurant person and the company management but the delivery boy will get the blame from customers.Need to do more changes in swiggy especially in chennai branch."
"Swiggy is not worth and can not stand in this increasing competition of food ventures. They must know by just opening a site is just not enough, atleast they must teach their executives how to talk to customers and treat them.My worst experiance occured when i ordered from this site. One of the items was undelivered, though I paid for the whole order.. I tried to ignore by just calling once their executives but the way they responded was too negative for me to not lose my cool. Rather than suggesting a solution, the customer ""care"" executive disconnected my call without explaining anything.Continue ReadingSwiggy is not worth and can not stand in this increasing competition of food ventures.

The amount of order was nothing as comapred to the phone bills it took me to call them.I strongly recommend not to order from swiggy ever, and when asked for the cashback they kept my call on hold for about half an hour...WORST initiative to open a food venture ever.. Never order.. I still don't know the exact status of my complaint , but they should clearly know that untill and unless they learn how to satisfy their customers they can not even start their race in this ever increasing competition.."
"I was in Bangalore for few months and I used to live in a paying guest.One night, my roommates and I decided to order McDonald's burger from swiggy. We ordered 6 burgers and applied some offers so the order was around 450 something.After about 45 minutes later, delivery boy came with our order. We all girls were very excited, because food at paying guest was pathetic and we needed some change. We all ran at the gate and delivery boy gave us our order.We went into the room and unpacked our order, and boom . There were only 4 burgers in the package and we ordered 6 burgers.

We all ran at the gate and delivery boy gave us our order.We went into the room and unpacked our order, and boom . There were only 4 burgers in the package and we ordered 6 burgers. We cross checked our order in swiggy app and it was 6 burgers and 450 was the amount we paid. So mistake was not ours for sure.Then we checked the bill attached to the parcel box.There you go, bill was for 4 burgers and it was worth 290 something.Order was misplaced.We called delivery boy and told him all the scenario. He refused to admit his mistake. So we all girls started shouting at him that we will complain about him. Then he said, request for refund in app.We requested him to come back and give correct order to us, he refused it by saying he is stuck in traffic.We tried to contact Macdonald's…Nothing happened. We tried to contact swiggy on live chat… all the replies we received was system generated.We did everything we could to get our money or order back for almost 1 hour. But nothing happened. Finally we shared 4 burgers in 6 girls. We were hungry and by the time mess food was over too. I almost cried.Similar incident happened with my sister as well.Bad Bad Bad experience with swiggy.I don't have a single good experience with swiggy.I also came across the fact that, the price they show us in app is always Higher that the actual price of food on restaurant menu card. Similar experience I read on quora by many people.If a product is for ₹ 100, swiggy will show it to you as ₹ 120 and then they say 10 rs off on this food product. Discount is a myth and never trust prices displayed on swiggy. you pay extra charges along with delivery charges.Bad experience with swiggy majority of the times.Never used it again.Peace!"

The order was not met with the specified requirements which mayhave caused an allergic reaction.

I still let it go.The third time Swiggy failed me beyond any redemption was when Iordered again on the same night around 10:00 pm with the order id104071****. THE FOOD WAS NOT DELIVERED and I was not informed. In fact, I got a call from Swiggy asking for a choice of a different dishgiven that a particular dish in the order is not available. Afterabout one hour, when the food was not delivered I called Swiggy for anorder update only to learn that the order was cancelled withoutinforming me and I will not get any food.Their way of handling their customers is very unprofessional. In one of calls after I sent in an email regarding these instances I was offered a dessert to call truce. Several customer care calls that took place during the wrong order was like ""Sir, please speak to X person, I am not right one."" Talking to the X person, ""Sir please speak to the Y person, I am not the right one"" and this happened for like 30 minutes. Well, I am surely not ordering from Swiggy anytime soon."

Although, some companies take it to a whole new level.It delivers food from restaurants that don’t have their own delivery service, so good for customers. It is prompt at refund if order is cancelled within 5 mins of booking. It is the one that started with real-time updates on delivery status - and all this is fab!However, despite such great features, it messed up its core offering itself - restaurant reviews!!Recently I switched to Swiggy from Zomato for this delivery service they offer. I filter restaurants with 4.3+ reviews and order food.It was going fine, until…I ordered from a restaurant with 4.4 rating.It was a restaurant close to my place and I was surprised I never heard of such a good restaurant, so I googled it. To my surprise, it was a shabby restaurant and I am a lover of street food so shabbiness is not my top priority, on the contrary I feel smaller the vendor, tastier it is. But when I googled images, it was a rather unclean place for a food joint.I googled reviews and the feedback was mediocre to bad.I looked up its rating on Zomato and it had a rating of 3.1, with many bad reviews!Anyway, I thought, 4.4 is worth a try, so I didnt cancel the order. And to my utter surprise, it was pathetic food, the food reeked of bad smelling oil. I had ordered 3 dishes and it all went down the dustbin! It was a good learning to not trust Swiggy, but I wish it had costed me less.I understand different customers have different ratings for restaurants, but a restaurant as good as 4.4 needs to have good reviews everywhere! It cant have great reviews at one place and mediocre-bad reviews at other places! Afterall, Google/Swiggy/Zomato have same set of foodie customers reviewing them.Anyway, these days even reviews are tampered with, Zomato is more trustworthy of the 2. For the same restro Swiggy will have 4+ rating, while Zomato will have lower rating for sure, it has many 3+ restros, few 4+ restros with honest reviews.For example - Sagar Ratna’s one of the outlets is 4.4 on Swiggy and 3.3 on Zomato, that’s a huge difference. Swiggy gave 4+ to almost all restros, RIP bell curve. But who knows which one is trustworthy. Now, I just look up restro reviews at 2 places - Zomato, Google. If you order from Swiggy, do cross check the restro rating with Zomato, Google reviews.Here are few other examples -Swiggy is too enthusiastic to give great ratingsSwiggy’s #votes for any known or unknown restaurant are always above 1000. In the 2nd case below it is 10K votes! I doubt its credibility. Seems like they are into votes/reviews buying business also.It reminded me of that malpractices expose I read few years ago and how true it is.Swiggy ramps up ratings of its restaurants to get more orders, tampers with honest reviewsand I couldnt have been more disgusted at this. No business is completely honest, I understand that, but you can’t be dishonest with the core offering you have, what is left to con then. It seems like other things the company is accused of is also true.Which idiot cons publicly anyways, Swiggy tampers with ratings as if those restros aren’t rated on Zomato or Google, how stupid of them. This reminds me - conning is an art in itself, not everyone can do it."

They even provided notifications as to when the delivery guy got dispatched and subsequently his position kept dynamically updating on a kind of google map interface.Even the service time was really fast and I was delivered the food within around 20 minutes.Also I think McDonald’s Packaging deserves a special mention. I am yet to see other food chains deliver food in such a well packaged manner.With the onset of various cashback offers from various mobile wallets such as PayTM and Freecharge, I’m looking forward to ordering more and more from Swiggy !"

Once he hung up, I noticed that the order had been cancelled. I also checked my phone records and saw that I hadn’t received a single call from the delivery personI immediately got in touch with the Swiggy customer support, who claimed that they had called me several times and had left an SMS on my phone, to which I apparently hadn’t replied. I checked my SMS record, and found nothing. Then, they claimed that they delivery person had been sitting in front of my apartment complex for 20 mins, waiting for me to receive the call, when in fact, if he had difficulty with the directions, he could have easily asked one of the few pedestrians passing by.Now, here’s the kicker. My apartment complex faces the front gate of our complex, so I could easily have seen had the delivery person indeed been there. Even if I wasn’t present, the security guard would have alerted me. Neither did I see the person, nor did the security guard alert me, which definitely means the delivery person wasn’t there.Swiggy’s cancellation policy states that they will charge a 100% cancellation fee, i.e. they won’t refund the money. The customer service, being ever so “generous”, decided to refund 50% of the amount after I said I wouldn’t order using their service anymore. I argued, saying that I don’t have a record of them calling or sending an SMS, but they wouldn’t budge. It seems to me like there is some sort of a racket going on, to which I might have fallen victim.This isn’t my first time having an issue with Swiggy, but definitely the last. I don’t think I’ll be using them to order food anymore. Their utter unprofessionalism and a very ridiculous cancellation policy allowed them to get away with something that wasn’t my fault."

"Just had my worst experience ever!So I ordered my food at 9:12pm and the order was supposed to deliver in 30 minutes. And in 5 minutes it shows that my order will be delivered in 26 minutes. But after a while it started showing that it'll take 28 minutes. Then the time went by and it was 9:45. I reached out to customer service. They haven't replied for a good 10 minutes. Then theybreply with “ Please wait while we check the issue “ And go for another 5 minutes. Then they inform me that the delivery guy will be there in 5 minutes. Which they continues to tell for 20 minutes. So when the deliverContinue ReadingJust had my worst experience ever!So I ordered my food at 9:12pm and the order was supposed to deliver in 30 minutes.

Then they inform me that the delivery guy will be there in 5 minutes. Which they continues to tell for 20 minutes. So when the delivery guy reaches the house he asks me to talk to a random person on the street to tell them the address. ( I hated this so much) I insist that I will go down my apartment and get the food anyway but he makes me speak to some stranger. Then after I go down and get my food, I pay him ( my oder was cash on delivery) . He didn't have any upi payment apps so I had to pay him cash. But unfortunately I didn't have change and he should give me 20 rupees. So he pulls out a 50 rupee note and demands me to give 30 change. As I didn't carry any change on me, I was perplexed. He then proceeds to ask a random uncle passing by for change. And to my bad luck that uncle knows me and he offers me to pay that amount and I pay back to him ( which, again, I don't like, as I hate to be in debt to anyone) . With no choice left I ask the delivery guy to wait, I go back up to my home , bring the change and give to the delivery guy.So now that I finally have my food, I wanted to eat. It was 10:30 already. So I open my packet and I see my delivered food was entirely the wrong order. I reach out to customer service again and they offer to re order, instead I asked for a compensation and theh didn't want to send money on cashback so they gave me a coupon, which I used to order again ( As the order I received was non veg and I am vegan) .So now I order again and from a different place which has a delivery time of 15 min. Fast and simple. Easy isn't it? I ordered at 10:37.But again.. The order was delated and in the mean time I try the customer service again. As expected they didn't reply again. They replied at 11:20 and all they said was we will look into it.I received my food at 11:53. So while I take my order I get a call from customer service guy and he tells me thag he is extremely sorry and he will highlight this matter very much and offer me another 50 rupee coupon. I refused and asked for a cashback. He said “ Due to limitations we can't do that “ . I was so mad I said “ You have your limitations we have our irritations. I've been at it for a good 2 hours . I am very dissatisfied with the servies“ and he hangs up. He gives me the coupon anyway and that's it.This wasn't the first time I got a wrong order or my order was delayed. It happend multiple times I can't even count .What a wonderful experience I had. Never using the app again. Came here right after uninstalling the app.This app all good up until they started doing the instamart and the genie and the meat delivery thingy. The charges have increased too.They are talking up more than they can handle and are spoiling they image and service."

"So here's an account of a recent experience with Swiggy. Please note that this is not meant to be a hate message against Swiggy but just a personal account of the Indian Food Delivery startup. Personally I see a lot of value in food delivery servies which I use a lot in the US. Being an enthusiast, I recommended and encouraged my parents to use the service. Sure enough this would save them a lot of hassle, especially when they are sick or when there is bad weather.Now my dad then used their service, and for the very first time his order of a meals missed rice and only the sides (sambar,rasam)Continue ReadingSo here's an account of a recent experience with Swiggy. Please note that this is not meant to be a hate message against Swiggy but just a personal account of the Indian Food Delivery startup. Personally I see a lot of value in food delivery servies which I use a lot in the US. Being an enthusiast, I recommended and encouraged my parents to use the service. Sure enough this would save them a lot of hassle, especially when they are sick or when there is bad weather.Now my dad then used their service, and for the very first time his order of a meals missed rice and only the sides (sambar,rasam) were delivered. Upon raising this concern to the delivery person, he was lethargic and didn't seem to care, neither did the restaurant. Since the payment was already done online through credit card, their attitudes seemed like it is now my dad's problem to handle.Ok, so the natural next step is to raise this issue through the Swiggy app. However, there was no response, and hence the only way is to message Swiggy's profile. Upon which following conversation happened, where the Swiggy service person is willing to refund only Rs. 100 whereas the food itself was worth more.*Now here's my take on the incident, It seems like the Indian startup works on the policy, ""Be happy with what you get!"" which is clearly not the way a company provides service to its customers or works. While the lost order amount doesn't concern me, the very lethargic attitude of the company towards customers and its poor quality service deeply saddens me. While I use their western world counterpart Uber Eats, where such incidents have happened. Uber eats has always managed to address the situation in a right and prompt manner. Upon talking to a couple of other friends, it seems like this is a persistent issue with Swiggy (atleast in the Chennai area). Why is there such a difference? Why is the Indian food startup not incentivized to provide quality service? Why does that startup assume that it is the responsiblity of the individual to get their once they have provided their credit card info? Isn't that what looting is, but the company is now doing it through technology?*I know some of you work in Swiggy in some capacity, and some of them in similar Indian startups, please be aware of these. Hoping some of you will soon take up important roles in these companies, I hope you guys will keep in mind that it is important to provide good quality services to the customer."

Tell me one thing that it’s a ready made cloth shop that this design is not available? They are F*****G restaurant and they make food. When I called customer care, he told me the same and instead, I can not understand him.What do you think of Swiggy? Complete crap. Never use it. Never. You can die by hunger but not with frustration and anger.Edit: On 26th November, 2017 - They don't even reply to your messages. Only a call would come when you mention a name “consumer court”. Seriously, people you should go and eat some place instead of cursing them with hungry stomach. I am doing that."

"They are pathetic, the delivery takes forever, and even their delivery executive are illiterate, rude and indecent! I think while expanding they have forgotten that they also need to hire trained delivery executive, not some idiot who just don’t know how to locate location and how to talk to the customer.In case this continues they will soon be next list of startups shutdown!"
"Bhangi hain BC!Surcharge- additional 25 rupees in rainy seasonZomato and Food Panda don’t do this.Delivery chargeof 30 rupees - something that zomato doesn’t charge for most restaurants.Delivery Time!! -2 hours to deliver in a range of 2 kms!!!Mar jate kya to raste me pata nahi.Additional Charges- Compare same orders between zomato and swiggy, you’ll always find swiggy charging 25–50 rupees more than zomato/foodpanda.Increased prices -Swiggyhas higher prices for most dishes as against the original (lower) prices of restaurants. You can compare a few Menus to find the truth."
"Swiggy is terrible..!!!i tried to order food from swiggy with a coupon of 60% offer, and when i clicked the confirm button, the money was shown without coupon deduction. i cancelled it soon and then they are asking for 115rs for cancellation after ordering.no food and need to pay moneystay away from stupid Swiggy!!!"

"I have been talking about this from so long to all the people around me and was waiting to share my experience with a large audience so that this would surely help each one of us.It happened to be a soothing weekend after a long tiring week of work. We cousins had gathered at a commonplace having a gala time. Suddenly, Kaju Katli hit my mind and I just started craving for it like crazy.Within no time, I made the same announcement among all.

We cousins had gathered at a commonplace having a gala time. Suddenly, Kaju Katli hit my mind and I just started craving for it like crazy.Within no time, I made the same announcement among all. Owning a mobile, I ordered Kaju Katli onSwiggyon one of my cousin's phone since the price of the same item was shown comparatively lesser on his phone. Ordering food on Swiggy is seemingly hassle-free. I had made anonline payment(bold because I want to advise people to order food via cash on delivery alone).For those who have not understood the reason for adding the extra piece of information in brackets:As everyone does, I started tracking of food delivery on the app. Waited for it almost an hour. Then, when I could see the food only 2 minutes away from me, I asked my cousin to run down the stairs (We were on the 1st floor) and get the food.To my dismay, when he returned back, he told that the delivery boy told the food has been delivered already.Imagine waiting for an hour for your food for which you have already paid and no returns from it? I completely turned red then and took his phone. Called back the delivery boy and belted him down. He pleaded for forgiving him since this would, in turn, take away his bread and butter. I had no option but to hang up.After that, I tried reaching the Swiggy support but they said that they could not be of any help since the delivery boy claimed that it has been delivered.Who was at mistake then?I wish I could reach out to the person who with no shame accepted food not paid by him.Anyways, with no intention of causing harm to anyone, I want to suggest people ordering food from Swiggy to make cash on delivery payment method alone.Also, Swiggy ( I wish I could add #Swiggy_official here) do add a feature of OTP for confirmation from the right person.And to the person who ate my food, I do not know what situation you were in, do not repeat this.Order Number: #26233924964"
"★★★Just putting my fear here. Do you make sure that the food is from the incorrect shop that is mentioned on the cover.My fear is, maybe the staff, somewhere down the line, has a pack full of empty delivery covers of various shop, then when you order they just buy from some 'chingu-mungu ka dhabba' and put in the cover and send it to you.Think.. think.. its possible. Anyways thanks for your replies, wont buy from swiggys the thuggys"

"My 6 months experience with Swiggy:1) No calling system for immediate issues.2) Chat system is useless.

Swiggy manager call then.6) Ask refund to original payment mode as Swiggy coupons are misleading. Suppose you get 75 Rs. refund in coupon form and you applied this coupon on any order worth Rs.120 and if this food fails to live up your expectation you could get 45 Rs. refund not remaining 75 Rs. as you have already used this coupon. Ideally and basically it’s your 75 Rs.7) Instructions only taken as formality.8) Human assistant gives BOT reply.9) Check invoice carefully everytime.10) Swiggy would not agree easily on your images and foods cannot be distinguished through images for instance Mango lassi and Aamras. It can only judged by taste. So insist for video recording to substantiate.You must be lucky if everything happens smoothly in one stroke else you would be the most unlucky person in the world.Wish you all the best !!!"

We asked him the correct reason & still he was lying & he had guts to call tricky food in front of us later he confessed his mistake. On the contrary I called swiggy customer care & recited him whole story than he kept us on hold & to pamper us he said swiggy can give 100rs coupon wherein my husband said we will give 500.. service of swiggy is still worst. We got lunch in evening & we did not accept the order. Durga wrote that delivery is done & no refund was initiated from swiggy"

I told them i need a refund now, so i can place my next order, and they straight away said they will not so that, as it takes 5 days for refund. I dont understand if it concerns them, that i wasted whole 1.5 hours in this struggle while my daughter was hungry as hell and they had no courtesy to atleast provide a replacement of same / similar order when ot was their fucking fault."
They don't deliver on time and they are not bothered to inform..food why we order it's for hunger but they say the time of delivery but they don't deliver if ask they make us to wait for double more time and if we ask they will say to cancel the order.bledy waisted time ordering in swiggy..very very wrost as the company grow and made name…

I made an order on 26 March. But due to some address problem their boy wasn't able to reach to my location.

That way I should not be incurring a lot of packaging charges either, which will only increase transactions on your app / website and help save the restaurants operating costs as well. In fact, have users locked in to this greener alternative by default and we can CHOOSE if we want anything.Ideally you should be rewarding customers with some loyalty points or at least a small discount for choosing the eco-friendlier option. Do your employees' kids a huge favor and care about this rather than some marketing memes.”"
"Very bad experience, the food delivered is from some local road side vendor, its cheating."
"In Pune, Swiggy rules the roost. There may have been blunders now and then, but they’ve refunded my money when that happened. Agreed, I probably don’t order often enough, but I’ve used Zomato, Swiggy and Foodpanda, and I have had some horror stories with Zomato. Foodpanda is OK. Swiggy works just fine for me."
I tried Swiggy for the first time. They didn't bother to tell me that delivery person is not willing to deliver for almost an hour. They refunded the money after that. I stay in the heart of the city. I didn’t understand the logic. But for sure this is not a service you need to depend on when you are hungry. Will never try it again.
"it is horrible. never try it. thy deliver wrong food items, take too much of time, their staff is not helpful and if you cancel an order you won't get your money back even if you cancel the order. I have order twice , once there was only half tub of ice cream filled, the other time guy took 3 hours to deliver and order was all wrong. Never try it. it's horrible."
"★Worst service ever!! In spite of heavy competition, Swiggy dont even bother about customer money and time. They just play around with customer precious time and hard money.Swiggy always have bug in thier app and technical issues are daily routine. Customer support is No Way!!! Worst then any other business in this world.I strongly recommend all existing as well as new users, not to use Swiggy since they can block your money anytime and make you poor.

"Swiggy’s delivery agents exhibit unprofessional and rude behavior, repeatedly calling customers unnecessarily despite having the correct location. The customer care service is equally disappointing—agents fail to communicate effectively, behave rudely, and even disconnect calls abruptly. To make matters worse, the food was delivered in an unsealed plastic bag with no protection, leaving it vulnerable to tampering. How can customers trust that the food is genuine or hasn’t been tampered with?

"I had an extremely disappointing experience with Swiggy. I ordered 10 samosas with a promised delivery time of 20-25 minutes. The food was delivered after 1 hour, which was frustrating but just the beginning of the ordeal. Upon unpacking, I found the samosas were uncooked, stale, and had a white layer on top, a clear indication of expired food.When I raised a complaint and requested a refund for my ₹270 payment, I was shocked to learn that only ₹38 would be refunded.

Despite my protest, the amount was credited without my consent, and I was told to email their support team as it’s the “maximum their system allows.”The customer support executive was clueless and ineffective, seemingly reading from a script. After wasting 6 minutes, I requested to speak with a manager, who turned out to be equally unhelpful. Their response? Feedback will be shared with the restaurant, and ₹38 is all they can do. I even suggested a replacement or alternative resolution, but they were rigid and unwilling to assist.Adding to the frustration, Swiggy’s email support is notoriously bad. I’ve faced issues in the past where emails went unanswered, and the same pattern continues. It feels like Swiggy is fooling customers and engaging in fraudulent practices.This experience has left me furious and disheartened. I urge others to think twice before ordering from Swiggy, as their service and support are not worth your time or money.I’m done with food delivery apps altogether. This experience has shown me how unreliable and frustrating they can be. I’ll now rely on local restaurants and direct takeaways—at least there, I know what I’m paying for."

"The price of food items are double when ordered on swiggy. Even after paying a huge price the quantity of food is not enough to fill the stomach.

I ordered for one of my relative in Varthur Whitefield but delivery boy said that he is standing near Whitefield bus stop and denied delivery at right place even customer care is also not supportive and cancelled order from their side with zero refund..my order I'd was #190127564825175.This was truly disgusting and disappointing as well . swiggy is fooling it's customer and breaking their trust and that too for the sake of money.

Drunken and drugs using delivery boys in Chenganoor.Even customer care complaint registered but no body responds tru mail or mobile.its a worthy company don't make any orders in swiggy especially family people.Batchelors it's ok.If you are family oriented don't order any thing inswiggy.itwill make problem to you so please…don't order
Swiggy is best service provider in the industry and it is improving everyday and it delivers the food very quickly plus there process is smooth and hassle free they are also providing a good number of discount and gift coupons
I really don't understand how swiggy works if anyone knows do let know. For example I want one item why it cost too much in total bill. And even no coupons available.Continue ReadingI really don't understand how swiggy works if anyone knows do let know. For example I want one item why it cost too much in total bill.

I am boycotting swiggy. Swiggy is a no 1 Thief in broad daylight. There is a very huge difference in the price displayed in Swiggy App and in the actual restaurant's original menu. Shameless thieves. How can you spike the price of the dish and charge for your service on top of it. You make a profit of more than 50% on the food that you are only delivering and cooking it yourself. What values are you all made of ??? You make money by cheating your customers when they order food. Cheapos.
Swiggy is least bother about customers. If the ordered food is undelivered even after One and half hour of placing order. They didn't even take any action against the restaurant or delivery boy.I ordered food for my son residing in kota. Swiggy failed to deliver food and I had to cancelled my order. It was so late that my son slept hungry.Very bad experience 😞

"I like the fact that swiggy gives Gold membership for less price, also delivery is really quick and fast, delivery agents are also polite, the customer support is very helpful. Whenever the food delivered had spilled i used to call the customer support and raise a complaint and they used to thourougly investigate it and issue refund which was very nice. I use the swiggy service very frequently. Swiggy is easy to use aswell. And it is easy to implement. Also, there are features like food delivery, dine in, etc. This is really good. It is easy to integrate."
"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction and frustration regarding my recent order (Order ID #163928872555697 ) through Swiggy from the Lio' Pizza restaurant.Today, I ordered white sauce pasta, but to my dismay, the delivery partner handed me a small packet of French fries with subpar packaging.

The situation was further aggravated when I noticed that the bill was missing, and there were no visible Swiggy tags or marks on the packaging, making it seem like a purchase from a local street shop.I immediately complained on in-app chat, seeking assistance, but the responses received were unsatisfactory, with messages indicating a delayed resolution time of 7-8 hours even after trying 2–3 times. This is not acceptable, especially considering I was left hungry without a proper meal.Moreover, this incident is not isolated. I have faced consistent issues with late deliveries, despite the promised 20-30 minute delivery time. Even after 30 mins your app shows the same expected delivery time then after 1 hour of delivering the order and shows ""Congratulations delivery partner reached before time and saved your time"", is this a joke to you guys? Each time I raise concerns, the response is a mere apology.Given these persistent inconveniences, I am demanding an immediate refund for the incorrect order delivered and compensation for the time wasted and mental stress endured.As a content strategist myself, I understand the importance of delivering quality service to customers. Unfortunately, my experience with Swiggy has been far from satisfactory, and I believe they must address these issues promptly.In light of these recurring problems with both time management and order accuracy, I am sharing this incident on Quora and have decided to uninstall the Swiggy app today.For this packaging they charged an extra 10/- and an additional platform fee……what is your opinion guys?"
I have been using the swiggy food delivery service for the past few years and by far one of the worst service delivery guys. Their customer service executives doesn't understand what customer is speaking and ask irrelevant questions. May be the backend systems and rules formed may be bad and customer services executives are also not sure of rules of service.

Since then I have been following up with Swiggy and today they sent a mail stating that the can’t do anything and offered me coupon worth Rs. 66. It is a joke I think and the company is run by bunch of Jokers. I don’t know what to do and who to approach because they are a big company but indulged in sheer cheating the consumer. You can’t trust them anymore because once the money is paid you may not receive any food.Another instances with them, I booked for genie to pick up some sweets for my friend and deliver to his address. The delivery guys refused to pick up the sweets and Swiggy deducted hefty fine and refunded few Rs. Being a Non Resident I could not do anything but had to forfeit the money for the sweets as well as Swiggy fees.I am done with them for good but advising others to think twice before using their service anymore. Do you want to make a cheat richer?"

"I recently had a terrible experience with Swiggy. I placed an order and was unable to pick it up due to some issues, and since it was a prepaid order, I had to cancel it. To my horror, Swiggy charged me the full amount of the order as a cancellation fee, even though I had no way to pick up the order. This is a complete scam, and I would encourage everyone to stay away from Swiggy. Their customer service is non-existent, and they have no respect for customer rights. Stay away from this fraud company."
"One of the worst company, you order for lunch and you get delivered at dinner and if you will not able to take order they refund your payment and your are hopeless for your carving"
"Swiggy is the worst app I have ever used , they are the cheaters and the delivery partners and customer service is worstThey were unable to deliver my order and later on when it came to moment of cancellation, they cancelled my order and later on they didn't refund my amount and charged cancellation fee as same as I have paid for the orderIt's really disgusting app i ever felt,, I have ordered from so many apps but this is really worst"
Swiggy has a hand in glove module between the supply chain band support staff to swindle money. They have a clear cut plan to cancel order from their end and claim it was cancelled from the user end and swindle the deposited money. Any amount of proof or explanation is not entertained so kindly order by COD only or best use other bussiness ethical apps like zomato
I order the food at 11:45 and it was 1:30 am and I didn’t got my order. Such horrible service they give also when I complaint about it they weren’t responding and only said wait your order will reach. Guys if you want your order on time then never order from this app!!BEWARE of this app you’re gonna loose a lot of time!!
"Horrible . If there is leakage of food or items are missing from the order they turn a deaf ear to you . They need proof of missing items !!!! Their delivery guys threaten us to not complain about them . Even after raising concerns on their chat , email and call queue we are told they cannot help or even refund money for missing items . It’s like a mafia , steal our food , charge us and then ask us to prove it !! What a shame !"
There are also lot of people who tries to cheat swiggy.Taking orders and also taking refunds from swiggy.

I demanded to be put through to their ‘manager’ and Mohan advised the same about no refund. He then relented and said we would receive a refund of only Rs700. I threatened to report Swiggy to the local police for fraud. After almost an hour they finally agreed to refund me in full.This is the second incident in 2 weeks - the first was with my order for Chayoos where they failed to deliver 3 portions of food and still charged me in full. Still not received any refund……apology is far from it. Do not use.Use Zomato instead.
"According to me, Swiggy has always been my go-to option when it comes to ordering food online. In this competitive environment, I believe Swiggy costs a bit less in terms of Zomato.

The bloody deliver partner did not answer the call and we were waiting for our order since 54 mins. Kids at home had slept off waiting for order and food was not cooked at home. The response from customer care of swiggy was shit. They did not even try to contact the restaurant for an alternative solution. Here the problem is not with the money but the hunger. Worst application ever.
"It sucks.The starting step to use Swiggy is to create an account. And here itself the company falters. The website needs mobile phone number instead of email address to create account. What stupid logic is this?Multiple people can use same mobile number (because mobile phone is used as landline now in many houses), so they cannot create separate accounts?When developing a website, the analysts should have some common sense.

Swiggy is not at all worth it. I has really bad experiences with these guys. I ordered stuff worth 700 and the delivery boy took it and I was like what the hell and the customer care is useless. They'll not help at all. Zomato is 100x better

I just wanted to recommend everyone try swiggy because it gives fast delivery as well as they have the connections with best restaurant who provides the delicious food.https://www.consumervoiceindia.com/places/swiggy/

But i could have still used their services. However, something which changed above was their customer service and issue resolution.Today i was at my mom's place in Delhi and i had to come back to my inlaws place in Delhi itself. I ordered Ghewar ( a traditional sweet of north india gifted by parents to married daughters in monsoons). I took the ppackage and served and realised then it was burned food. Now what option i was left with. I contacted their customer service as it was bad food delivered which was cause of immense embarrassment at my in laws place.If you are from Delhi you can understand my plight as i ordered package from Evergreen food chain in Delhi. It was fault of Evergreen in first place . I wxpected Swiggy to give me full refund and charge Evergreen for the mental pain i took. This way i could have ordered sweet again from another outlet to cover up embarrassment.After wasting more than half an hour on their customer service they reached at refund of 400 from 200 offered initially. This was just 2/3rd of package price excluding delivery charges and the tip i paid in cash. Or they offered to deliver replacement package at my mom's place from where it was ordered. Am i supposed go back again 20 kms to collect the package. I denied both the options and swiggy closed the call. .I wish Swiggy would not have been so shameless and may have used their own genie services to get the verified replacement package at my in laws place. I felt littled as consumer of their services , anguished , cheated both by a brand like Evergreen Green Park and by Swiggy. They washed off my happiness and emotions with which my parents gifted me this festive sweets."
"Very bad Service,I placed 2 orders both get delayed, I called both the restaurants, they said that they are waiting with more than 30 Swiggy orders, but no one reaching them to collect, worst part is that , they mentioning that there is raining, but it is absolutely incorrect information."

(They didn’t let me cancel the order free of cost)I am someone who places 50+ orders a month easily via the app. But guess it’s time to log off this application, cause if they don’t care for me. They definitely don’t care for someone who orders lesser."
Very very bad experience I ordered for ballabhgarh and erroneously I have put gali no 4 instead of 5 so delivery boy did not deliver and I loss apprx 500 rs as swiggy cancel. My order and swiggy boy told me I will deliver after confirmation of customer care also his manger has not skill to talk with customer he told me jo krna h kr lo nhi hoga deliver nd we will.make u loss so very very bad experience good direct order from pizza hut or dominoz
"Swiggy is worst , please dont use it even you feel dying bcoz of starving trust me , until and unless you are 100% sure about restaurant food quality order it else leave it."
I am from Delhi and I ordered something on swiggy for which they have deducted the money for 6 times and and did not refund my money I thought I should wait for few days so that maybe they will process my refund but they did not do that so I chat in the Swiggy help section and they did not solved my problem and didn't accept that they have deducted my money 6 times for just one order. I am very disappointed with my experience with swiggy order and this is not the first time that I have refund problem in swiggy I have already faced few times when they deduct the money but did not placed my ordeContinue ReadingI am from Delhi and I ordered something on swiggy for which they have deducted the money for 6 times and and did not refund my money I thought I should wait for few days so that maybe they will process my refund but they did not do that so I chat in the Swiggy help section and they did not solved my problem and didn't accept that they have deducted my money 6 times for just one order.

"Third time that the delivery guy has vanished with our food, after we have paid by card and waited over an hour, hungry and tired. Swiggy is the worst app in the history of food delivery, with zero quality control over its delivery boys, abysmal standards of manpower, hiring cheap labour with no verification and absolutely no safeguards or mechanisms of ensuring delivery. They have no shame for this incredible lack of business ethics, not even offering full compensation despite repeated incidents. This is the last time we order from Swiggy, and we will make sure we write this review everywhereContinue ReadingThird time that the delivery guy has vanished with our food, after we have paid by card and waited over an hour, hungry and tired.

"Very bad service. First of all the prices on their app/website is considerably higher than the restaurant. Secondly the portion of food you get is way less than what you would feed a baby. For example, I ordered Honey chicken and only received 7 small pieces which I finished in under a minute.Solution - Only Buy from reputed restaurants by going directly on their website such as KFC, Dominos etc. You’ll get better offers there and they do not charge packaging fees after a certain amount and do not scam on bad weather conditions surcharges or inflated taxes.STAY AWAY FROM SWIGGY !!!"
"Never again will i use this app! their refunds take 7 days even if mistake is fully on them.Unpardonable experience this time...i had ordered a birthday cake for a friend living in a different part of the country. After paying and giving the address clearly,even after delivery person reached the correct venue,they cancelled the order with 100%fee, despite instruction from receiving end to leave it with security due to non contact delivery. Fraudulent company! Wouldnt recommend anyone to use!!"
"2 days back i had placed an order through swiggy on cart, i received a call from there end stating 2 items are not availability,i said ok send remaing when delivery agent came to drop the veggies he said one product was not available u will get a refund,when i contacted swiggy they are saying they wont be able to give the refund for the missing items..really bad experience i have paid for something which i never received there customer service is worst...they are ripp off and fooling ppp around and making money .pls dont buy anything from swiggy chor company"

"Swiggy is using unfair means to recover money during lockdown. Applying cancellation charge for 244 and above, merely 50% of your order value. Made online payment compulsory to do this unethical activities.They will ask for location track along with full address then too the executive will not reach you and if by chance you miss one call they will apply 244rs of cancellation charge on order value of 498. they have plan to loot people and blame them for incorrect location.Delivery executives are trained to be rude and misbehave on call.Incident with me on 6jun2020, Delivery boy was not able toContinue ReadingSwiggy is using unfair means to recover money during lockdown.

SWIGGy is also manipulating customer rating. I recently rated a particular hotel a low rating with some comments. Turns out the rating was changed to higher one and the comments were missing.
"Im installing their app just to give poor rating. See how much frustrating they are. I think same might be the case with zomato, will check them later.U write anything anywhere , swiggy dont read that .

"Not worth your money. Do not spend any money here. You are lucky if you get good food; but even if you are a regular customer of Swiggy, they will pay least attention to your concern when you get bad food.This has been the case with me multiple times, and I am permanently deleting this application from my phone.All the best to all the Swiggy customers !You will be cheated soon by Swiggy."
"I ordered desserts from swiggy, choco lava and walnut cake . After waiting for 1 hour food was received. Food was stale and cold, I asked for refund and they started making excuses. Their service is soooooo bakwasss. They run business to loot people. Highly disappointed."
Some of the major fraud that Swiggy does is that on the app they will show discounted price just to fool the customers. Today i ordered milk from swiggy store which was showing on discounted price ( Full cream milk of Amul at Rs. 58) so i went ahead and ordered 14 cartons as it was on discounted price and i paid Rs. 779 online. When the delivery guy came he gave me a bill of Rs.894 and asked me to pay an additional of Rs. 140 on asking the reason the guy said that the milk was sold for original price.My point is when you are selling things on MRP then why do you fool customers by showing thatContinue ReadingSome of the major fraud that Swiggy does is that on the app they will show discounted price just to fool the customers.

THEY ARE A BIG TIME FRAUD and you can clearly see that everytime you make a purchase they show that they are giving an offer but in actual you are paying the full price.I am also attaching the bills: Rs. 779 that i paid online for the purchaseAnd the bill that the delivery guy gave me of Rs. 894 ( the actual price that i had to pay)Boycott swiggy..use ZOMATO they are much better and they are honest with the discounts unlike swiggy that kind of manipulates customer in looting the money.
"Swiggy is just the worst food delivery app.. The only thing more “worse” (not a word but juat understand the emotion) than that is their pathetic pathetic customer service.. Just so irritating and not at all friendly.I placed an order and the time was shown something and delivery did happen few minutes late, that's highly ok but what’s not ok is their covering up of this by extending their 1min to atleast 10 mins..

Tere fufa ke liye..!@swiggy_in @SwiggyCares no swiggy doesn't care 😂😂Attached is the email screenshot of their cold shoulder response in which they absolutely gave no solution. Also note, first we need to patiently CHAT with their customer service executive, they will say the same thing and next they will suggest to send an email, because thers nothing that they can do.Let me remind you all this is happening while I, as a custome, am super hungry, have wrong food delivered on the table, non sensitive non sensible customer service.I passed on the food to someone else but swiggy you have lost me!"

This time I was loud and told him to hand up immediately. I didn't take any replacement because I was fed up.I am not sure if they are badly trained, callous or just overloaded with work but this is not the first time I have found an incompetent customer care person..........it happens everytime and sometimes they to force us the cancel the orders as well as a means of closing the ticket early. This is the first time I am adding a review on Quora about any company at all, that's how angry I am.#SWIGGY #CUSTOMERSERVICE just sucks."
"Fraud by delivery boy!I ordered food for Rs 986 from Swiggy and the delivery boy cancelled the order saying the address given by me was wrong, which was a complete lie and when i contacted the customer care they were not willing to share his details and all they could do was give me a coupon.I am talking as a user who not only uses swiggy but also other other food apps and this is the first time i encountered something worst like this.Atleast have the decency to get these scoundrels out of service. Completely dissatisfied with the service. Waste of money and time.#No more Swiggy"

Swiggy is worst in Services and infact doing online frauds now..They are damm frauds. They himself cancel the order and charge cancellation from Customer. Already sent mail and chat but no use.Zomato is better in services…
Zomato is much better than Swiggy….. Swiggy rips off many customers with over the top prices with stupid discounts and malpractices in orders…. One day I ordered a Coke with French fries.. But i received half bottle of coke… Wtfff
"Your order will take hours to deliver and once u report on customer service, they ll suggest u to cancel the order and replace it 😂😂 this way I had to cancel and replace two orders since 2 pm and now it's 5.30 pm, thanks for the wonderful lunch Swiggy :) just uninstalled ur useless app and services"
Very very fake app .. no security on app .. sombody hack my swiggy account .. I complemented in swiggy customer care .. but they are not helping me..please don't use swiggy app ..please guys take this information on serious note ..
What a disgusting and pathetic experience. Highly unprofessional and disgusting service. If you cant deliver food you should not take any orders. Your delivery executives are useless and fools. Extremely irresponsible conduct by swiggy and you deserve to shut down if you cany render proper service to your customers. Shameful.Swiggy should be sued for rendering such deficient services and causing trouble to the customers. In addition they are unapologetic and there is no one who responds to the customer grievances.

"Swiggy is the only service I know so far is ready to compromise the food packing and quality without any guilt.If you raise a concern to them, you will just get to hear sorry without getting any resolution."
"I had a bad experience with swiggy service .refund not done from past 2 months no proper response from the team and only way you can communicate with swiggy is via chat they don't have contact no.I have been enquiring my refund amount of around 1000 rs .they are not refunding ,first time when I asked they told in or 2 days now 5 working days to transfer and also they told they will transfer to phonepe account.they suppose to transfer to my account. I totally desperated with swiggy service and they had cancelled after ordering 3 hours later"
"Aweful ordering Aap. Money got deducted from account but order not showing up. After repeated requests, they. Told money will be refunded. Later when that timeline passed, she refused to refund or even listen to my query."
"above all coupons and fast deliveries. here is the catch….all items u select from the menu, are provided in quarter portion while price they quote is of half, so discount is their with the discounted quantity…….for swiggy and zomato dont be surprise if you get less quantity with the discounted price.I am regularly ordering from my favourite restaurant directly and realised the difference.Nobody is going to pay from your pocket, neither restaurant nor swiggy or zomato…. cheers !"

Swiggy is fake company my friend join to. Swiggy last week they earn something 1200 and swiggy cut the 750 rupees and say customer complaints that's wise cut the money but who complain this not show and reason of food is missing and extra so swiggy why not say hotal missing in food and his cut money to poor man majbur jo hai jo mehant karke kamate hai petrol weste karte hai or ye log needy insaan ke sath aisa karte hai cheet company and fake pepole
Not only malpractices but also rude customer care folks. Today is my last fu_#$ day with these buggers.

I would prefer Foodpanda and Uber eats over swiggy"
"Hi, I ordered from Swiggy ( restaurant name The Kebab Tales - item name Bhatti da Murg). The food was stale and rotten. Just to give discounts orders from Swiggy are very bad quality. Don't use Swiggy. Order directly."
"It is about Food..So in this business trust is most essential.But I think swiggy have not understood this.I have lost all of my trust after ordering 5–6 times in Swiggy ( I will not write in detail. In short, it is about missing items poor quality of food and poor customer support)And I will never use any App for order of food. Food is a very serious issue."
"My experience with Swiggy.So, I ordered something and the address was entered incorrectly by me. It was 5Km away from my delivery point. At the very same moment, I called the delivery guy and requested him to deliver since both entered and the delivery place were at the same distance from the restaurant.

But think about how many they would've made just because of customer's sheer negligence."
"Worst training of delivery person, they speak in rough tone . Very rare to see soft spoken people, either train them properly or else dont recruit such people."
Worst experience… delivery person used vulgar words for asking why late for delivery… the best gift for me choosing swiggy… the biggest mistake I have done in my life time is that I used swiggy to order food and I was punished by delivery person for committing the mistake….
"I just used Swiggy today, and the experience was awesome, just awesome! Five  as rating. I don't think they expect you to tip the delivery executive, and I didn't. Both Swiggy and Zomato have just opened recently in Belgaum. I haven't tried Zomato yet. I prefer the Swiggy website.I couldn't imagine the service that I got from Swiggy. Way to go!"
Very poor performance . We have ordered the food after going through the availabilitY.within few mins. They cancel our order
"Never order food from restaurants which are located far away , especially in traffic times , the food would more or less be cold and lose its hot energy altogether."

"Their procedure is very unclear. I don’t know about the organization as a whole or how its operating procedure is but the Swiggy guy just stood at the ground floor of our apartment, waited for “twenty minutes” and went away. He didn’t ring the door bell or even give a call. The times we called him he said he was coming soon or his phone would be switched off.:("

This was not it, when I spoke to the Customer service representative they just said they'll take the feedback but no replacement or refund.What kind of service is this?How would I benefit by just passing the feedback?"
Sach a bad experience…i hv 4 month old daughter…earlier also when ever I order they never deliver food on time nd today can't explain…i was waiting from last 1 hour 10 mints nd now I received a call nd person said it will take another 45 MIN….PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR TIMING…REALLY I M NEVER GOING TO ORDER FROM YOU SWIGGY….deleted app also
I ordered through Swiggy today. The restaurant confirmed the order but there was no delivery for over 1 and a half hours. Exhausted I called up swiggy. I thought that will help in getting the order immediatelyBut the person simply cancels the order and says refund will reach me in 4 days time. I then had to start searching for food at 4pm instead of 2pm.I have realized never to fully rely on swiggy again.
"Horrible…… I ordered at pune. It was 2 plates of idli for myself. From wadeshwar. Even after 2hours, all the contact were nullified saying that the server was down. How come the server could charges me cancellation charges of 75/-. The idles were ordered from outside Becoz I was down with flu. And couldn't manage to cook. And here it is.. The service is very bad. NEVER TRY SWIGGY"
Bad food.. pathetic foodFood with insects and super bad delivery is what swiggy gives u and then empty promises of refund
SUPER PATHETIC SERVICENOT ONCE BUT EVERY TIMEIT has been quite frequently times that once order is placed on swiggy one or the other problems exists with their delivery boys. Like sometimes boys are new or order doesn't reach to the restaurant on time and thein N number of excuses to be Soo late that one doesn't feel to receive the order onlyKindly don't use this app if u want to save your time try other apps like zomato

"hi all, i ordered first time from swiggy. food price was same as resto menu. order was rs. 250 and they added rs. 10 for delivery. which is fair. but more surprising was the quantity of food. its almost 2/3 of actual i get in that resto. that means cut in quantity and plus delivery charge. its cheating when u get delivery charges then how swiggy have rights to cut down quantity of food. i’ll never ever use swiggy any more. its better for me to get autorickshaw return which cost me rs. 30 fair. but its ok. i’ll get full food quantity. app uninstalled now."
I was extremely hungry and ordered food from Swiggy. Though I always order from Zomato but this time I did it from Swiggy in Hope of getting food early as their tag line says #LightandFastDelivery. So I ordered A green apply drink and a haleem- Biryani Combo from Behrouz. After about half an hour a got a call from Swiggy saying that the drink is not available. I asked them to give some other drink or lemonade to which they said they don't have any drink. If this is so then why do you people show in in the menu. This does not stop here so then I received my order which had only biryani. I calleContinue ReadingI was extremely hungry and ordered food from Swiggy.

This does not stop here so then I received my order which had only biryani. I called the delivery boy and asked him for the missing item which was haleem to which he replied I will check and he did not revert. I called the Customer care service and a lady told me that I can either wait they will coordinate with the restaurant or I can get a coupon. I was so pissed off that I said give me the coupon. Afterwards I got to know that they could have transferred the amount in my account as I paid from net banking. I asked that lady to do the net banking to which she said madam but I have already given you the coupon as you said. I told her you did not tell me about this option that you can transfer the cash also. She said sorry mam next time if it happens then you can ask for cash but now I have given the coupon.So I just wanna say to Swiggy that I am highly dissatisfied and the food which I got was cold and missing items. If you are going to work this ways then you cannot go in a long run. I would not suggest any one to order from Swiggy.
I ordered fast food from one of famous restaurant through swiggy for my team mates in office.My order got confirmed & they gave me 45 minutes to wait. Order confirmation time was 05:43 pm & Delivery time was 07:05 pm.My team mates were waiting for order. Our official leaving time from office is 06:30 even though they were waiting for food. Don’t know why swiggy took so much time to deliver the food.This was bad experience from swiggy. Please deliver the food within expected time frame which you mention in waiting time period.
"My first experience was very bad. I order dinner from swaggy for first time. They did not provided Bill from the same. I called the customer care guy, he told me to wait for 24 hrs. After 24 hrs no bill was there. I talked with customer care thrice but same repeated answer was given. And still I don't received the bill. Never going to order from swaggy anymore. Very bad customer care."
Just worse..there customer support is useless..they simply charged money on my account and they do not have phone call support unless you have an active order…
your order and then they charge you 75rs for cancelling the order by their own very bad service never going to use it again. And this is not the first time they always do this. I will Never this to anyone or anybody.
I have received less quality food from Birmies which is was ordered from Swiggy. so i am trying to connect to Swiggy to complain about food quality. There is no any issue platform provided where i can put my complain. Online chat process is only for show peace and they are not providing revert even after 10 min. They are saying that revert with exacted withing 3 min but i have waited till 10 min. Even their CC phone is also not working… such a hell of service response from Swiggy..
Pathetic Service. Royal cheats.After making the payment they say restaurant is closed and never refund the money. Be careful

I happy to review him. Once when I ordered once and done my billing after my payment he said the hotel was closed and cannot deliever order the order and then he said he will provide you other hotel which is far distant from me but he said I can order anything of hiking 100rs for my prior order. I felt happy but the delivery was bit slow.But if we compare the swiggy with food panda the app is good and easily understandable and more ever in food panda we dont have featureCash on Deliverybut the Siggy provides this.
Simply pathetic. I had ordered Bhindi and roti and they made me wait for 3.5 hours and didnt even answer my calls. Customer care representative simply hung up on me each time. The service was unbearable. And after all that the delivery guy turned up with a vada pav after 3.5 hours - something that i didnt even order and asked to give good review!The sheer nerve of these guys! I hope they lose their business…worthless piece of shit!
"It's really good. I don't know how people face so many problems. I have always got on time or before time delivery with always the correct order. I live in Kamla Nagar, the Delhi University North Campus.I like the speed and the courteousness of the delivery guys.Overall Quite good."

This is deeply disappointing for me, since, impressed by the wonderful service swiggy provided initially, I had very recently purchased the swiggy super membership. However, it seems that post that, there's been numerous glitches with my orders.Once, the order that I received was spilled inside the carry bag it came in. Twice it has happened that I ordered an item, and then the restaurant, AFTER accepting my order called me up and said that they didn't have the items I ordered. Twice, I ordered 2 items but the delivery guy appears with only 1, and I was called up by the agent and told that she was cancelling my order as they didn't have the other item in stock. Mind you, this was after the delivery person tried to pass off 1 item as two to me. And now this.To top it all off, when I tried customer care, I was told in no uncertain terms that I will not be compensated.I find this very saddening that an order (quite expensive, might i mention) was goofed up so well and yet they refuse to compensate ME MY money for an order which I had to THROW in the dustbin as otherwise it could have had horrifying medical consequences for me.Moreover, on trying to get a compensation via email, they had the nerve to reply with “in view of the frequent issues that you've experienced in the recent past, we cannot compensate”. It is incomprehensible to me."

Swiggy is the best in food delivery as well as food quality. My experience was just awesome . The food delivered to at night 11.15 and i orders just half an hour before. I love this site. Awesome experience.
"Swiggy is a fraud! Many a times, my order was picked up by the delivery guy, who conveniently ignored to update the system, took the order home and I had to sleep hungry as the restaurants close by 11 PM and Swiggy notified me at 11:35 PM that the order is cancelled.I have been talking to them since 8 days now. No action or any suitable compensation offered by Swiggy.Their support system, mail and chat both, are absolutely pathetic. I have decided to switch to the more reliable option Zomato. And I also wish more companies emerge in this space to take Swiggy the fraudster down."

"I have ordered from Swiggy multiple times, but this time, I had a bad experience. I ordered 2 boxes of kaju barfi, which costed me ₹171 before taxesThey didn't provide me the bill when the order was delivered.

"Ah, Swiggy, the knight in shining armor during hunger pangs and culinary cravings! My experience with Swiggy has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride through the flavors of India.Picture this: It's a rainy evening, and my craving for hot samosas hits an all-time high. With a few swift taps on the Swiggy app, I summon my favorite snack from a local eatery, eagerly awaiting its arrival like a child on Christmas morning.But here's the twist: While Swiggy often delivers joy and gastronomic satisfaction, occasional delays and mix-ups can dampen the mood like a sudden downpour.

However, their customer service, like a diligent friend, often steps in to save the day with prompt resolutions.And guess what adds a cherry on top of this culinary adventure? Craveo, the newfound love of my foodie journey, surprises me with irresistible discounts on Swiggy orders, making every bite more delightful and every rupee well spent.In conclusion, while Swiggy may have its ups and downs, its ability to bring the flavors of India to my doorstep, coupled with Craveo's generous discounts, makes it a culinary companion worth relying on."
"If you had asked me the question few years ago I would have said Swiggy but right now my Answer is Zomato.The reason is the Zomato CEO himself is taking initiative for brand building like podcasts, acting as delivery boy, etc. and implementing the changes real fast.Recently, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal acted as a delivery partner with his wife Grecia Munoz to deliver food to customers in Gurugram.

Dressed in Zomato uniforms the duo hopped onto a bike to deliver customer orders. However, they were denied entry to Ambience Mall and forced to use service stairs. He went ‘undercover’ that day to understand the daily challenges of the delivery agents. Experiencing the denial at Gurugram’s Ambience Mall, he posted a video of his experience, after which Ambience Mall immediately responded and the administration took quick measures to improve working conditions for delivery workers.If you ask about discounts and stuff Swiggy might be better but this thing leaves a lasting impact on people and customer.Anugrhitoasmi 💛"
"I was sent non veg food instead of vegetarian food on three occasions. It means Swiggy only takes care of the delivery. It does not bother to check how the restaurants are preparing food …The delivery boys will call you two to three times per order, to ask you for your address, even though your address, directions are already provided. It is very disturbing.

Just the only material wrapping your food will be there most often. No outer cover/ bag most often."

"I don’t like Swiggy.A week ago, it was my daughter’s birthday. That was the day I used Swiggy for the first time because my wife always made fun of me for being so low-tech (I work in the IT Industry!!!) and not keeping up with times (“you are only person who goes to a restaurant to pick up food” - she claimed)So, I installed Swiggy and ordered food for the birthday party 2 hours before the start of the party. The app showed 35 minutes for delivery so I was assured that they would deliver on time.40 minutes after the order, I receive a call from Delivery Boy (so called Delivery Partner) informContinue ReadingI don’t like Swiggy.A week ago, it was my daughter’s birthday.

The app showed 35 minutes for delivery so I was assured that they would deliver on time.40 minutes after the order, I receive a call from Delivery Boy (so called Delivery Partner) informing me that his bike tyre has punctured so he cannot deliver. He asked me to cancel the order. I asked him why he doesn’t do that. He told me that Delivery boys don’t have access to Swiggy (plain lie!!!)I called up Swiggy and told them about it. They said that they will replace the order so that a new delivery boy will deliver. They again gave me 35 minutes delivery time.After 30 minutes, I again received a call from another number. A new delivery boy this time. He said that he cannot bring food because the restaurant has refused to give him food (the first delivery boy ran away with the original order, it seems).I again called up Swiggy. They somehow managed to convince the restaurant owner to provide food. I finally got food after around 10–11 calls and 2 hours 30 minutes (since I first ordered the food).I was simply shocked at the audacity of Swiggy Customer Care when they called me next day to take feedback on their “excellent service”. I told them that was the first and last time I ordered food through Swiggy. I would prefer to drive to a restaurant and pick up food rather than live in anxiety for 2–3 hours."
"swiggy is into unethical practice . They had opened there own delivery restaurant at Plot No.8 Harsha City Mall ,Indirapuram and they close all the restaurants in the close victinity at 11:00pm so that they can fetch buisness for there resturant in Indirapuram Ghaziabad."

There is an option to choose between the five. Ultimately, instead of the five shown, you would get only one savoury and only one pastry."
"Swiggy is actually not a good company with good values. thats whats wrong. The Gen Z companies seems to follow the same trend, Let me explain. pleaseWhy is swiggy not a Ethical Company :Fraud / Unfair (fake) Pricing :an item eg, curd rice is 40rs but in swiggy it is 60 rs ( coz swiggy takes up 10–24% of margin from all restaurants) .then they add packing charges, then they add 5% gst ( even if the restaurant only charges 40rs including packing and tax) + delivery charges ( even if u have super its only valid on orders above 100rs) + distance fee(if).so now the total is around 120rs . lol 40Continue ReadingSwiggy is actually not a good company with good values. thats whats wrong.

( how do i know , let me explain..) swiggy charges cancellation fee for us, incase if we cancel. But for restaurants it doesn't, only if there are many negative feedback ( in 1000’s) only then they enquire.. that's it. anyone can guess why., coz they dnt want to tighten coz they will then wont pay swiggy margins.Listing Scam :Maybe many of them doesn't know, swiggy has its own restaurants masking as high end real restaurants, this are the once with flashy catch photos, which usually come first in list, all real restaurants come below them. This swiggy restaurants are priced very high.. even though they don't even have the board in reality as a hotel. and this are the restaurants which has more offers ( like 50% off use swiggy it coupon) some of this such scam non restaurants are, “ bowl company, homely, etc.. swiggy pushes this restaurants in all in app banners to make user book it and make more money.Delivery Guy Issues:60% of orders in swiggy never get delivered on time , mostly reason being, delivery guy not available or he is available and accepted the order, but he is chilling in home, once order comes then he gets up, brushes his teeth , has breakfast then he goes to pickup. Delivery guy of swiggy never wear their T-Shirt or has bag, they shove pizza in their collage shoulder bag vertically. ( u know what happens to pizza right), every food is handled in crappy way. 95% of delivery guys do this., i have rarely seen anyone at all having a bag to keep food. They do this becoz they dnt care about our ratings (unlike zomato, where they do nealty where rating is imp). i can go on of why and how, but its over this scope.Immoral code of conduct :Wherever there is a issue, there never care. the customer care says “we are sorry, we will take feedback”. but its just fake thing, even though they are doing it, no one is reading . only 0.1% of issues are seen. ( not solved). if any issue. then they say. write email to some mail id. ( they have done this to waste our time and make us give upon money. effective from dec 2019). i have raised 350+ cases from past 1 and half years and spending nearly spending 1.5 lack INR. NONE .. 0 has been solved till dateBlame others :When there is an order delivered correctly on time, swiggy says we have delivered correctly, but when it goes wrong.. here are their reasons :If payment problems : Sir, payment gateway issue sir, what we can do? we will take feedback sirIf server down : Sir check your internet sir, what we can do? we will take feedback sirIf technical Glitch : Sir some technical issue sir, what we can do? we will take feedback sirIf item not available : Sir restaurant has not updated items sir, what we can do? we will take feedback sirIf delivery guy is not available/ not up to mark : Sir delivery guy problam, not everyone follow the norms, what we can do? we will take feedback sirIf food spillage or item missing : Sir restaurant has not done it properly, what we can do? we will take feedback sirIf delivery goes more than expected time : Sir, traffic, no petrol, accident, etc etc. what we can do sir, we will take feedback.If refund or money issues : Sir, RBI rules sir,,, .. what we can do….. so onU name it, whatever happens they have a ready answer to blame someoneBut when there is a correct delivery,, they day.. “ SIR SWIGGY HAS DONE IT”..THE GEN Z APP CULTURE PROBLEM :Most of the Generation Z apps from 2010 specially has found that.. “ to grow as a company, we actually don't need to solve customer issues, we just need to expand company, and show positive growth and increase valuation of company, so people will do big investments and we shall make money”For investors only thing that matters is “ am i gonna get good returns” andNOT“Whether the company i am investing is a moral one or solving customer issues”All swiggy does is.. get more margins on restaurants, expand to more cities get more employes. and increase company valuation and get more investors and make more money. andone fine day this charade ends.,Then they will file for bankruptcy, and go away, people working there, investors, banks who has given money all sit n cry. and we the TAX payers have to cough up that money.SAD story, but true.I highly recommend “zomato”, and i m not saying zomato is perfect.. nothing in the entire world is perfect, but zomato is way better in moral.. their code of conduct. They care, they add really really good features. like events, spl pics, pay later, “ON TIME OR FREE” So many. I had learnt this truth sadly late. now i am using zomato every day. i see that those who say 50% off take extra 20 rs from us without noticing.Uf,, it was a big review. but yea. if you are still reading this cheers. give it a thumbs up.Thanks"

Yes swiggy is a very big scam specially some of it's delivery partners. I ordered from this app and saw delivery partner taking a few things out of my delivery package.

Today I was planning to order from Swiggy. Burger King had 40% off by using the code SWIGGYIT. So I thought of ordering from there. But I was shocked to see the way these people are cheating us.It showed delivery fee as Rs.44 because it is raining ( you can see the symbol next to it) but it's 1:20 in the noon and perfectly sunny here.As you can see the taxes are Rs. 46 and when adding with the delivery fee it becomes Rs.90. They are giving us Rs. 80 off which means after the offer we still have to give Rs.10 extra. So what is the point in giving 40% off?!These people gives us offers and adjustContinue ReadingToday I was planning to order from Swiggy. Burger King had 40% off by using the code SWIGGYIT.

So what is the point in giving 40% off?!These people gives us offers and adjust that amount through delivery fee and taxes. We all know that the prices of some food items are higher in swiggy.I had once ordered a cake from swiggy but when I checked the box I found that they charged Rs. 150 more than the MRP ( Sorry I don't have the Photos). So I wrote a mail to them and they gave that amount back as a Flat Rs.150 off coupon. Even though it was their fault they didn't give the actual money back instead gave it as a coupon which is still beneficial for them as they could adjust some of it as taxes and delivery fees.Not everyone might notice or react to these kind of problems which makes it profitable for them. So try not to fall for these type of exploitations.

I am telling this on the basis of my experience. Yes, various factors might differ from location to location. Let me share an incident with y’all. 😆A few months back, on the occasion of teacher’s day, our physics teacher decided to give us a treat. During that time, around 17 students were present in the class (basically, it was the tuition center). He then told us to order something online for which, he would pay. All of us decided to order some egg rolls. But, here is the catch. One of my friends proposed the crazy idea ofordering the food from both Swiggy and Zomato and checking which one would be delivered faster. All of us liked the idea, thus, we ordered 9 egg rolls from Swiggy and 8 egg rolls from Zomato, also, from the same restaurant.Everything was going fine, the order was prepared, and the delivery guys arrived at the place. In the meantime, they collected our order and left the restaurant. As we expected, the delivery guy from Swiggy came before and delivered our food. We kept that order aside and waited for the Zomato one, as everyone wanted to celebrate the occasion together.Suddenly, my friends noticed that in the Zomato app, it was being shown that thedelivery guy was not moving from his place.10 minutes passed, and there was no change. Another 10 minutes passed, and still nothing. We were frustrated and decided to call the restaurant at first. The manager at the restaurant said that theorder had already been taken away. Then, wecalled the Delivery Guy. He picked up the call. When we asked him about the food,he replied to us that he wasn’t the Delivery Guy!!! We just left the order as it is. It wasn’t canceled and didn’t arrive ever.Seriously Zomato?😒Peace ✌-PBP.S.: We got another 8 eggrolls from Swiggy later on 😆"

The other piece was missing and so we knew that the agent must have eaten it. Else, the packing was fine and we ignored it.Two pieces of paneer tikka was missing at another order. We knew the number as that wasn't the first time we were ordering from that specific restaurant. Yet we didn't bother to complain. Probably, the agent was too hungry or tempted :)Another time, some of the milkshake that was packed in a sealed paper container had spilled wetting the packing of few other items inside the bag. But the damage was minimal and we could manage..While I thought why couldn't they pack and seal it more tightly — my recent experience at few of the juice and milkshake stores at a small town in TN, made me realize that the packing of liquids at fast food and juice joints in the cities and metros were so much better.The shopkeepers at those small town outlets said they packed only in small plastic covers for take away or delivery and none of them ever used disposable paper glasses or cups!.So to conclude, I don't dislike Swiggy..Whatever problems we faced with them till date have been quite manageable..Representative image from alamy stock images."

"@Deepinder GoyalHere I am going to tell you that how Zomato is fooling their customers. Recently I experienced something which is really not acceptable.Actually one of the best restaurant of madiwala area which is known as “ASHIRVAAD GRAND PURE VEG RESTAURANT”is located just 400m away from my PG. I use to go there once in every 2 to 3 days by walk. So that is why I am familiar with restaurant's Menu card. But today I had some work so I thought I will order from Zomato.Now as I opened the restaurant Menu in Zomato app I found myself in shock after looking at the menu card.The prices were so hiContinue Reading@Deepinder GoyalHere I am going to tell you that how Zomato is fooling their customers.

But today I had some work so I thought I will order from Zomato.Now as I opened the restaurant Menu in Zomato app I found myself in shock after looking at the menu card.The prices were so high than real menu card. I am sharing a picture which is given below. Red color prices are the original prices of restaurant.Means every dish has a price difference of 20 to 25 rupees. And when I added a 90 rupees meal(Butter roti curry) in my cart then for getting my order at my home I had to pay 134 rupees. Can you believe it??It is really a huge difference. If I go to restaurant then simply I have to pay only 70 rupees for the same dish for which I had to pay 134 rupees on zomato app. This is really bad.I kindly request to all online food delivery applications, please stop looting us.Thanks for reading!!Image source:-Screenshots are taken from Zomato app"
"Swiggy is now shamelessly charging extra money on every dish ordered + convenience delivery fees above the restuarant charghes, just compared its price aganist actual hotel menu.. Swiggy has shamelessly spiked every item prices by 40% .. WOW"

"So, today evening Husband and I felt like ordering ice cream from swiggy and decided to order it through instamart. We have ordered groceries, vegetables and fruits but this was our first time with icecream. (That too on a may month)Our instamart driver had one other order to deliver as it was showed in swiggy map. We were like worried about our drooping ice-cream as our delivery was getting little late. But wait look at their packagingThey had a nice thermal pouch kind of bag and had Gel frost packs. We couldn't stop smiling looking at this. Wow instamart you just took both of us by surpriseContinue ReadingSo, today evening Husband and I felt like ordering ice cream from swiggy and decided to order it through instamart.

I have observed vegetables catching fungus more rapidly If you purchase from Swiggy Instamart.Swiggy just blabbers around to trap customers to face their pathetic service & at the same time you can get better experience from some company like BBNow.Just Research about their major stakeholders you will realize which one is more reliable.
"Well i stay and work in Koramangala, Bangalore. and have extensively used both Swiggy and Uber Eats, so I am in a position to comment on pros and cons of both, I never used Zomato for food ordering but Zomato app is very very good for finding local restaurants and cuisines.

(Search for Legendary outlets in your city)SWIGGY :PROSIts the food delivery app with the widest coverage of restaurants in any area.They regularly have several restaurants on discounted prices.Food ordering and tracking is hassle-free.They have a huge network of delivery executives, so very rarely is food delayed due to unavailability of delivery executives. (At least in my area).They now operate till 3 am in some areas.CONSThe delivery fee of 35 rupees (aside from packing charges) on any order below 250 Rs irrespective of the restaurant distance is just murder on the wallet.Customer Care is very inefficient & inconsistent, multiple times (not always) I have been promised refunds (for late delivery or bad & missing food), but have had to do several followups to actually get the refund.They have now started charging a distance fee for restaurants which they claim are too far from my house but earlier no such fee was charged for the same restaurants, This is just milking the customer (aside from the delivery charges).Some restaurants have fixed charges of 50 Rs, aside from the packing and delivery charges. For the Life of me I haven’t understood why!!.It does not have cheap combo meal options, Not everyday I feel like eating expensive, unhealthy food. (Recently they started copying Uber Eats in this regard, but still comparatively it is much too expensive and barely any options).During peak hours and holidays several restaurants become unserviceable, I have not had this issue but I suppose it depends on the region and restaurant, several of my friends have faced this situation.UBER EATSPROSDelivery fee is just Rs 1.They have amazing Breakfast (Rs 65) and Lunch (Rs 99) combos. I just Love this feature, I have almost stopped using Swiggy because of it. I try new combos almost everyday.The Restaurant network is fast expanding and includes small restaurants which offer cheap, tasty and affordable food.Food ordering and tracking is hassle-free.Food delivery can be scheduled for any time during the day. (Not sure if Swiggy has this feature).CONSPayment option of only Paytm works for me.Customer Care takes a little while longer to address your concern via chat section.Twice I have had my order delivery delayed due to unavailability of delivery executive. (But they gave me discount coupons in exchange, So I guess that worked out).SUMMARYSo in short it depends on the customer, I usually order food for one person and for me Swiggy was always a little too expensive, but if you can afford the cash or are ordering for 2 or more people then go for it.Uber Eats is my current favorite with its affordable rates and amazing varieties of Food Combos. So to anyone interested I would wholeheartedly recommend Uber-Eats."
I prefer swiggy. 2 reasons always cost is bit cheaper in swiggy whenever I compare with Zomato. And delivery time is 5 to 10 mins faster in swiggy in my banglore location. Any problems I seen swiggy service handles well compared to Zomato. This is just my experience I faced with both. But have ordered so many orders in both apps.

In the above order Zomato has failed to meet the service condition but cheated my money.3. Read the conversation - promo code offered by Zomato - wherein Zomato has not mentioned validity of 30 days, but only in Zomato’s subsequent message the validity period appeared.4. Further, I have not entered into any agreement with the promo code company. Zomato only entered into an agreement with promo code company to cheat their customers. Who permitted Zomato to enter such agreement with promo code company for my money?5. I asked Zomato to give the details of the company with whom my money is now available along with the agreement Zomato entered with such promo code company.6. I find Zomato company has cheated me with my money with promo code offer instead of crediting the amount back to my account once they are unable to meet the requirements of customers7. This type of cheating requires fitting punishment.please report similar cheating done by Zomato."
