"Swiggy is taking much longer to assign delivery partners, and the delivery times are significantly slower compared to Zomato near Marsur Chandapura. For the past two weeks, we've had an awful experience receiving parcels for my parents and kids. Despite the Swiggy representative repeatedly apologizing, it’s not helping. Please be aware and take action—once you place an order, make sure to pay upon delivery, not online."
Recently I have order Pizza in the Swiggy Application total Bill 124 rs but delivery guy came and said 199 rs paid system generated how is it ps
"Recently, I had been scammed on Swiggy by a fraudulent delivery driver. This was one of my first times using swiggy so I wasn't aware of the nits and gritts. However, I had ordered a cake on swiggy and it was marked as a priority order. It required a pin to be delivered. I wasn't aware of the exact use of the pin and that it was supposed to be given when the order was received. Not when the order is about to be delivered. The delivery driver called me up asking for the pin and stating his claim to be' I can't seem to access your location. I will require your pin for your location'. I, unknowingly, gave him my pin and he marked my order as delivered.  The infuriating part was when I tried to call his number through the swiggy app, someone else picked up. It was a different number than what he had called from. His number in the app was fake. I lost money that day. I even contacted Swiggy's customer support. They stated that my claims had no base and that it's marked delivered so it must be delivered and they haven't compensated yet. I tried to explain the situation but to no avail. It's frustrating and infuriating I must say. Never trusting Swiggy again."
We run a cloud kitchen in Pune. Without our knowledge swiggy employees are running Ads and discount offers for our outlet and deduct our money from payout. What a shameful act for eating our hard earned. Somebody please help me to sue this company. They can reach me on my email id or reply here.
Does not allow refund if restaurant misses any item. Customer support was very unsatisfactory and bad
I ordered using their application and it was not fulfilled and when I contacted customer service they didn't know tamil and zero knowledge on english language it was just waste of time contacting customer service.
"Swiggy can rename itself to Swindler Swiggy. Food was delivered after 2 hours and the package (spillage, dirt) was in such a condition that the food could only be thrown away. The customer service was deplorable.  After trying to track food and cancelling the subscription Swiggy just lies by saying that you can cancel subscription when actually there is no way to cancel. Imagine the scam they are committing with this BLCK option"
"I have order salad from subway through swiggy this is how i have received the parcel, When I ask delivery boy to take it back he refuse to take it back, he said call subway they will give you refund & when i tried to call on the number which is given there on google as well as on Swiggy there number is continuously ringing No one answer the call.I wrote this feedback because there are many people who ordered online they should know & stop ordering through swiggy & from subway for sure, this is also about how they treat there customer for sure put a complaint in consumer court for the service. When I ask them for refund they told me to give a feedback to restaurant there we're not going to provide refund"
Worst app ever ..please don't use swiggy app....order cancle krne pr refund nhi dete ye log mera 1000 ka nuksan ho gaya haii..worst worst app ..inka 400000000000 nuksan ho jaye ..logo ke paise khate hai ye log
I ordered mc donald  It had a black partical like chicken blood it was completely stail and brand like mcdonals
"I ordered food through the Swiggy App. I received a missing item from Navtara restaurant, Siolim, Goa. I reported to the customer service to inform the restaurant to provide me the missing item after video verification. Swiggy executive says that I have to pay again for my missing item. Swiggy fined me 124/- for Navtara restaurant mismanagement. They're gathering money from the customer by illegal way. The restaurant and swiggy denying the mistake and blames the customer. Useless services"
"When collecting your order, check that all the items have been delivered before you hand over your money because they just keep your cash even if they have failed to deliver the items."
Had ordered food late night on 28th Jan(Order # 196974022313856) but the delivery guy named Dharmesh Kumar(0804406xxxx) was very rude in behavior and clearly denied to deliver the order. Even I tried to take support from Customer service but no help received and Customer service simply informed that delivery guy has denied to give the order. Got no solution just refunded my amount. But what about the wastage of time?
Yesterday I order food in swiggy order I’d-196613238992361.  We waited long time but order not got delivered and delivery partner not picking the call.  After giving the complaint we got to know he delivered the item with OTP but we did not shared any OTP to any one. Be careful with this kind of frauds.
"It's about order where payment was made in advance. The cunning Swiggy has policy of not arranging refund if order is placed. on the other hand the fox cunning rider who denied to deliver the order since the location was not mapped to provided address. WT foolish reason on making fool out of people. I wasted money thinking of giving surprise to my cousin by sending case but was fooled by company. it's about order dated 21 jan 2025 , ORDER No. #196442407058138 . refund Rs. 261 refused by Swiggy"
Swiggy is assigning 2 deliveries at one time when i ordered last time after i placed order it shown like 45 to 50 mins but even after 1.20 mins not even picked the order. In the customer care they said if u want to cancel mean you can cancel even after 1 hour they simply saying cancel not care about who is hunger waiting for their food
"Swiggy’s Absolute Worst Delivery Experience – A Masterclass in Horrible Customer Service  If I could give Swiggy negative stars, I absolutely would. What unfolded last night was nothing short of a disaster—an absolute mockery of what a “world-class delivery service” should be. Swiggy, with all its marketing gimmicks and tall claims about seamless food delivery, has officially hit rock bottom in customer service, empathy, and basic accountability.  We placed an order at 10 PM, expecting a reasonable delivery time. But instead, the Swiggy delivery person decided to take a scenic tour of Bangalore, roaming around Sarjapur Road like he was on a midnight joyride, before inexplicably heading off to Electronic City—miles away from our location. The incompetence was laughable, if not outright infuriating.  When we reached out to Swiggy’s so-called customer support, hoping for some clarity and resolution, we were fed empty assurances and blatant lies— “The order will be delivered in some time.” Oh really? Another 30 minutes passed, and yet, the delivery guy was still showing in Electronic City. What was he doing there? Having a picnic? Running his own errands? Because at this point, it was clear Swiggy had no control over their own delivery personnel.  And what did Swiggy do when we asked for cancellation and compensation for this outrageous delay and sheer negligence? Nothing. Absolutely nothing—except offering a measly ₹46 as some pathetic excuse for compensation. ₹46 for an order that was supposed to arrive in minutes but never came. ₹46 for a child who ordered food, kept waiting hungrily, only to fall asleep disappointed and empty-stomached. ₹46 for wasting over an hour and a half of our time.  This is beyond atrocious customer service—it is utter disregard for customers, their time, and their basic expectations. If Swiggy cannot ensure timely deliveries, handle issues responsibly, or even offer meaningful compensation when they screw up this badly, then they have no business running a food delivery service at all.  Their blatant lack of accountability, absolute disregard for customer inconvenience, and the sheer audacity to refuse meaningful compensation for their own failure is nothing short of appalling. Swiggy is a shining example of everything that is wrong with customer service today—big promises in ads but zero actual care for real customers when they need support.  If you care about timely food delivery, responsible customer service, and not being blatantly cheated, then AVOID SWIGGY AT ALL COSTS.  Swiggy, shut down your business if you can’t even do the basics right."
"Dear All,  Swiggy service is too good. Its depends n us. you have to request the customer support people. dont use the abuse words while you are talking.  Thanks & Regards  Anshu"
"Extremely disappointed with my recent experience with Swiggy. I placed an order a few days ago, and the food delivered was cold, stale, and completely inedible. It was clear that it had been sitting for hours before reaching me, and calling it ""fresh"" would be a joke.  To make matters worse, when I raised a complaint, Swiggy took a whole week just to ask for a food image! Who keeps leftover food or packaging for a week? Despite sharing the image immediately, no action was taken from their side. Instead, they ignored my emails and kept delaying the resolution.  This is unacceptable customer service. If this is how Swiggy operates, I can confidently say I’ll never recommend Swiggy to anyone. Absolutely pathetic service!"
Swiggy is very very very very bad bad bad bad app never returns the money and never accept the false and never replied on the falsely order so so much badly customer services . This app should be closed.Sent me expired product and denied to exchange or return. Very annoying…
Swiggy is very very very very bad bad bad bad app never returns the money and never accept the false and never replied on the falsely order so so much badly customer services . This app should be closed .Swiggy destroyed my fathers birthday. This app should be closed
"Dear Every one,  Requesting all of you to pay your high attention if you don't want to take a chance with your hard earning money!  In short and simple THIRD CLASS SERVICES WITH FULL OF ARROGANCE and ATTITUDE . It will start with the DELIVERY PERSON and end to ESCALATION DESK!  Cause, post that if you even mail any concern to their higher management also they GIVE A SHT.  No mater . inspite of of giving you . proper address or rather say registered address if the Delivery Person feel not to climb up up to your floor and just try 1 or 2 miss call, they will immediately cancel your order despite of a Pre Paid Order!  Will give simply EXCUSES . You have not pick-up or responded .  GUYS . please do charity of that amount if you really spend money in novel cause BUT Pls Pls DON'T go with these FRAUDS  I will NEVER EVER USE THIS SWIGGY or RECOMMEND TO ANY ONE"
Totally worst service from your end  Want my money back otherwise will escalate this issue to the higher officials
"To Whom It May Concern,  I am writing to formally bring to your attention an issue I faced while using your services, which has caused me significant inconvenience and financial loss. Below are the details of the incident:    I placed an order on your platform for delivery to another person. The delivery address and contact details were correctly provided.    The delivery agent called me, and I clarified that the order was for another individual, whose details were already mentioned. Despite this, the agent stated that the order was “not for you, ” abruptly ended the call, and canceled the order.    Following this, I contacted your support team to request either a refund or a reattempt at delivery. However, I was wrongfully held responsible for the issue, and my request was denied.      This is unacceptable. Swiggy has failed to fulfill its obligation to deliver the product and has also refused to provide a refund, which constitutes a breach of consumer trust and rights.  I hereby demand the following:    An immediate refund of the full amount paid for the canceled order.    A written apology for the inconvenience caused.    Appropriate disciplinary action against the delivery agent and the support executive involved.      As per the applicable consumer rights under the laws of India , I am entitled to a resolution of this grievance. Should you fail to address my concerns within 24-48 hours, I will be compelled to pursue legal action to claim remedies for:  • Financial loss.  • Emotional distress.  • Fraudulent business practices.  I retain the right to utilize all available evidence, including customer service call recordings and chat transcripts, to substantiate my claims in a legal forum if necessary.  I trust that you will address this matter promptly to avoid escalation. Please confirm receipt of this notice and provide a resolution at the earliest.  In furtherance please note the below. The issue is not the amount but unfair means - I had requested a re delivery which too was refused - hence the issue went to this point.    Consumer Protection Act, 2019     • Deficiency in Service (Section 2(11)): Failure to deliver the product and refusal to refund constitutes a deficiency in service.  • Unfair Trade Practices (Section 2(47)): Refusal to refund or redeliver despite the issue being caused by the delivery agent will be deemed as an unfair trade practice.  • complaint with the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District, State, or National Commission based on the claim amount).    Indian Contract Act, 1872     • Breach of Contract: When Swiggy accepted the payment, a service contract was formed. Your failure to deliver the order or refund the money constitutes a breach of contract (Section 73).    Information Technology Act, 2000     • Failure to Protect Consumer Data (Section 43A): held liable for damages. This includes any misuse of the address or contact details provided for the order.  4.Civil Law  • Negligence: The delivery agent’s and support team’s actions amounts to negligence, as their failure to deliver the order and wrongful cancellation caused me loss and distress.  • Mental Distress: i claim damages for the emotional and mental distress caused by Swiggy’s actions.    Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC)     • Fraud (Section 415): Refusing a refund while failing to deliver the service amounts to cheating.  • Criminal Breach of Trust (Section 406): As Swiggy refuses to refund despite accepting payment, it amounts to criminal breach of trust.  I retain my rights to file a complaint with the District Consumer Forum.  and take the matter before civil courts or invoke criminal provisions under the IPC."
"""I'm extremely disappointed with Swiggy! I received stale food, which I complained about, and the thought of my baby consuming it is alarming. The customer service was unresponsive, offering a meager refund of ₹15 for a ₹320 order. Their service is subpar, and I strongly advise against ordering from them."""
"Had the worst experience with Swiggy! I ordered Chicken Biryani from Absolute Barbeque, but to my shock, I received sweets from Pulla Reddy instead. What an amazing experience (sarcasm)! This is completely unacceptable. Swiggy's customer support is useless and provides no real help. The whole system feels like a fraud, and there’s no accountability. I would strongly recommend NOT to order anything from Swiggy if you value your time and money. Terrible service!"
Order no. 195287529527892 I have not received the food items. This is mere technical glinch in swiggy website showing incorrect address even after mentioning landmark and location. Having come half of the way the delivery person stopped and argued with me saying why should he come.. The way he talked was really frustrating. Swiggy person cancelled the order. How can swiggy charge entire bill amount as cancellation fee without delivery. Does it make sense...? This is highly unacceptable and rediculous. I want the entire amount refund. Having sent mail till now no action taken.  Never order in swiggy. Delivery person wont deliver your food and swiggy steals your money for sure. My humble request. Really worst experience i faced last 48 hours.
"I have ordered for some grocery items including some masalas and they delivered it.After that when I checked the items one of the masalas powder(nirapara chilli powder)they delivered has expired and I raised complaint in chat , there was no proper response.Again I mailed support member attaching the video and photos again the response was bullshit.I paid for the expired product, but they were not providing me replacement for the product..worst customer service ever."
"It happend two times, 1st was on 1st December 2024 and 2nd time was on 9 January 2025, I orderd in haldiram on 9 January and one product was missing, haldiram and swiggy both cheated me.bad experience? when I was complained but no answer"
"I’m have been a frequent user of Swiggy Platform and now in the recent times been a victim at least 2 times. Once the food delivered was fully spilled and smashed which Swiggy refused to refund, second time my order was cancelled by the delivery guy and Swiggy didn’t accept thier fault to refund."
Your executive had no behaviour how to communicate with customers and your relatives restaurents had been closed after order thats why zomato is good in compare of you
"They are doing multiple orders delivery with same delivery person so they add up extra 15 mins minimum to the actual expected time post placing order.  Agents have no hold or control to provide any solution too. Order comes late, food comes not even warm. On the whole very poor service.  Pity for the delivery partners."
I was order hazelnut cake from swiggy on 22nd Dec-24. Qty is 1. 5 ka they are provide on 500gm cake only very wrist quality and low quality  And also I was paid advance re 1697. But they are not provide me cake and also still now not refund my fund. They are fraud you can't buy any thing from swiggy. And never psy him advance. They have no class.  I have order butterscotch cake  They provide chocolate cake..  Order first one  Provide me 2 image
I was order 4 items on swiggy in that 1 item is missing and even cold drinks are not chilled even after choose the chilled option..  Apart from that when I was tried to connect with them for my missing product they offer me coupons against there mistake when I ask no need of coupons I need my product they provide me support id when I was started mail conversation with them they are not even replying me for 2 days after again I was connect with chat bot they push me for the coupons by saying we can only provide you the coupons against your loss..  When I accept the coupons as per their policy I need to receive in 24-48 hrs. When it's not receive after 48 hrs connect with the customer care person he said your coupons is not punch properly i'll punch now and you need to wait more 48 hrs for  the same.  This kind of pathetic service provide by the Swiggy and harass to their customer and pushing customer to accept everything as per their norms.
For delivery they need 10 minutes and for exchange defective/ wrong items delivered they need 8 hours...ha..ha..ha
Food order was placed at 12.20 today. suddenly I cancel the order at 12.21.but customer care said that order can not be cancel. I want to cancel the order due to select wrong food due to network that conj the phone held for 10-15 sec because of the network thats why canceling the select order want to another food from swiggy .they didnt co-operate with me and charged amount 507 for cancel the order this was humorless.
"Improvements are made based on learning from mistakes. However, this company does not apply this logic. It seems to be happy to provide the customer the worst experience by providing the stupidest excuses.  Welcome to the world of Swiggy where customer support is just for the name sake.  They will send you some other dish or they may miss out on the main chicken curry but provide you with Breads. So if they haven't provided the main curry dish , they are "" happy"" to refund the amount for chicken curry but since the bread is already delivered, so there will be no refund for the bread  Had ordered Chicken biryani once but got Mutton biryani instead. The customer support is so useless and they confirmed that replacement has been ordered but after another 30 mins they say that they are not able to reach the restaurant. I called the restaurant and was able to talk to them. These stupid excuses from Swiggy has become a norm. This raises a medical concern as I am not allowed eat red meat.  They lived up to their reputation again today. They were supposed to deliver in 40 mins. After 1 hour and twenty minutes, when I inquired about my order, they called me after sometime giving a stupid excuse that it is black zone, hence my order could not be delivered and so they had to cancel my order. What ???  There are many such incidents that have occurred. The services have deteriorated over the past few years.  I would highly recommend Zomato who have improved their services over the last couple of years.  May God help the Swiggy shareholders ..."
"I had ordered a chicken bucket but I found some things missing, then I complained but there was no response and without any solution they closed down the compaints, such a big fraud service"
I didn't receive order since 75 minutes. We were hungry and chat executive was not even ready to cancel my order and was not even ready to refund my money. After long chat they just cancel order and not even restaurant and delivery boy was picking our phones. They just blaming each other's. How you can keep anyone hungry for more than 1 hr. Bad bad expere
It is shameful that continuously 3 time in 6months it happened. My today's incident I placed an order at 9:10 am but it was not reflected on order icon instead it was in my cart only so again clicked to place the order now on order it started reflecting 2 orders in a gap of 1 min. I cancelled one to avoid duplicated orderin a min only so 9:11 am 1/2 wad cancelled but swiggy has charged 650 twice and have delivered one order. In the difference of 1 min they would not have aligned rider or have placed the order and it was problem with the app. Customer care team has refuded to refund money and they did not even raised the complaint stating they can't raise the complaint. Had given me an email id and no one has reverted me on that.  This is 3rd time happened. 5months I placed an order from the app after 1hr 50 mint chase I got to know that restaurant is not available and swiggy denied to refund the money.  Last month my sister placed an order and delivery man took the order 15km away from my place and asked me to collect from there and switched of the phone. Then a fight on call with customer care happened and they refunded the money as customer agent was not able to call the delivery man.  It seems swiggy is openly doing fraud they keep money they don't accept the mistake. They simply refuse to refund if it is customers swiggys mistake.. you can take today's case same items twice was placed first time order was placed but instead of reflecting in order icon it was reflected in my card only.. later when I clicked back 2 orders reflected and same items and the difference is 30sec to 1 min. During that time only one order was cancelled they took restaurant charges in a gap of one minute. Shameful 650 restaurant charges ?
"I had ordered a SOHAM hanger priced at 304, but I was delivered a SAAJ hanger worth 212, while 304 was charged from me. After complaining, I was told that the Soham hanger is unavailable, so no exchange is possible, & I would receive a refund of only 50/-! How is a refund of 50 justified when a product worth 212/- was charged at 304/-?When I said the refund should be 92/-, I was given Swiggy's email ID & told that nothing more could be done here, & i must email instead"
Food order was placed at 14.22 today. Till 15.45 order didnot reach. I am a dibetic. The food shop in dongripada and I am in waghbil. Walking distance 10 min. The delivery person was inThane service road. What a bad management. Ultimately I had to cancel my order. Senior citizen need food in time. Should we order from Swiggy? NO
"Food delivered very late and was in very bad condition, still Swiggy doesn't refunded full amount  It all get wet in rain"
I had ordered from Swiggy I didn’t receive the full order and was charged for the missing items and then I put a complaint that items are missing and they told me it’s delivered so I send them the photo and they say it’s not their mistake and refuse to send the remaining order and even refuse to give me the money back for the remaining item Swiggy chor
"I ordered 3 hot coffees from McDonald's and received some French fries, nuggets, and a cold coffee. After a complaint on the Swiggy app for receiving a wrong order, they emailed me that they will investigate this matter and will come back to me within 24 hours.  As per their instructions on the Swiggy app, I uploaded the photos of the order that I received, but they closed the conversation with me.  It's just so ridiculous that such a big company, known for their delivery and service, does not value their customers. They come up with all new offers like Swiggy One and Black, but I think it's a new way of making money with zero value-added services to offer.  I would request everyone before ordering on swiggy, please check your order and if you receive the wrong order that will not give you a refund. Rather call up the resturant and order."
"I had a scam from Swiggy on the 22nd of December 2024; I was terrible. The 175rs amount is deducted from my account to order Biriyani. After deducting the amount, Swiggy can't pick up the call at this given number on the application. It's 80 -69679058, whne I call on this number, telecaller asking me that this is the unregistered number ypu calling from."
"Pathetic app, food not provided in time, and always charge extra amount, so not interested .  Cheap quality food, always smells bad ."
Most of the food ordered through Swiggy are worst quality. When I raise a helpline they will simply provide one email id and close the ticket. There will not be proper response from the Swiggy food email id they provide.  1.staled food    Old food are very common when we order food through Swiggy.     They charge 30-40% additional for every order  Recently worst experience. I ordered idiysppam and paya and paya you cannot eat
Customer support staff is Highly irresponsible and does not provide any solution whenever there is an issue.
"Everything is terrible. Service, delivery, customer support, prices, offers, delivery partners. Everything is absolutely trash. Useless and not worth being a company."
Shows rhe item which are not available and charge money for it. frauds plus the customer service is worst . They threaten you and bang phone on you
I ordered 10 packets of Chings instant soup but delivery man gave me 9 packets of it and telling to complaint for the same. I returned the items back. Very rude people from Swiggy.
Very rude person. Insulting experience. I wonder how their staff has the audacity to behave so badly. Big basket is so polite n courteous
I have very bad experience with swiggy service I placed an order a few days back which I immediately canceled within one to two minutes yet the company charged me the amount of the order then such a wrong charge from the company people. Charges and misleads people so that others don't fall prey to such false charges I advise people to stay away from swiggy such misleading greedy ads and buy food from people rather than your nearby business. An aware citizen will tell you to believe in taste
I order waffle crisps from belgium waffle and first of all they showed unavailable products on website which company removed 1 month ago and delivered wrong product adter complaing support cut the call again and again after being harassed 1 hour they give half of the amount but the product they send is not of my use .
"Today I placed an order from Swiggy . It was my mom’s bday. Firstly even after providing all the delivery instructions the delivery guy couldn’t reach my place . Secondly he didn’t contact me and cancelled my order which was prepaid. Now I spoke to a Swiggy agent , he said he can’t refund me because my order was cancelled so they took the order amount as penalty fee. I’m uploading the Swiggy policy in case the customer didn’t cancel the order and it clearly said they can’t charge me according to their own policy but still the Swiggy agent didn’t refund me and refused help"
I ordered via Swiggy 10 rasmalai and 10 rasagulla  Out of 10 rasagulla only 2 were white which we ordered and rest were brown - probably jaggery - which tasted awful. Complain to Swiggy resulted in no service - even on phone. Very very disappointing. Kanti sweets should not cheat  They should have declined the order and refunded money - instead they sent a different product which we did not order or want or could eat! Still looking for a refund of 320 rupees. I will definitely not order from this Kanti sweets and also move away from Swiggy to Zomato.
Swiggy is very very fraud company order lena ke bad order bhi nhi deti hai or customer ke money cut kr leti hai or money refund nhi karti hai or customers se misbehave karte hai isse better facilities hme zomato se milti hai vo customers ko full support krte hai or har problem ko ache se solve karte hai Isliye aj zomato company online order me best h
"I placed the order at 3:55, And Swiggy delivery time was 25 mins. I checked after 25 mins and the delivery time is increased to 35 more minutes. So basically I am receiving my food after an hour from ordering. So, I raised a conversation as where is my order and talked to Customer care representative. They told me that there is some problem with delivery partners vehicle.    Isn’t Swiggy checking that the time is increasing ? And provide me another Delivery person ?    I told her to cancel the order since it is showing 35 more minutes. To which she replied that I have to pay cancellation fee.      So I have to pay for Swiggy’s fault.  Swiggy is showing delivery in 25 mins, Not being able to deliver on the time they provide. And I have to pay for it ?  If It would have me shown me an hour at the beginning I would have ordered from somewhere else.  Also I contacted restaurant they said the food is prepared from last 10 mins. So I should accept the food which was prepared 45 mins ago ? Isn’t it gonna get cold ?  Worst experience from Swiggy."
"I am writing this genuine review regarding my recent order. Yesterday I had ordered 2 cakes for my niece birthday, while they came to deliver my brother couldn’t pick the phone because of some emergency, they just cancelled the order with 100% cancellation charge. When he called again they didn’t respond. Again same day in the evening, I had to order the same items from same restaurant and after that too neither restaurant nor Swiggy respond to my afternoon order. It seems I have been cheated paid twice for the same item. Really worst service, will never go for this food delivery platform."
Too wrost service never forget  Its total cheat of customer.  Never order for this app.  Too wrost to wrost services
"Swiggy is a fraudulent app who delivers expired/near expiry products and then never accept it's mistake and never make a refund. My orderid was order Id 192109828366170 of Dec5, 2024 and I spite of complaining to customer support, grievance officer and it's ceo, they never turned up. Plz stop using swiggy and instead use Amazon, Flipkart, BBasket which has customer friendly support system."
Nice delivary time to time verry fast sarvice and verry fast delivery ty swiggy ....................
"Disastrous Experience - Late Delivery & Unjustified Cancellation Fee ""I recently had a terrible experience with Swiggy. My order was significantly delayed, arriving much later than the estimated delivery parter sign. This resulted in cold and unappetizing food. To make matters worse, when I attempted to cancel the order due to the excessive delay, I was charged an exorbitant cancellation fee."
"I have two bad experiences this year back to back, though I am customer for consistently 5 yrs of swiggy.  1) I had ordered Amul ice-cream of 1 litre for first time from food delivery platform and a packet of chicken, which they misdelivered to some wrong place and then on repeated calling, i received my order in worst condition, imagine liquid for of icecream and thrashed chicken, no customer service support/compensation/ guilty for same from instamart.I had also mailed regarding same.  2) I needed swimming goggles urgently so I searched on Google and found to have in stock of swiggy instamart so I ordered same with walnuts and other 2 products amounting Rs.873, my order has been placed, money deducted and then it showed i will receive delivery in 11 minutes, later after 15 minutes i recieved call from swiggy executive telling me that the items are out of stock hence you please cancel your order, I asked question if it isn't available in your stock you cancel by your end and refund my money but this time I want to talk your manager or team leader.He refunded me only Rs.566(that's what showing on swiggy app). Again I called their customer support service centre and requested to refund my full amount.  My opinion is Zepto, Blinkit, minutes of Flipkart is far better than swiggy instamart.They don't value customer's & can't manage large quantity of customers"
They are very bad at coordination and no help arrives from their end.They made very loose ends and have very poor management.Also their cancellation policy is poor.
Yesterday I order 1034/- food  Order get cancelled by them and now no money back also .  No proper response and Compensation  Acchey log nahi hai  Garib ka paisa khyaa
I had ordered food and within 10 sec cancelled as per rules /policy. I get message I Hv been charged whole amount. When I went for help they said we cannot help and then called their BPO kept me on hold. At 11 pm I am with no food as well as money lost. I said your delivery person come 10 min late then there is no swiggy process but customer abide the rule still been charged. This was my worst experience and I will never use swiggy app and deleted
"I have experienced unprofessional and inadequately trained support from Swiggy. My order number 160070167064563, placed on November 27, 2023, was canceled because the delivery partner refused to deliver to my location. I have reached out multiple times through your email and chat support requesting the deduction of my cancellation fee for future orders. Since last year, I have been unable to place any orders due to this outstanding cancellation fee. Ultimately, the email support team responded by directing me to review the cancellation terms, which I find to be a very irresponsible reply. Consequently, I have submitted a complaint to the National Consumer Forum."
"I had an extremely disappointing experience with Swiggy. My food was not delivered, yet I was charged the full amount due to so-called ""cancellation charges."" It's frustrating to be penalized for something that wasn't my fault. No updates, no support, and no resolution. This kind of service is unacceptable. I trusted Swiggy to deliver, but instead, I’m left without food and out of pocket. Definitely reconsidering ever using this app again."
Unnecessary discussion earning money unnecessary penalty.show weekly offer monthly offer not provided company policy.dealy incentive not provided.  Zomato is batter option. not good swiggy vary bad wearing company policy
I ordered on swiggy? Order cancelled without any intimation?for me swiggy is fraud ?zomoto is much batter option
"For a burnt item with value of rs~25+ proportional platform charges of rs~1.9, I was handed over a ""refund"" and since they didnt disclose the amount I had to find it myself and it was a very ""generous"" rs 6.  After opening another ticket and~10 minutes, they offered a further refund of rs 19, totalling to rs 25.  But the very next day, I recieved a mail saying the refund has been cancelled and all that could be done is to rate the restaurant.  I appealed the claim on mail and the swiggy app itself, but they couldnt help as the refund is still showing as ""processing"" on their end.  Approving a refund and subsequently cancelling it a day later is absolute scumbag behavior."
Hi  I really don't know why swiggy is charging full cancellation amount. I cancelled the order in just 7 min whereas my order delivery time was 58 min. When I raised the query the support person replied that this is our policy. Totally unfair.  I am not going to use swiggy in future for sure and also I will give this review to my family and friends.
Why swiggy has not mentioned that the cancellation fee is 100% this is so dissatisfied  I don’t like In the next time i never order anything from swiggy this is full of nonsense and i also Suggest my friends or family they don’t order anything by Swiggy.
I had a very bad experience yesterday.i ordered some grocery items received the items on time.but then I saw that 1 kg of potatoes received was rotten fully.when I send an email on returning the product they replied that they don't have the return policy .on this product.i received it yesterday evening and the smell was horrible.
"Request to all Never Never Never buy anything from Swiggy, I ordered 3Plate mendu Vada and Sandwich from Shakti Dosa@335paid online after one hour I received my delivery in only 2pic of Mendu vada was there and Sandwich only, So I draft a Mail to Swiggy they raised a ticket complaint number and assured me that my issue will get resolved within 24hour but after 3days I m writing this review and I have not received any feedback from Swiggy side."
I have ordered a food from swiggy & that food came to me unboiled & portion was not justified.asking for refund..but they were not responding..
"Extremely bad experience at swiggy. My husband had placed an order worth 750, prepaid from swiggy. The delivery executive called once when he reached our address and my husband was unable to pick his call. Neither did he call again nor did he ring our door bell and with in a minute swiggy cancelled our order. No customer care number of swiggy to reach out to them and no refund policy, it's like being looted. Would they do this if the order was cash on delivery"
"I accidentally clicked on a different address when placing an order and immediately updated the address, called the delivery agent before his pickup and elaborated him the new address and he deliberately ended up reaching out to the old address which I told him is incorrect. Sent online delivery instructions too but they took my order and my money both. I contacted the customer support and it was not helpful at all. I need my refund ASAP"
Swiggy instamart has no refund/exchange policy. I have faced problems few times. Order wisely and carefully because later they just refuse to help.
"I recently had an unfortunate experience with Swiggy. I mistakenly placed order to my friend address and canceled it in 5 minutes and I found out that I was not eligible for a refund. While I understand that policies are in place for a reason, the lack of flexibility and customer support in this situation was disappointing.Mistaken can be happen sometimes but while speaking with customer support they are not even helpful . I need my money back Rs-639"
1Worst app I see ever  I ordered a cake from swiggy order timing is 20 minutes after 20 minutes the order will out of stock and customer care say that meri galti nahin hai swiggy walon ki galti haio  Do not order in swiggy app that's why I am saying that swiggy is worst app  all customer care recording send all social media
"I have ordered 6 items from insta mart Swiggy 1 item I have received defected  The lid of jar is not closing they have provided me defected jars and I m continuously calling Swiggy daily they are making fool that wait for 24 hrs but it has been 10 days I have not received any refund coupon from their end  One of their employee Bhavna giving false information  I have all recordings and screenshots  Pls be aware  Really disgusting  Their employees are not connecting call to senior management, saying that there is no senior management here  Don’t know how they are working  Really fake money wastage and defective items"
"Food not getting delivered on time , packing issues , cheating and misleading adds, support is pathetic"
Swiggy fast delivery in home Time delivery and hot food Swiggy is best all sarvice .....................
"""DO NOT TRUST SWIGGY!  I am beyond frustrated with Swiggy. This isn't just a one-time issue—I've had multiple experiences where Swiggy took my money, never delivered my order, and ignored my calls. Every time, the delivery driver refuses to pick up or respond, and then the order just disappears. It's like they take your money and vanish. I genuinely feel cheated, and it’s happened far too often for it to be a coincidence. Swiggy has proven they can't be trusted, and it's nothing short of fraud. Don’t make the mistake I did—avoid Swiggy at all costs. There are plenty of reliable alternatives out there!"""
Instamart delivers itmes which are about to expire in 2 to 3 days...this is our regular experience...  We ordered tofu which is 3 months old and about to expire in 4 days
It’s already been a hour since I place my order and I still have not received it and on call they are telling if I wish I can cancel my order. After waiting for almost an hour they are saying no delivery partner near by my kids are almost asleep hungry. Pathetic experience. U cannot rely on this app
"They cancelled the food from their end and not returned my amount, customer care didn't help me and not returned my amount"
I ordered a platter for 1175 rupees when the delivery time showed as 70 mins but on placing the order the delivery time changed to 85 mins. I had children hungry & waiting for food. Hence when I cancelled for this reason Swiggy charged me full cancellation of 1175 & I was told they cannot refund due to changes in their policy? Is this a company to trust who were earlier renowned for their efficiency & is this the company now for whom one would subscribe for their ipo? Please forward to as many people as possible.
"I and my sister always used to order food and groceries from Swiggy food delivery and instamart. They started delivering wrong orders, burnt food, Less quantity, Spoilt food. Whenever I complain about it to their customer service, they always say we cant refund or replace the item, just rate the restaurant. and we are'swiggy one' members. we both have almost got loss of around 4-5000 rupees. Wont ever use swiggy and I won't recommend."
Today I meet very bad experience in Swiggy mujhe se galti se order pe click hogaya i online checking ke cash on delivery he ke nhi and they directly accept order jab mujhe order cancel kar va na tha q ke vo galti se hogaya to unlog ne mujhe charges dene ka bola mere next order par ke aap Abhi cancel kari ge to next order par charge pay kar na pade ga .  It’s very poor experience i never going to order on swiggi again they want us ke aap cancel nhi kar sakte but in case by mistake order hogaya ho to fir bhi charges dena padega
This app is good food is delicious please order any food items in this app..  This app is so good.........
I ordered sweets for Puja at my house as I was busy in preparation for Puja. But my order was cancelled by delivery agent saying that his call was not received. How can I pick the call as I was busy in preparation. If address is given correct he should simply deliver the order at prescribed address. But my order was cancelled and money was kept by Swiggy saying cancellation fee. This was very disappointing. My Puja ceremony was also ruined. Very bad service.
"This is a worst and cheating app. They are acting as a scammers, receiving the orders through mobile app and their fraud delivery agents/partners are not delivering the food items to their valuable customers. I ordered the food from abroad to my family but not delivered the food items by their fraud delivery agent/partners. when I approached to the customer service, their irresponsible reply is that the delivery agent is cancelled your order so we are taking your money for cancellation fee. Now their final conclusion is that the fraud delivery partner stolen my food and swiggy stolen my money. this is the biggest scam happening in swiggy. Also their customer care team is such a irresponsible and immature team doesn't have any sense how to handle their customers, who lost their money and how to resolve the issues. Their principle is to do the robbery from poor people. Already they are doing the same thing with people of India and now they started doing with NRI's from abroad as well."
I have order a paneer cheese pizza from swiggy and they have delivered a burnt pizza and I have a request but no one is bothered about it. Worst service by swiggy and i suggest don't buy any product through swiggy. My 244 rupees been waste and I am unhappy with the service
"Every time I order from insta art I receive spoilt products  Mile, fruits, veggies curd flowers garland ext ext  Sab big da hua…….  I am happy to have a products delivery pickup center in our area"
Its a worst app where people those who are paying online are cheated by the delivery boy & Swiggy won't bother to refund the money of the customer Whereas complaints have been register but no proper reply & initiative taken. They are supporting the culprits. I have stop ordering in instamart & food from Swiggy. I request people to boycott Swiggy. It is the duty of delivery boy to deliver the food if the payment is done.
Swiggy make fake promises nd money will taken from customers nd customer service care was useless there don’t know anything just passing the calls to all
My order was undelivered and I contacted customer service agent for refund. There was no help at all from the customer service agent in regards to my issue and the case was closed without any solution and without providing any justification . I was so disappointed with the swiggy customer service support.
I mistakenly pressed order in this delivery and searched for cancellation button but it was not there so I asked swiggy help and support to cancel my order within 1 min but they told I can cancel the order but I have to pay 100 percentage of the amount for nothing when I started the help chat the restaurant didn't accept the order while talking only the accept the order this is really an bas delivery app
Pathetic service diwali ke din bhi chori karte hai sweets redeliver karne me rote hai lol order cancel kar dete hai without prior information to us 1500 ka order tha literally 2 min me cancel kar diya
I placed an order online on swiggy Mart Bangalore a week ago for two items worth Rs 316 but after sometime I got a call from the delivery person that for your address I cannot deliver the same. I live in tatanagar Bangalore near hebbal and location/ address was available in my online account and chosen correctly. When I spoke to the store persons they said your order is cancelled and there is no refund of any money. I wrote e-mails to swiggy customer who wanted order no etc. I looked for the order no on my online account but found nothing they had erased everything therefore I gave them the time and items ordered with screenshot of location and address but there was no reply. I have a debit card tranfer to swiggy from my bank acct.Therefore I escalated my query for refund to the highest consumer care executive but no reply has been received till today. I therefore conclude that this company is deceptive and indulges in acts of moral turpitude and doesn't mind cheating it's customer. I advise any purchaser online to keep away from buying from them as they don't have the least regard to their customers  Dasharathi KR  Sr cit/ retd jt dir CPRl bng
Called me when I am in important office meeting and this Swiggy service people canceled order  Actually after cancellation delivery person must should return items undelivered to restaurant  But in this it was not done  I reached restaurant yesterday also today also items not returned to restaurant and items were taken to the house of delivery boy as Swiggy confirmed in conference call with me and delivery person and restaurant  So this is cheating and negligence of Swiggy side to earn easy money and no control or track of delivery items and no strict instructions to delivery team to return if undelivered to customer  Regards  Yelamanchili Ganapathi
Swiggy ads a lot irritating everytime ads came. I uninstall the app after again ads came literally is very bad service. And this ads a lot irritating. My work stopped sudden when ads came. What will I do for swiggy ads. Don't show again in my phn I'm not interested.
"On 25th Oct 2024, I have placed an order of Ice cream from Swiggy for my mother’s birthday. Swiggy delivery partner claimed that he called me, which I never received. So, he did not deliver the order of 800 rupees. And now Swiggy is not refunding the amount, stating it was my mistake as there deliver partner could not find my house, where other deliver agents have and had delivered food and other parcels easily. If he couldn’t get through my number, he could have asked for the address from anyone, they would have guided him.  Par logon ko time pe khaana khilaane waale mere 800 rupaye khaanaa chahatein hai. They have ruined my birthday surprise and also ruined the trust, which I have showed in Swiggy.  Thanks to you, I am switching to Zomato."
"I had a smooth experience with Swiggy. The variety of restaurant options and easy payment made ordering convenient. The food was excellent, well-packaged, and arrived warm, with good hygiene and safety during delivery.  However, the real-time tracking wasn't accurate, causing confusion about the delivery time, which was slightly delayed. Overall, Swiggy delivered a great experience but could improve on real-time updates."
Very bad service. World top most fruad. Swiggy give 40k charges and not give me refund. Very very bad service. Almost 1 year complated but issue is not resolved.
Why charge Rs 75 for a distance of 1.5km. The order is being delivered in two wheeler and not in a limo. Two wheeler mileage per litre is between 40 to 50kms so why charge 75 rs for 1.5 km. This is day light looting of the customer. Absolute injustice . I hope the management takes this seriously and reviews its delivery charge policy .Upto 2km it has to be free delivery or Rs 25 only.
Worsted delivery company in swiggiy  Don't install to anyone  Customer was very un respect fellow s  My experience worsted worsted worsted worsted worsted worsted worsted worsted don't order in swiggiy
"Their delivery is within 10 minutes. But if they mess up - which they do 90% of the time, return pickup or replacement will take hours while customer's money is stuck with no refund. THIS IS THEIR SO CALLED'USP'.  SHAMELESS people!"
We ordered food and the delivery boy without even approaching for delivery cancelled the order. We don't know the reason for this. 5 minutes prior to this order we received another order from other restaurant where in that delivery joy could reach us and why this order got cancelled. When we wrote to swiggy the said we will not refund the money. There is no justification for the cancelation.  They have taken rs. 307/- better order on COD and cautio
Have ordered food and provided an address to deliver and provided alternate number to call. Delivery partner didnt even try to check the address given and not even called the alternate number and cancelled the order. Swiggy support team deducted full amount as the cancellation fee and didnt even provided proper support. Illegal way to do business.
"Swigy, I found your service very bad. This time I am not able to complete the order from you. You should have told us the same time. I was waiting for so long in the room that my food was coming but at the last moment"
"I ordered from Swiggy today from a restaurant, and the food I received had Hair in it. I called Swiggy customer care and the best solution they offered me was ₹250 for a health court violation that is completely illegal.. instead of taking strict action against the restaurant, Swiggy told me that they are only delivery service, and they will not take a strict action against the restaurant, and that it will not repeat again. But I assume that the CEO of Swiggy being such a big businessman, does not have an inch of social responsibility.health code violation is a very serious violation and must have the power to bypass all the protocols and the procedures that are required to file a complaint and a strict action must have been taken right away. But Swiggy doesn’t seem to care once the food is delivered they kind of dust their hands, and they don’t care about you anymore after that."
"Never received help through any channel. it's totally your luck if you get a proper ordered food with all items. Swiggy don't take any action but take full additional rates, surge rate, packaging charges and so on. pethatic support"
This is the third time that horrible vegetables are delivered by Swiggy  Repeated complaints but no action taken  Only refund given
"I recently placed an order, but unfortunately, the delivery partner refused to deliver to my location due to the rain. I tried reaching out to both the support team and the delivery partner multiple times, but he was uncooperative throughout the process.  To my surprise, the order has now been canceled, and I’ve been charged a full cancellation fee. This doesn’t seem fair as the cancellation wasn’t on my part."
"So i ordered kfc and i had to go somewhere immediately and i was in a conversation with the, customer care person and it was one hour the customer care did not answer and after some time we answered he told that he can't  cancel the order as the food is making wtf i was waiting but he did not responded to my question and plus there was extra charges on my next order i am sorry but i am nt going to order from swiggy the worst app"
"Extremely annoyed and disappointed with Swiggy’s service. They cancelled my order twice this year without any update. I kept waiting for almost 2 hours both the times and had to follow up myself. The first time they told me that the food item had finished but was showing up on the website so the order got cancelled. The second time I had to call up the delivery partner after a long wait who asked me to cancel the order as he said that the restaurant is now closed and he was already asleep. These incidents show that they have zero coordination with their restaurant partners and no arrangement of informing the customers. The third time yesterday, I placed the order for sweets for puja and since the time of delivery was showing as almost 1 hour I immediately cancelled within a second but now their customer service was active and they said that I have to pay a cancellation fee of Rs 356 for sweets which costed Rs 380. Reason given: food wastage and delivery partners time. I Dont know how within a second, sweets got packed and the delivery partner arrived at the restaurant location. Difficult to digest!!  Never mind I had to wait for an hour to receive the sweets and missed by puja. This shows how they harass their customers  I would suggest Swiggy to improve their service as there are other delivery partners in the market who offer better service to their customers.  I will give them a zero rating if possible."
Team handling customer care don’t respect the customer and are not professionals  Swiggy value for customers is going down…..
"My wife ordered The Park Avenue Luxury Grooming Collection(8-in-1 Combo) including the bag, which was a gift for our wedding annivesary to me, unfortunately only 7 items were there and when she raised a complaint they replaced it and next day ie today when I opened the kit for shaving the after shave lotion was only 20% rest has been used then when we raised a compalint again they say why did you all open it and use it on that note I wrote to them unless and untill I dont shave I am not going to use the shaving lotion they say we cant help. Moreover everyday we order our grocery small things from Instamart and this is the service they give."
"I ordered @1:28 PM and I received my order @3:00PM When I called at customer care executive, she is too rude and do the misbehave with me.  When I call back and want to talk the manager,  manger denied to talk to me.My order was completely spoiled. And the customer care executive was talking to me very rudely. It seems as if I am asking for food for free."
"Had a bad experience.i ordered food through irctc swiggy entered pnr etc , clicked on option Vijayawada station etc but they arrived early but my train is yet to reach the mentioned station.Therefore  they said they can't wait nd cancelled my order with no refunds ."
"Do not order from Swiggy I repeat do not order , if you want to donate your money to swiggy 5hen you can go for it , there delivery guy do not deliver you food , cancel your order and they will take your money stating this is there policy, they won't give you food you ordered and also take your money pathetic app..."
This is total fraud company . there executive not deliver the order and cancel there own and company take money and executive take your food . you will not get any thing.
"The app was not having option to select location, hence I had to enter it manually but the swiggy App PICKED UP WRONG LOCATION, which I could makeout only after the location was displayed after placing order. Hence called the customer care n they deny to reach my home address and insisted me to reach their location 12KM far from my home at 11:30PM in the night. The customer care agents carelessly kept arguing that it's my mistake. But I had typed the address carefully along with the area pin code. They were not ready to refund neither deliver my order. They kept this argument going for 90+ mins. It's so disgusting to be empty stomach and fight for getting the food or refund. Customer care executive KHUSHi n his manager both asks me to reach the location shown in their map n pickup the order around mid night."
I specially put a note telling that’s I don’t want capsicum in any dishes I ordered but they still put capsicum and send. And the customer care doesn’t respond except by telling me to write a mail. Which doesn’t process at all. I called 4-5 times and the call is disconnected every time including the senior department.
"Worst App ever, swiggy instamart. Damaged product received - Bajaj pygmy mini fan worth 1007₹ . Contact help on swiggy, still hopelessly they say they cannot refund / replace the product .  My 1007₹ are wasted. The product can't even be repaired. On top of that they don't call you.  Before instamart i used swiggy for roti & mutton. Again rotis were staled & black totally which can make you sick. Till now all my experience with swiggy was worst. Don't buy anything from this app."
"I am Gowrish(mobile number: 924682xxxx) has experience 3rd time with Swiggy delivering damaged products. Its has become a regular practice for SWIGGY to delivery damaged products to the customers and their customer service is pathetic. I ordered ice creams and they have just sent a fully damaged items and on complaining they are saying they can't help. Neither they are refunding the amount nor send the other items. Who gave them the right to loot the customers? Its a lesson for all of us to stop relying on these online stores.  They just looted Rs 115 just like that and not responding.  If I lost Rs 115 today, like me may be another 1000 customer experienced in Hyderabad alone. So around 1 lakh they are earning out of damaged products that are useless to the customers.  I am taking this time to request request others not to fall in their trap and order online. If you face any such experience don't leave here, please log a complaint in consumer forum which I will be doing it now.  Thanks."
Payment was made from our side and there was a system error from their side when we called to solve the issue the support guy said to make double payment or pay cancellation charges rather than looking into the matter he was yapping some shhit and even the delivery guy told him that we have made payment yet he was not ready to listen . Very rude and unacceptable behaviour . Swiggy needs to change their bullcrap employees .
"Cheated by Swiggy DINE OUT APP.  FIRST they will Lure you by showing discount .  Then we booked a Table, while we were already at the Restaurant so as to claim the offers as shown in discounts.  At the time of Payment the Discounts were NO LONGER available.  IT WAS REALLY very very humiliating as  We really felt cheated. Should have used the other Apps like Eazy Diner or Zomato.  When called to Customer Service, he appeared to be very unprofessional, uneducated & rude employee.  He just kept ranting one line that since we have used the APP for Booking a TABLE, so the OFFERS / DISCOUNTS are no longer available.  BE CAREFUL , DO NOT FALL INTO THEIR TRAP .  With this attitude you are going to lose your customers.  COMPLAINT No. 187077136311465"
Ordered an ice cream from instamart and they served half box of ice cream and when you ask for replacement and their executive can’t offer a solution.  Customer service and quality have degraded a lot
"I ordered food through Swiggy, i got my food with a very long strand of hair, i tried to rwach Swiggy to complain, they don't have a customer service number, i email, thw replied and ask me to upload a picture which i did, and they never reply me , i ended up sleeping with hi ger that day. If i find a long strand of haor, that will sugg3st that the restaurant is not clean and maybe have been selling to its customer unhygiene food. I will poat the pucture on facebook and youtube"
"This morning I ordered 5 ltr Safola gold oil and it said 1 ltr free. They never delivered the 1 ltr free and when I complained I was offered 50 rs. So what this chor company is doing, is taking the free oil and selling it and then offering Rs 50 as compensation. I am going to complain in the consumer forum as well. Never use this chor company. Horrible service and only steal ir money"
"Worst customer service, uneducated rude employees, who doesn't know to analyze the root cause. I hate swiggy and will never ever gonna use it again. Its not the money but you have hurt my emotions. I had ordered food (dinner) on my mom's birthday, which never reached us, and later when checked app it was canceled without our knowledge, reason being delivery person was not able to reach, since I was out of city I had left a clear instructions on delivery instructions with my mother's mobile no. For contact but delivery person had missed to read the instructions and we dint receive any call and order was canceled and is charged. My mom had to cook and eat late night.  But I had ordered cake the same afternoon with the same instructions which was delivered on time.  When I complained about it swiggy refused to even listen to my complaint and only response was we cannot refund according to our policy, I don't need your refund. Swiggy is more focusing on refund rather then investigating the root cause.  With this attitude you are going to lose your customers.  Me and my family members and friends have decided to uninstall swiggy and opt zomato or any other app.. since we have lot of options available."
"I booked a buffet offer for 2 through swiggy dineout at Westin Hotel Kolkata , The coast for 2, was 2500 also there was 30% off..which I availed on pre-book offer as per their app listing, also the app showed me to pay the bill amount, I got mail also , so I paid the bill full, for a hassle free dine..once i reached at the restaurant, I was offered a table, After finishing, I was asked to pay bill, but I said I paid the full amount, then there answer was, why you paid before coming and eating, this was there rude reply, first of all, then they said, it was swiggy fault, talk to swiggy, we have asked to remove this offer, they are not doing that..they they insisted me to pay more the same amount..with some discount, so I ended up paying double.also with harassment, I want to file a case and want compensation..with my refund amount..which I was charged double"
Service is good faster delivery and nice food delivery boys excellent.
Service is very fast and give the information is very depth and its user friendly sevice....order delivery on time
"Swiggy Genie delivery partners expect you to speak in Kannada since you live in Karnataka. They have the audacity to ask you why are you staying in Karnataka if you do not know the language. Further, they expect you to give them directions in Kannada when the map clearly shows the delivery address with the pin. Swiggy really needs to train their delivery team on communication and customer service and definitely manners!"
"Pathetic app. The agents are never ob time. They are busy delivering orders from other apps. Food delivery is always delayed, customer agents will not help with cancelation infact they will also not let you rate them. One agent mentioned they were trained to keep customer ls on long hold in the meantime push agent to deliver faster. I ordered from a QSR restaurant 5 mins from my place, the order was delayed by more than 30 mins, items were missing, food was cold. Even the customer escalation team was of no help. If you cant help swiggy then don't call. I have better things in life than explaining the same issue to your agents 2-3 times a day only to get a response we have escalated this. We all know this statement makes no sense else deliveries would have been on time!"
I placed an order with Instamat and the delivery partner's refused to deliver to my doorstep. Swiggy charges fir delivery but delivery partner refuses delivery. This is a total fraud runned by the company and there is no way to complain. Sad services being provided.
"Worst experience, delivery partner cancelled the order infront of me and they have charged cancellation fee  My request never addressed"
"Had ordered a pizza which was received in worst condition, Was not in condition to eat. Made a complaint on real time but the complaint was closed without any information and without any action. Why should I pay for a worst order. Chat bot doesn't reply as per requirement. No direct customer service  I appreciate such a worst service received from Swiggy.  I thought it's a brand now and will not tolerate any customer's dissatisfaction but no response received.  Manish Kumar  9899356851"
I didn't see worst customer support than swiggy today I order thali and the rotis were missing in it and they were not even replying
"Hi , I am Vishal working in Marriott. I was ordered biryani on 24th sep. Then swiggy delivery boy called me tell me I had reached on your destination. But he is not there. I was told him then he told me it's your fault you are giving wrong address. And then I got call from swiggy customer service then she told me she cancelled my order charge panlty . While I had got my order a lot of time my was saved in my profile ."
"We ordered food from Swiggy and the main food item was missing even after full payment upfront. The customer service in Swiggy refused to help us out and behaved quite rudely, I must say. My kids were starving on the dining table and my younger one even fainted from hunger all because of Swiggy. Swiggy has horrible customer service."
"They will not send items which is in bulk order , they’re dont have refund option  If delivery boy takes order , then you don’t get back your amount you spent"
"Food was incomplete. Swiggy did not helped me .  i ordered 2 shahi thali but company provided me only 1 thali.  i was engaged in calling at customer care since 10.51 to 12.15 during my 7to 8 calls but no solution recived . Some times putted on hold and some times call was disconnected by executives and 1 time at my last call executived treatrd me like a blind person all the calls were on auto recorded mode in my phone .  First times when i complained , executive commited me for 2 fresh new thalis but i recived only one and that was also incomplete as the sweets portion was empty.  i suggest to everyone to do not order any food from Bala ji pack and go as they are very poor in quality and standered, i also suggest to do not use swiggy channel for any order as they always creats hactics and makes customer harrash ."
Swiggy's service customer care very poor service merchant close swiggy useless..??
Order not received it’s been 2 hour and people of Swiggy scam you never use Swiggy for ordering the food
"Swiggy is one of worst and fraud company in india, it don't care about customer response. As I ordered food on 18th september 2024 at 3:12 pm. But I didn't get my order and delaying time delivery didn't reached for order to delivery me. So I waited waited finally cancelled my order. They charged my order as cancellation fees of 302rs . there is no refund policy from their end for there mistake. In return they are telling its company cancellation policy. Its a bullshit swiggy is fraudster and cheap company practicing malpracticises breaching trust of customer."
They did a fraud to me such fake app I suggest no one to order from swiggy.they are cheaters.i ordered by mistake but within 2-3 minutes I cancelled the order but swiggy charged by cancellation charges was my order prepared did by order picked up?
"Pathetic service! Placed an order that went incomplete, and a 400 INR penalty was added to my account. Customer support was unhelpful and didn't respond to my concern. Very disappointed with the lack of resolution."
"Today I downloaded the Swiggy Instamart App just to place an urgent order and was very hopeful that I could give what I had ordered to the person leaving for Kerala very early in the morning. But, unfortunately it was the worst experience I ever had with any of the Online Applications. I placed an order at 9:14 pm and it showed me delivery within 26 mins and I was absolutely fine with it. But, at 10 pm I receive a call from them asking to cancel the order as the delivery partner goofed up by taking my order and delivering it to some other address. When I refused to cancel my booking and asked them to deliver to me what I had ordered, they said they'll try and reassign another delivery partner which they eventually did but, despite that I did not receive my order until 10:45 pm and finally, they themselves cancelled my order. How unprofessional, unreliable and disgusting customer service!!"
There is literally insects egg on my ginger ale can it like they jt removed from the dustbin or it jt there store room is a mess
"I order on swiggy today at 1:30 PM the delivery partner wasn’t assigned for 30 mins. Once order was picked up 30 mins later, the order was clubbed with another order almost 30mins + away. total time for this order to be revived was more than an hour. I still haven’t received my order and waiting. when i placed this order, the time said 20-25 mins. clearly the timing were incredibly wrong. very bad experience with swiggy. i do not recommend, please use zomato. ??"
Swiggy refuses to refund and blocks your complaint with an email address? Driver ate half the food from both orders. This is not the first time and is becoming a routine for this company. It needs to be corrected. How is this not immediately corrected on the basis of theft?
I Like it Swiggy Services top quality service. Awesome Delivery Quickly. I Recommend Other people you can use opportunity.
"They deliver expired food items and there is no system of reversal of amount charged since there is no one to listen to your grievance! They do have a so-called ""help""  which is name sake only since there you get an automated response and nothing much comes out of it.  When you write mail on the customer service mail id, they just say sorry and don't provide refund even for expired items.  This is happening for the second time. Horrible experience to say the least."
Ordered food at 1330 for my kid and wife. After 2 hours at 1530 order is cancelled by swiggy for no reason. So pathetic service did not expect from such a big so called customer centered company.  And you contact them they only talk about refund and no empathy.
"I was charged for the whole order value for cancelation of my order within a minute. If they charge the delivery charges alone it makes sense, however they don’t have the right to charge for Vendor’s value in addition to their delivery charges. It is illegal. I had complained to Swiggy Support, but no action taken. It’s pathetic service.  Such a bad app and worst people  Best suggestion that people using this app plzzz stop immediately it’s just a scam"

I had complained to Swiggy Support, but no action taken. It's pathetic service.  Would like to add to my issue stated earlier. I n response to my feedback, I was asked my contact number, when shared, someone called and pretended to be from Swiggy Corporate and claimed to initiating the refund along with penalty of Rs. 1000. He turned out to be a fraudster as he was trying to steal Rs. 20.000 by pretending to issuing refund voucher, for which he asked me to maintain minimum balance to get the refund. Please don't fall into these plays. Well, I ended the call asking him to either refund to the medium of payment or issue credit to my Swiggy Account.  Thank you Mitha for alerting the same.  Bottomline, this website or app is driven by fraudsters and the mobile number +91705020xxxx I got this call is from Bihar. Don't pick this call."
The delivery person replace my sandwich with some low quality sandwich except i didn't notice even there customer care is useless
I asked veg fried rice but swiggy delivered noodles. It is cheating by instead of returning the money they are converting to coupon. False promise that coupon validity for 1 month instead it is valid for 15 days only. Please keep away from swiggy... Best is home making food.
I share my honest review for swiggy I am long time user for swiggy but I face one problem on this platform I always ordered on swiggy but his service was not good his order always delay and delivery and order prepared time was too long customer only wait his order and his delivery partner not good not educated people I am very disappointed his service
They don't have control on the delivery agents.  I have faced delivery partner running out of with my food without delivering.  Swiggy Partners cannot do anything despite of complaints.
"They claim to deliver groceries at your door in record time and more or less do so. But once the delivered product goes bad/gets damaged etc. there is no system of reversal of charges since there is no one to listen to your grievance! They DO have a so-called ""help""  which is there in name only since there you get an automated response and nothing much comes out of it."
Third class service. Why delivered Chiken when paid for Mutton? . Third class service. Why you have charged for mutton and delivered chicken?
I ordered and waited 1 hour in midnight and then they cancelled and refunded. Just close delivery when you are not avail to deliver..
Delivery guy had bad behaviour.. paid online for the service and delivery guy is asking money again... now I am deleting the account of Swiggy won’t use services.. VEry very poor service
"Be aware , third class service. Compromising customers health by empaneling with cheap vendors like Kerala Restaurant etc and supplying stalled food. Absolutely no ethics. They are trying to make money through unethical practices etc. Swiggy should ashamed of themselves"
So bad experience on swigg service  I m not use next time this app bocz no any good policy with customer just only decision money unnecessary
"Swiggy Instamart is misleading and does not fulfill its promises. It claims that your order will be delivered in 8 minutes, but that’s completely inaccurate. Swiggy failed to deliver on time, and I regret placing the order. I ended up canceling it after waiting for an hour. The delivery partner was also very unprofessional and rude, even telling me that I was lying and to hang up the phone. This was an extremely disappointing experience. Such a bad experience please don't go for order anything from swiggy Instamart."
"I have ordered Fried rice with chilly pannerordered # 183214071588115item price 240. I added special instructions for the same.

Swiggy never for customer service only for payment everytime delay and say sorry delivery boy have two orders for delivery I have ordered khamari roti now think what happened when we received
Ordered at Janakpuri Delhi & after a long time the delivery person called to pick up the food from road & refused to come to the office floor .& behaved very badly.
Pathetic company and pathetic people. They had delivered all damaged product to me.Its a Rakhi festival snd whole milk was stake it curdled other products were old and expired.When I messaged them they didn't bother to look into this.I will request everyone to leave SWIGGY..these people are chor a theif..logo ka paisa maar rahe hai..this company needs a closure now...Chi on them
Taken time nearly 1 hour to assign the delivery person and reached food after 1.30 hour.very bad.I loose interest. Very very bad service
I have ordered 2 Sweetlime juice from FIRANGI FALOODA Pragati Nagar in via swiggy for 200 rupees. But I received soured tasted sweelime juice I can't even drink single sip. Waste of money don't order via swiggy firangi falooda will give you very bad tasted juice.
I ordered 2 plate if idli and 1plate of idly vada but received only 1 plate of idli and 1plate of idli vada after that I raised a complaint that 1 item is missing but they are not ready to refund
Worst and pathetic service. I had placed a order at 12 pm at Mani dum biryani Kalyan nagar. Not only received a wrong order but asked to wait for another 2 hrs to receive my replacement order. Swiggy team has just one word to say sorry for what happened. The delivery person hasn't checked the order before pickup. It is so embarassing in front of my guests. These people don't even call back with any tracking update and the chat is automated with general replies which solves no purpose. I will never recommend swiggy to anyone.  I feel Zomato is well organised.
"Pls don't order from swiggy instamart, they are not trustworthy people. I order few items, one of my item wa missing. I talk to them on help option, even after three days they didn't refund my money or deliver the missing item, then i email them and they deny to refund my money. Zepto and blinkit are much better then them they process the refund within an hrs, so i request pls dont order from swiggy intamart"
I am ordering food usually from swiggy from last 2 year but now there quality as well communication is drastically changed.  I have very bad experience from last 3 times in 1 month as I complaint on there customer care too.  I order for burger king and food which I got is completely cold.messaged on customer care but no solution.2nd time from Belgium waffle ordered for 3 waffle it came soggy again complain no response.yesterday ordered natural icecream and I got milk instead of icecream again complain but got response that it's not there responsibility to deliver icecream so folks it's your hard earned money please don't waste on swiggy or zomato.instead of paying them delivery charges go and get it as it's much cheaper as well u will eat fresh and hot.
"Worst service and worst people in swiggy and they don’t know how to to talk with customer, and they cut the call without asking"
"Today is 11-08-2024, i ordered kfc from swigy, they mentioned time about 20 to 25 min. Firstly they took 50 min to pick the oder from kfc , at 11:28pm my full family is waiting for oder and delivery partner called me and said his bike has no petrol and take ur oder from me.. I was really shocked , when I call swigy help center, they offer me that I can cancel ur oder and they will give me a coupon of 50 Rs for this discomfort to my hole family at 11:35.. now I'm going to delete swigy permanently from my phone.. and I don't recommend swigy to any one"
Delivery Person for Order ID: 18236097032 8988  not only rude doesn't take care to check delivery directions written by customer of Swiggy where the road directions are given in detail by the customer. Please employ people who understands English and can read too. Oye Balle Balle Food is no1.
"I ordered maggie from swiggy. Waited for like 30-40 mimutes and then the delivery boys calls me saying that he dropped the order and asked us to cancel it, instead of replacing it or taking responsibility for the same. I tried contacting executives of swiggy for reporting the incident. Neither did they take the responsibility about the order. Kindly never order from swiggy. Kindly check order id is #182309790069353"
"I’m writing to share my frustrating experience with Swiggy, which might help others make a more informed choice. I recently ordered boondi laddoo but received methi laddoo instead, a significant mix-up. I immediately reported the issue and provided photographic evidence, yet there has been no satisfactory resolution. This is the second time I've faced such negligence from Swiggy without any follow-up or remedy.  Given the lack of effective support and resolution from Swiggy, I strongly recommend considering Zomato instead. My experiences with Zomato have been more reliable, with prompt service and better customer care. Don’t risk your order with Swiggy—choose Zomato for a more dependable food delivery experience."
I have ordered from this app . My location is on 3 rd floor . But delivary boy refuced to giv it on the floor . He has told to come on ground floor .  Very bakkvass
"I had ordered food on Swiggy app on 3 Aug 2024 at 8.00 pm, Order #181665981041816. I kept waiting till 9.30 pm, but my order was not delivered to me & fake delivery status was updated by delivery boy.  After a long wait, around 9.00 pm the delivery boy called me from Swiggy's official phone number saying that I am standing near your house, but when I came out on his request, I did not see him anywhere. On this, when I called him back, he said that I am on the way and am coming to you. Saying this he disconnected the call.  Meanwhile I got a message that your order has been delivered, so I immediately called the delivery boy again to tell him that my order delivery status has been updated wrongly while I have not received my order, but he did not receive the call. I called him several times, but did not get any answer. I contacted customer care several times, but no help was given by swiggy, neither my money is being refunded nor order was delivered.  I want to give advice that Swiggy should implement OTP verification for delivery. So that such frauds do not happen. After this review Swiggy will ask me to drop an email, which I have already done, but no solution has been given."
"Literally worst service ever, I placed my order at 8:30 pm and waited until 11:00 pm, after that I tried to call the delivery partner but he didn't pick up, I tried calling him more that 10 times.  Bad service, won't recommend."
I am installing the app first time there given me offer coupon I order biryani and waiting but Waiting 1hr after my Order canceled in swiggy side and don't give any compensation
"Swiggy Instamart(Malad) sells products close to expiry date. I bought a lotion from them today which has a shelf life of only 1 yr remaining out of the 2 yrs the company provided because it has been with them for a year now and that is the reason they are selling it at a discounted price and they also store it in the fridge. Who stocks lotions in the fridge. #swiggy has done this so that they cant sell products at a lower price keeping by stocking things in the fridge(to increase shelf life) and that is the reason they are giving/selling it at a discount. I called their customer support, Ms. Kajal who acknowleged the fact that the product is old but she says she cannot do anything and cant even exchange or give me a refund as per company policy. I also spoke with the excalation manager, Ms. neha and she too agreed and said as per the company policy she cant do anything. So guys think before you but from #Swiggy Instamart. they cheat customers."
"Dear all,  This is to inform you that I found a mismatch in menu card rates in swiggy app with restaurant actual menu cards. The restaurant name is Apni Rasoi Rohini sector-9. When I want to contact swiggy regarding the same then I came to know that they don't have any customer care no. and also they don't have option to resolve this problem other than to mail. If anyone wants food to order at any point of time and the problem is there then what they can do. Either they order food with the higher price or they have to keep their taste aside and order food to another restaurant. Which have higher rates and pay swiggy to keep them higher on th list. I uploaded the actual menu of the restaurant so please check the rates on swiggy app.  Thanks and regards"
Today we ordered 2 set parotta kurma from geetham restaurant through swiggy app but we received sambar instead of kurma. We informed Swiggy help centers with photos and they said Rs17 will be our refunds so we have to paid Rs240 for parotta+ tax+ service charges etc and we have to eat this parotta with sambar.so no logic of refund from swiggy management really not reliable to order with swiggy anymore.
"Very bad experience with Swiggy Instamart, I ordered for coconut chunks and they came in bad condition (sticky and smelly). After uploading pictures, my conversation was closed without any resolution and then when I mailed the escalation team just said we cannot refund. On asking for a reason, they didn't have any and just kept on saying we cannot refund. Such horrible team Swiggy has got they don't trust customers. Customer should be treated with respect and trust is the most important thing. Swiggy Instamart competitors are better off and I would urge people not to use Swiggy Instamart."
I have ordered grilled chicken on 28/7/2024 at 1.30 pm it was very worst and unable yo eat it.the smell was too bad
Best service and quality. Delivery reached on time. Overall experience one of the best online food service.
Day by rates are increasing what is the problem?  of same order so we should be able to order but not to see the price and cancel the order just see
Swiggy instamart is selling fake products in fmcg. The kind of customer support is pathetic. The response from management is horrible. Product get expiry before the validity.

"Hello team,  I have ordered chicken biryani from kritunga restaurant, instead of biriyani I got tamoto kind of rice and it was so spicy and getting too bad smell.  That to pocket was damaged and there is no chicken pice in the pocket.  I have raised a concern through chat but no response and I have posted in twitter and linked in too.  Which was happened the experience for me I will spread these in my surroundings through social media, and I have posted in all media.  Mr shaikh is a waste and worst fellow he was not ready to listen to the customers query and he was so rude while doing chat through online.  Thanks and regards,  Balaji Yammanuri,"
"Orders if your hotel partner can't deliver , taking money and saying refund in 7 days , stop this nonsense"
Despite a clear address & location details orally some swiggy delivery men do not read it & keep me on the phone engaged directing them from the A2B hotel in M.G Road. Worst was yesterday night delivery man who kept on talking referring to speed breakers on the road which was ludicrous for address location. I had to cut off the phone twice & with a very clear cut instructions several times he had not noticed the hardware shop near my residence & when I asked him why he was not following my instructions & instead listening to to some unknown road users & telling me that hardware stores which I said didn't even exist on the road. With much difficulty I was able to direct him & when I asked him it was me who will know the way to my address better than someone on the road he started abusing me that I was a characterless woman to find fault with him. I was taken aback & told him to get out. WORST WAS AFTER TAKING THE CASH ON DELIVERY HE DIDNT REGISTER MY PAYMENT WITH SWIGGY LEADING TO SWIGGY APP SHOWING THAT I HAD TO PAY FIR THE DELIVERY. WELL AFTER 20 MINUTES OF ME GIVING HIM THE CASH ON DELIVERY HE HADN'T REGISTERED MY CASH PAYMENT. I AKERTED THE SWIGGY CUSTOMER CARE AFTER WHICH THEY CONTACTED HIM & MADE HIM REGISTER MY CASH PAYMENT. DO NOT PAY SWIGGY THROUGH ONLINE AS SONE OF THEIR FRAUD DELIVERY MEN WILL LEAVE WITHOUT DELIVERING OR WITH CASH ON DELIVERY CHECK WHETHER THEIR DELIVERY MEN HAD REGISTERED OUR CASH PAYMENT ONCE WE HAD PAID THEM.
"I ordered ice cream cake, the deliver cake was damaged. After a lots of effort they provide coupons instead of cash"
"Absolute cheats! Yesterday we placed order for chicken TiKKa Biriyani from Rasna Punjab. The Swiggy sent message that. the order on the way. Order no179416672520449 Then we recieved a missed call ..When we tried calling back , he refused to take our call. A message comes that your order cannot be delivered. The amount was Rs 928. They haven’t refunded .. says it is cancellation charges! We did not cancel the order. The delivery boy cheated us and had our food! Do not order from Swiggy. cheated customer."
I have ordered with proper location somehow they could not reach to my location. They cancelled my order and reassured me that they will refund my money even I had a talk with Managers and he also assured me about refunding money back but they did not refund it till date.
"#Swiggy #SwiggyInstamart #patheticCustomerService #NoSupportForKannadaLanguage  Recent order from Swiggy Instamart (Order number: 179300725126693 was a disaster! Despite my excitement to try the service, I faced:    Missing items : Nandu'chicken drumstick    Damaged items: egg, potato, onion      To add insult to injury, the customer support team failed to assist me effectively, and I was shocked to find that they don't support Kannada, my preferred language! In a city like Bengaluru, where Kannada is widely spoken, this lack of support is unacceptable.  I hope Swiggy Instamart takes immediate action to:    Improve order fulfillment accuracy    Enhance packaging to prevent damage    Train customer support to be more empathetic and responsive    Include Kannada language support to cater to local customers      Until then, I'll be forced to explore alternative shopping options that value my language and provide better service. Disappointed and hoping for improvements!"""
"I've had a frustrating experience with the Swiggy food delivery app. Despite numerous discount and promotional codes, I've noticed that Swiggy often charges more than the actual menu price at the restaurant. This feels misleading and unfair to customers who expect to save money with these codes.  Additionally, the hidden fees and inflated prices undermine the convenience that the app claims to offer. It's disappointing to see a service that's supposed to make dining easier actually making it more expensive. I hope Swiggy addresses this issue and becomes more transparent with their pricing."
I had a very bad experience two days ago i ordered from swiggy fried rice after sometime the delivery boy gave me many miss calls from my number i was calling back but it was showing number doesnt exist i was in a meeting to understand what is happening so i called my sister who had to recieve the order to call the delivery boy and recieve but the delivery boy told her i cannot deliver to u i want to deliver only to that person who had made the ordered means registered number and cancelled the order witg the penality of the money which i had already paid.... then i called customer care n they said they cannot do anything even i told them i dont want money i want order... isnt it scammed... its not about money its about trust.. they never came outside my home.. delivery boy eat up my order and have written waiting time at your doorstep when my sister was requesting him to come.
Drunken and drugs using delivery boys for delivery.  Even they fight with other shop owners and try to hit.video will record and send you later.
Worst experience.Taking money only and not giving services and when we ask for refund they people is not even replying.
"Very Poor, Zero service, This is the third time that i am suffering, They gave my order to someone else. The delivery person was Rajan Khushwaha, he did not even bothered to pick any call of mine, neither help desk could track him, Anoop kumar Maurya did not help, neither any higher authority talked, They only wasted my time and did not even had courtesy to send the order again. SWIGGY IS A BIG SCAM. BIG SCAMMERS ARE RUNNING SWIGGY. VERY POOR TONE OF TALKING, THEY NEVER HELP, NEVER."
"Swiggy Mein short size container de raha hai  Payment full le raha hai, lekin Sab size ka container short size a raha hai khana"
"Swigy instamart delivers expiry product specially curd, milk and breads , this I have seen only in india and food minister is not bothered about human health, plus they don't have policy to refund for the near to expiry product and they even don't send executive to take back the product , big basket better in this aspect ....swiggy instama"
"Readily good dilevery services and happy to take order , taste quite preety good overall okay.Its good"
"I ordered masala dosa now, when I got the order, there was no sambar. I text and called the swiggy and told them that sambar missing then the swiggy people told me that swiggy not responsible for this.  I will never order from here or recommend it to anyone.  My experience at swiggy is not worth the cost.  I recommended to everyone always places order from Zomato Only…Zomato..zomato…zomato only"
Swiggy is a worst company they have bad rules you just place order after that there is no help and no support. As I ordered food and it was cancelled by kid mistakenly team has not supported and not even refunded a penny . No customer care service was provided.very pathetic very rediculous
BEWARE: We booked a table for Lunch for 12 persons through Swiggy Dine-out which offered 25 percent discount. The discount was denied by the restaurant saying that it was only applicable for ala carte and ala carte was not available for Lunch! Why did you book the table for Lunch then? Since we had already invited guests we had no option left but to pay full amount. So beware both Swiggy and Angeethi will lure you with this fraud and then deny the discount later. Of course if you argue they will say there is some fine print somewhere in T&C which will not be visible.
I'm regular costumer in swiggy and I got offer cool chilled 2 Coca-Cola for ordering above 200rs and I ordered some instruments and delivery boy bring warm drinks and I asked to swiggy team to replace cool drinks warm to cool And they apologized me and replaced my order And 2 time delivery boy bring same warm drinks ! Customer help line not replayed properly I have video with proof how we responsible # store maintenance and swiggy costumer help..# I'll upload this video in s media and Google feedback.

"Beiman log, logo ka pesa leker order nhi dete hai khud hi cancel karke refund bhi baps nhi karte hai ese hi apna account bhar rahe hai ......"
We don't like swiggy it's taking too lasy as worst delivery boys no experience from delivery when ordering snackes vest of time never never no need next time onwards from swiggy we lost money 300/-rs so guys never order from swiggy always vast worst food taking much of time lossing the food im taking action from next time never take order of swiggy always getting delaying time is vasted so keep its guys never take orders from now onwards very very very bad experience. Al delivery boys are worst and I need take action of this company I don't need take ratings highly zero of the experience those company so as soon as possible get very lest thinks and they don't no how to make food so swiggy is one of the lest days
"I ordered my food at 3:00 now tmy is 4:40 , till now I didn't get any update, and also I ordered beside restaurant it may take 20 min to come , at last I got updated that you ordered has been taken by someone, what he'll be happing in swiggy how careless they are chi .."
"They have removed customer connect through calls, only available on chat. No one bothers to respond to that chat. Connect to customer care through voice is only via the active order and they will not take any complaints. I have recently faced an issue with polar bear and they don’t take complaint, but days your order is complain number. When I ask them to drop an email or message to my mobile, they are not ready. I have received partial order and no one did anything to me. I have raised a complaint via the only chat, but nothing happened. Now a days it is worst. I request Swiggy to closely watch out else you would close soon. Good luck."
I am a student who comes to swiggy for giving surprises to my friends and family. I ordered for my sister who resides in kanpur but owing to surprise I did not asked her availability. I ordered cake on her birthday and cancelled it after her call. Swiggy deducted my entire amount whereas cake was not prepared and these are ruthless people not ready to change order date or location.please don't use this platform
Wrong location picking and then cancelling with 100% charges  Every time I have ordered  Very bad experience  Bad behaviour with thanks
Dont opt for swiggy. You will be disappointed.always delays the deliveries for food. Customer suport is slow
"Just today I went to a restaurant called new shanthi sagar very close to my house, we had one plate of idly vada and 2 plates of poor, the bill was ₹185=00, I tried ordering the same food / same restaurant on swiggy, the bill to be paid came to ₹315=00, this is absolutely day light robbery, on top of it they wanted to know if I wanted to add a tip to the delivery boy, people are being taken for a ride, not only do they hack up the prices, they add some non existent taxes on it plus the delivery charges, high time people boycotted these food delivery apps."
I had ordered food from swiggy app. Their app automatically attached an unknown address with my real location. I called the man who picked up my order. and told him the story and send a live location. He first denies to deliver my order on my real location. Then the company management called me and argued with me. And then they cancelled the order from their side and did not refund my money.  Swiggy is a fraud company. Please don't order food from them
I ordered items worth 300 rupes they sent me a packet of lays. When I raised issue they made me wait for a day then informed me that they have flagged the issue to store this is best they can do ..its not first time I faced issue it happened many times. Swiggy people are not eligible to stay in this industry.
"Hello, I use swiggy app and it's discounts and on time delivery so, I am happy to order food by swiggy."
"This happened. A delivery boy took money saying his vehicle broke down and he will immediately phone pay. Then he said his phone pay isn't working and he'll pay in the morning. We are calling their customer care since then, but to no avail. We know we have been duped, but we want to make sure, to tell this to whoever we can that their delivery boys are not trustworthy, since the customer care couldn't even contact him to resolve our issue. Most of them are theives in disguise."
I ordered pizza and cold coffee from izletes pizza through Swigy. They cancelled my order but order informing not provided to me. I wait for 1 and 1/2 hrs but not reach the food on my doorstep. Even mu money not refunded still. I tried to call swigy customer care but not getting response from them and izletes pizza shop. Bad experience for me. Please don't order pizza from here.
"I recently ordered from Swiggy and was largely impressed with the service. The app is user-friendly, making it easy to browse through a wide variety of restaurants and dishes. The ordering process was seamless, and I appreciated the real-time tracking feature that allowed me to see the status of my order at every stage.  The delivery was prompt, arriving well within the estimated time frame. The food was well-packaged and still hot upon arrival, which speaks to the care taken in handling and transportation. The delivery executive was courteous and followed the safety protocols diligently, which was reassuring.  However, I did encounter a minor issue with the availability of certain items. A couple of times, I found that items marked as available on the app were actually out of stock, leading to some last-minute changes in my order. Additionally, while the variety is great, I would love to see more options in the healthy and dietary-specific categories.  Overall, my experience with Swiggy was very positive, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient and reliable food delivery service. With a few tweaks to inventory management and expanded menu options, it could easily become my go-to choice for food delivery."
When I ordered vegetables from Instamart they show very good organic food pics n what you get is all dried up n stale vegetables. N further more when you order stuff u only receive half your items n then we have to call them again n again that we've not received our full order plus what ever free items also they give u don't receive it. As u r haggling with them for your orders u tend to forget about the freebie they have given.
Very shrewdly swiggy and it's partner chhappan bhog  Has delivered a totally ort and scattered garbage type biryani.After uploading the food status they have nothing to state and they refused to receive the call.
Items missing in order. It took me over an hour for the customer support team to understand the issue and all they had to submit was apologies and I can resolve the issue but the incident needs investigation.  The executive called the store manager and confirmed that there are missing items but insisted on me calling the next day.  I spoke with his senior who to
"My son order food for us. It was 3 meals + add on items, but we got only 1 meal + add on. When raised a complaint with Swiggy, they are ready to refund 50%, as hotel is claiming giving full quantity to delivery boy. Is it our fault. Also, the packet was not tampered. It contained only 1 meal. The cover cannot accomodate 3 meals. In this case, there is possibility that the hotel has given 2 or more covers and delivery boy has given only one. This should be verified by Swiggy. What so ever, we must get the full refund.  This kind of issues are increasing with Swiggy. If it is not considered by Swiggy, we will be forced to approach consumer court with all video and photographs of delivery with us."
"Had the worst experience today with swiggy delivery.  Placed an order at 7:30 pm, est delivery was 8:15. Waited till 9 pm. Contacted customer care, swiggy delivery partner, all sorts of reasons were given and yet the food was not delivered. Finally cancelled the order at 9 and ordered from a nearby restaurant hoping the food would finally come in 25 mins. Waited for another hour, the food was not delivered. Called the restaurant who said food was dispatched.. called the driver, he said he'll be home in 5 mins. Waited till 10 pm. Still no sign of the food. Customer service was not helpful. Just kept saying 5-10 mins. Called the driver again who said there was an issue with his bike. Seriously !! Had to cancel the order again at 10 pm after waiting for 2:30 hrs. Ridiculous!  I seriously don't understand what the issue was."
"I took the membership today and placed order. I was charged for delivery. I contacted customer care and by the time she tried to resolve query, food was delivered. I had to pay cash. After this I tried to contact them again, after multiple explanations delivery poor boy was blamed. God only help us. When it came to social media, tanothwr guy Austin connected and said not they can give refund... Funny... Isn't it. Attaching the fun.... I'm not able to upload recorded conversation."
"I placed an order and was informed that some items were unavailable. I was asked to modify the list by deleting the unavailable items and was redirected to the payment gateway again. I called the restaurant, and they informed me that the items are actually available and asked me to cancel the second order. I immediately contacted swiggy customer service and tried canceling the second order, but the amount was not refunded."
"Swiggy is best food dilevar. Any time costmar quick sportdelivery times, and a wide variety of restaurant options. Users often appreciate its reliable service and efficient order tracking system. However, like any platform, experiences can vary depending on location and individual orders."
"Swiggy staff don't respond to delivery partners about duty and incentive issues. They don't add incentives even if we reached target they required. They are used to ask us through online app to book late night shifts to gain incentives and bonus for late night shifts. But even if we did orders and reached target, they don't pay incentives and bonus. If we ask about this issues, they don't give proper solution. I request you all not to join this company as delivery partners. If you join as delivery partner, you will lose money and time."
"I had a very bad experience with Swiggy today. Customer care is pathetic. I have ordered my food from Wow China in HSR Layout by 12.55PM. Got a call from Swiggy Customer care by 2.30 PM and CC executive said that your food got a Spillage issue and can't be consumed and said that they can replace with a new order and delivery time will be by 4.30 PM.  When I raised the issue that will someone wait for another 2 hours for lunch, they have disconnected the call and initiated the refund.  Attitude of the CC executive was pathetic. They are not able to listen the voice of customer. Sad part is order got cancelled and refund been initiated and our lunch gone for a toss.  Pathetic experience with Swiggy Customer care. Better we can go with other delivery Apps. Atleast they listen to us and they show some courtesy for the customer.  Note. Worst Services to customer. There is no Customer care numbers. Whatever they have mentioned in the General Issue dashboard it's all supports them not the consumer."
"I cancelled my cod order, they told me to pay the 100%cancellations fee. I told them i have cancelled within 5 minutes, the restaurant wouldn't even have started the preparation. Also i have ordered different food at the same time from a different restaurant. After wasting my time with their customer support who was only given one pitch all they told me that its their policy if someone cancelled their order within “60 seconds” then only they can not put a cancellation charge otherwise its 100% cancellations charges on the next order. I asked can you yourself cancel order within 60 seconds. Leave cancellation can you think of cancellation. I have been ordering from swiggy since it was launched in the market and not once i faced this shitty experience. After twice calling them after arguing with them they connected me with the manager. He told me he will give me coupons for the cancellation fee then if i apply i will be payable if the cancellation charge. I used the coupon and saw that it was working.. but that day i didnt see that it adds the cancellation fee to the total amount and reduces the actual ordered foods charges and i still would be paying the same cancellation charge.  Anyway.. i will not be using swiggy henceforth because who has the time. We use swiggy to reduce our work of actually going the restaurants and eating sitting at home the same food. But yes.. I learned a lesson.. i would have lost more it not for just 500rs.  Please be aware.. the service is anyway shitty might as well use another platforms or the restaurants for home delivery."
Super poor service.Deliver agent not attending calls.Restaurant not at he’s calls and customer cares saying sry with a coupon of 50 Rs.Generally avoid Swiggy go for other aaps.
"I ordered food for 314 rupees , they said 25 to 30 mins, after 30 mins I called to delivery guy, he said still it is getting ready and it will take time. So I cancelled order. For that they charged 314 rupees full amount. I called to customer care. They are telling that is my cancellation so it is charged. Delaying is company side problem, they delayed, so I cancelled. But they are telling that is my problem. But how? Worst service, so I deleted swiggy from my mobile, life time I do not use this app , at the same time I ll tell to my friends, relatives and family numbers not use this and I ll tell I do not eat the food from swiggy delivery boy life time."
"""Ordered a birthday cake from Swiggy and was impressed with the awesome service! The cake arrived promptly and was delicious. Highly recommend! """
When I have not received one of the item which I have paid it's your duty and responsibility to deliver the item. How can you say that you will not refund or replace the order? Is this the way you service or treat valuable customers??  Share me your next level escalation details. I'll not leave you like this.
"Pathetic service given by Swiggy, its been 2 hours now acting for order and still not delivered neither getting any response on customer service by calling them, all is fake, seems I made a mistake by paying them in advance.."
"Poor delivery , late delivery , no delivery partners available even after 1hour . , Cancel orders for not being able to deliver on time , bad quality foos neither replaced nor compensat"
"Poor delivery , late delivery , no delivery partners available even after 1hour 30 min. , Cancel orders for not being able to deliver on time , bad quality foos neither replaced nor compensat"
I ordered some other cake and they delivered some other cake and now they are saying I can't do anything flavor and the total cake is different. They even didn't allow me to talk to agent. Simply close the chat. Worst app they didn't value customer. I also attached photo of what I ordered vs what I got.
"The worst experience, this is not for the first time...food was ordered at 8.22pm and was delivered at 10.00pm...what nonsense is this."
"Pathetic service, customer executive said fk off and disconnected call. Need that person fired. Received call today at 8:20pm for not assigning rider for good 1:30hrs , on top staff on customer care mishaved and abused"
The worst company in the world. No customer focus. You will not get food even after 2 hours. And they will cancel your order just like that saying some technical issues
"Swiggy is a very bad company, never trust them. They sent me a totally different order please use ZOMATO. Zomato is much better"
"Ordered food at 10.19pm waited for 53mins but still no delivery has been done , no contact no, no intimation abt delivery, restaurant person told me dat food has been picked up also waited 25mins after talking to him but no use at all finally my daughter slept without food coz no restaurant open at that time at our location very bad bad bad experience"
Booking kuch aur karo dete kuch aur hai sale kuxxx hai inse kabhi kuch bhi na magaye Mai aap sabhi janta se nivedan karta hau kuxxx hai sale sab...  Isse best Zomato hai  Swiggy land hai kuch order kabhi na kare  My order no.174150614249163
"Swiggy refund policy is worst . Yesterday swiggy team has cancelled my order due to some technical glitch and refund was raised for the same .. i was expecting the refund to be vredited back in 2 hours as per swiggy regund policy .. its been more than 24 hours , I am still waiting for my refund ."
"It seems that many customers have experienced issues with Swiggy's delivery, such as lack of manpower and no compensation for late delivery. Zomato, on the other hand, has a better track record when it comes to compensating customers for late delivery. Many customers have noted that Zomato is more reliable and prompt in delivering orders on time. Additionally, Zomato offers a variety of discounts and rewards to customers who use the app often or order large amounts of food. Therefore, it is understandable why customers prefer Zomato over Swiggy when it comes to delivery."
Every time i order from swiggy it takes wrong address and then the customer care people and the delivery guy blame me for entering wrong address even after explaining them the issue. I just hate this app and have uninstalled it for several times for this reason but after today’s same bad experience im not gonna install this useless app again.
Had order mutton curry from taste of India restaurant.. There was fly in that curry..had to raise a complaint and it was solved.. thy gave me coupon of 450rs instantly.. but dint inform o have to use it only one time..  Next day I ordered Dosa from the coupon but then to i had payed 60rs..  Now rest money which is 380 thy are not ready to refund it back..  Don't order from this Swiggy..thy are asking me to rate.. not worth for even 1 star
"Had ordered two havmor cone icecream, however I have received lotte brand cone icecream which was average in taste.  I have already complained about this to their support team along with the invoice. But, they are not accepting their mistake and claiming that it was the same one. This behaviour is very unacceptable and I need a clarification for this."
The swiggy is not good platform to serve better. Mu experience is not good they dont seen and identify the address just asking payment it this order COD also not available. When I trying to cancel my order they charged customer support team they are not good team.
"The rating is not even 1… but this software not allowing me for that The delivery partner’s service and attitude towards that service is very worst, his attitude mainly horribly worst. It’s high time they train their delivery partners for what is fair and proper service or they could shut down…."
Horrible delivery service . After making me wait for 2 hours for the delivery . When I voluntarily call the customer support . They then inform me that they will have to cancel my order . Swiggy is the worst
Dineout plus food delivery is far better than Zomato.  Earlier Zomato had better services but now after merging with Dineout swiggy has taken the lead.
Order never delivered. Bad aervice.  Waited 2 hours.  Finally cancelled.  I hope this app goes bust.
"I am a regular customer of swiggy my yesterday's order disappoint me because order is for someone else and it take more than 1hour and 30min , when order accepted thetime given tome it 35:36min after 20min of my order from swiggy I will order from zomato and they deliver me in 30 min, very bad and embarrassed experience this time with swiggy never suggest anyone they don't value ur time and food was also stinking like 2 days old totaly waste of money and time."
I'm experience of sweegy instamart is very bad customer service is bad and help center person talking way is inappropriate and I'm too disappointed this platform and I never suggest to go for sweggy instamart
The food that i ordered was delivered too late as they assign delivery boy to multiple orders. We can't blame on delivery boy. When I cancelled they charged full amount as cancellation charges. Telling that food is wasted. These kind of food delivery are getting double the amount to delivery on time. But swiggy is too worst among any other food delivery.
"Supplying wrong food and customer support worst. 7 times send wrong food, if I calls customer support not ready to clear the issue even if you sent mail repy is like the company dom"
Try to work on delviery service its now creating more problem in local areas and prices are now more higher showing in app which are lower on the stores.
I ordered food and waited for 45 minutes. the order cam at home. I paid rs 500 and the delivery boy did not have change so he canceled my order.
I paid money for the food the lazy delivery man camcelled it from his side and my amount that I had prepaid was not returned.  Chor company... I had ordered favorite food for the kids
Very bad my bill payment was showing 196 but when i asked a delivery guy he said 249 they don’t post proper bill payment then the customer must should return the parcel
I asked for a delivery and waited for quite a long time. Even a delivery executive was not assigned. No intmation was given regarding non-availability of executives. I just ended up waiting for a long time and then had to cancel the order. Shoddy service from the BOT too.
I had ordered Mishti Doi and what was delivered to me was food full of fungus. I shared pics with Swiggy. Instead of taking the vendor to task they have reverted with no help saying the vendor has adopted standard techniques of preparation. So guys be aware orders from Swiggy are at your own RISK
Had ordered 6 liters of mother dairy milk from swiggy instamart the milk supplied ws spoiled and curdeled. Also swiggy is not ready for refund or replacement.I strongly suggest blacklist swiggy.
"For the second time this week my food orser is delayed by more than 25 mins, thr eta while ordering was 60 mins ( zomato usually delivers within 45 mins) than after 15 mins when i checked the eta was increased to 71 mins , i waited for another 10 mins and the eta was still at 70 mins, the order which i had to get by 2:30 PM is now further delayed by 30 mins, seems the do not have any delivery partner nearby"
"On 25/03/24 i had done online order by swiggy and paid payment by smile, by mistake at the time of delivery i had give cash rs 595 to delivery boy"
"I had ordered a pizza and the delivery agent delivered the pizza in a school bag  The box I received was a cheesy mess with everything sticking to the top of the box.  Despite having produced numerous visual proof and testimonies swiggy simply hasn’t even responded to my efforts  Moreover the agent in chat are rude, lazy and indifferent .  Never ordering form swiggy again"
"Didn't get my order 2 french fries large, chicken zinger burger, unlimited chicken bucket, dips, Coke and etc I only received chicken popcorn and chicken strips I raised complain but no one responded and the delivery boy gave us order and run away we told him wait I will check my order but he run i called him but no response delivery boy name is Deepak jaiswal.I also call in branch but they also not picking my call My time waste for this bull shet I am not accepting this kind off behaviour this is very disgusting behaviour. And swiggy reply your money not refundable"
I had ordered from Swiggy instamart and they deducted my money and nothing arrived and I also mailed them and took screenshots but they didn’t reply me at all. Worse customer service.
"Listen I'm not here to support Zomato, but atleast they are fair and decent enough at service  In Swiggy always delay in delivery, no customer care support, they assign delivery partner in the last minute literally when ETA is 40 min they assign  someone in last 9 min, why the pressure on partners, there is no Customer care to answer, it's always Bot which respond, look the SS I have attached, they say delivery will be assigned at 11:46 and it will delivered at 11:47, in A minute ?? really Swiggy?"
"Beware friends from swiggy they invented new way to do scam, if they are failed to deliver a order on time then they ask assign delivery person to go to the customer location & close the order by fake delivery (without parcel)...  There support team instead of resolving the issue just keep saying that sir I can understand, delivery person not picking calls bla bla..."
Most restaurants have inflated prices sometimes even double on Swiggy and they decive by declaring some small discounts. Actual restaurant tarrifs are often 20-30% lesser than on Swiggy.  Scam to say the least
Worest service money waste to book in swiggy
"The worst service ever and most pathetic application. They will never provide any support in case of any issue with your food instead they just keep charging more and more money .Very poor service. Highly disappointed. They don’t take any responsibility after delivering wrong products. On complaining, they sent a lame message saying we can’t refund..waste of time and waste of money"
Negative remarks.  I have ordered continuously but never deliver fresh and hygienic food.  A common problem is they never deliver at time and most of time they denied to deliver.  I have faced this problem so many times.
"The worst service ever. I am a foreigner but they expect me to speak and guide their delivery agent to my house for delivery. When I can't, they cancel my order without refund. I called to complain and they coldly told me that's how things are. It's their policy. Cancelling without refund for an order worth over 1200 rupees for something I can't control is mid day robbery of the highest order. I am cancelling their service"
"Pathetic service, twice in a day. Order is always delivered late with no fresh and hot food. Why will you pay for this. Customer support is pathetic"
"The swiggy and insta mart delivery partners are worst in bandra west. They roaming on YULU bike with no extra cost and fail to deliver the items on time. Mostly they deliver food or other grocery after 45 minutes. The worst part is the call centre, that nonsense people not pick the phone on time, and if pick the phone and disconnect the call immediately when we ask the ontime delivery."
Hello I had ordered two items from bread cafe and neither of them arrived. i called the delivery guy and he said he can’t deliver to my location ( i always order from BC and get my item so i dont understand why he said that) and then he refused to deliver the item and it was cancelled. we reached out to an agent but they didn’t provide good respond. very disappointed
"Most pathetic application, they started looting people in a different way, they won't deliver our order but says that it's delivered and if we complaints no one will response to the complaint, and they won't even give us the refund.. disgusting service and waste application."
"I ordered from Swiggy and gave them my adress. While the order was getting prepared, I checked and found that the adress was different which I gave. I called them and said that the adress shown is wrong. They said they are cancelling my order and will not refund also. How why? this is clear case of Fraud."
"I had ordered a large cheese popcorn and large Nachos along with a Coke zero can to enjoy my Sunday afternoon. On the order delivery I received a small box of popcorn which has only salted popcorn and the Coke can was missing. On informing the same to the customer service, they were not able to resolvey complaint and I did not receive a proper compensation for the order failed at Swiggy's end. But my money and my time was wasted on this food provider company which they claim themselves to be food providers. I had to provide 1 star as it's the minimum requirement. I feel that they don't even deserve 1 star.  This is not the first time that I had experienced such things with Swiggy. It has happened before as well. First the charge you for swiggy one membership and then they give you -1 service.  I would recommend people to stop using this company."
"Urgent Refund Request for Order # mentioned above. Dear Swiggy Customer Service, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request an urgent refund for an order that was not delivered satisfactorily. I placed an order through Swiggy for momos from Social, totaling Rs. 532, on either [19th or 20th march or 21 march]. Unfortunately, the delivery was not successful, and despite repeated attempts to address this issue with your team, the problem persists. nobody calls us, nobody leaves the food in the postbox. The order number for this transaction is [1684605491381], and the contact number associated with my account is. I regret to inform you that this is not the first time I have encountered such a problem with deliveries. On numerous occasions, my orders have been left unattended in locations accessible to animals, leading to their consumption before I could retrieve them. This is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the quality of service provided. I kindly request an immediate refund for the amount charged for this order.  Failure to do so will force me to explore other avenues to seek redress, including leaving a negative review of my experience. Please expedite this matter, and I look forward to a prompt resolution. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely,  Since x account was recently blocked his friend y is handling this situation"
"Swiggy, one of the awesome facility for old age people and their near ones. The people who are not in position to go to market or restaurants due to their age factor they can avail this facility and can enjoy their old age also with their partners. Even their near ones who are not staying with them due to some or other factor can also order good food or any grocery or household items through swiggy instamart. this is not only helpful to old age people but also working woman, students who are staying far from their houses also. Thanks for this start up for giving all these facilities."
Very pathetic experience and I'm too much disappointed with delivery and all over service of swiggy. I have raised a complaint related to damaged items on 4th March 2024 i have yet to receive my refund amount. I tried many times to connect with costumer service but didn't response from their end.
I have order kid lotion from instamart as it was bit urgent but received expired product when I raised issue they are telling me to wait for 6 hrs. What is use of instamart if they are not providing instant resolution. Very poor service. Highly disappointed ??
"They don't take any responsibility after delivering wrong products. I ordered a veg burger yesterday and they delivered chicken burger... On complaining, they sent a lame message saying we can't refund.. You better rate the restaurant ... Is this the solution to the issue? How can a Vegetarian person expected to eat non veg food? Worst experience... Refund our money back"
Recently I purchased some items from Swiggy Instamart and they delivered spoiled items(milk) first I discussed the same with Sonia she behaved so politely then due to limited support availability she connected me to her senior Sameer Khan worst support person I have ever seen he is here in support to take feed back and share with team not to solve it. And he closed chat. Worst support I have ever seen. Now I have deleted this worst app.

"Frequent late delivery especially at night. Delivery estimate given as 30 mins but no delivery partner assigned even after 1.5 hours, in spite of speaking with customer service. Pathetic waste of time."
"My refund is, credited though it took time, but i got my refund thanx Team Swiggy. However some sales person were very irresponsible but overall they were good"
Third class experience refund nhi Diya ek baar nhi do baar bekaar foods sab faila hua bheja inhone uske baad sunte nhi hai ....Naveen gupta
Swiggy ko black list kar do month ma 2 order Kara ha dono order cancel kar deya ha but Jo payment ha vo 7 working days ma refund hoga jab ki mere koi be mistake ni ha jab be order Kara ha hotal off ho gya hota ha very bad service ??????????

The most horrible and pathetic application. They will never provide any support in case of any issue with your food instead they just keep charging more and more money as delivery fee.  Their delivery is also not up to the mark and always late. Always prefer Zomato over Swiggy. These people are horrific.
"I had ordered fried noodles from imperial hotel on Feb 27th, 2023.I paid delivery agent 229 rs online via upi.He claimed that he didn't receive the amount, though the amount clearly was debited from my account.I showed him too but he refused to accept that he had received the money and ask me to pay again.I told him , there might be an issue on his app but he refused to leave.I again had to pay him 229 rs via upi.He also claimed in case the amount comes swiggy will refund my money back.It has been 3 days, swiggy is not refunding my money at all.I had complained on 27th February, to customer care and they acknowledged and reassured that I will get the money.I didnt receive yet.So i again tried to connect to customer care.The customer care agent whose name was Ekdisha, was highly stupid and uncooperative.She told me that I cannot ask for resolving this issue as 24 hours had passed.She also asked me for screenshot of my voice talk.I argued to connect to Supervisor, who too asked me for details and later verified it.He assured I will receive the refund in a day.I haven't still received it.They are hiring goons who intimidate us to pay for an order already paid by spinning stories and their customer care is most unpleasant and unprofessional. They just dont want to work.I will demand from Swiggy management, that if a customer has an issue , then they must resolve it within 24 hours.If they cannot resolve it, then they cannot fix a deadline of 24 hours for us and blame the customer for raising the issue again.229 rs is hard earned money, and its my right to get my money back.Why should I pay the price for a criminal they hired, who is fooling and extracting money from innocent customers?Its such a big platform and they are reluctant to refund 229 rs!God knows, what would they do if the amount is higher."
"Very pathetic customer support, just email conversation that too very late reply from there side and no call to customer even after providing relevant proof. Seriously not expecting something in service industry.  Seems like they dont care at all once order is delivered in very bad/ rotten / smelly condition.  They don't even deserve 1 star."
I called swiggy and mail and I attach the screenshot videos and all but his not pass to my claim and I told my all item are received but ice cream is not receive ice cream cost is 300 rupees so I told swiggy customer executive and male also I want refund my money otherwise please arrange my ice cream package. But he say mam your claim is invalid I told you mam please check all the photos and videos I send the Google drive attach.  Aapane Jo niche option di hai uske andar mein Google drive ka link upload kar rahi hu par vo video ka link upload nahin Ho pa raha to me apko yaha pe vo link bhejti hu.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YfdUtfPRrDd5oP-C6b8WTo24z3zdPB1b/view?usp=driv esdk  Ye lik he video ka ap Chalke kar sakte ho good draiv me
Delivered pizza in inedible condition. Pieces were flipped with messy toppings. The box was wet.  Worst food delivery process. Delivery person knew something went wrong but still delivered n left.
I orderd food for my mom and the not delivered food and marked their site deliverd. After i contacted custmer care through email i got replay food from swiggy its deliverd the cant refund my money i lost my money and time. always double think when ordering food from swiggy
"Friends, , not sure whether you guys are aware of this or not. Swiggy(now Zomato as well) has now been showing around 25% excess price on their app which is over & above the MRP of the restaurant's prices, , which is too much. Apart from that, platform fee, delivery fee, taxes, packaging charges, service fee, etc. All this comes to 30-35% hike on the restaurant's menu price. We should think that this much% of service charges is valid or not. Also, we should start giving opportunities to other new players as well to cut down such monopolies. As we are not giving opportunities to new players, so, they are not able to tie up with the restaurants because of these monopolies."
I have ordered food from kwality walls and swiggy called saying out of stock i asked executive to send other ice cream flavour which is available he was not listening to me inspite he rushed to close the order and refund. I said him if you cut the call i will escalate this but he was least bothered like do what ever you want to do. Then I wrote email to escalate further on this but there was no response on it they were not even reading the email and send irrelevant response which are pre populated text i replied several times but same common responses then i understood they are least bothered of customer complaints and issues I will not take swiggy membership. Very bad customer service swiggy.

"I had a very bad experience regarding my order on 03/02/2024. By mistake, the order has been booked on some other address. Although, I cancelled the order within 30 mins but neither I have received the order, nor I got any kind of refund. Kindly help me with the same.  Pramod Kumar  8800685802"
"I ordered 4 lava cakes from Hira sweets through swiggy on 14 Feb 2024. They assigned delivery boy Talib for this. I keep on waiting for my order for 50 minutes but I didn't receive my order. When I check the swiggy app, it was showing that my order was delivered. I complaint about this to their customer care through mail and asked for my refund. But they refused to refund my money saying that my order was delivered without any investigation. It seems their delivery boy and their customer support both are partners in this scam. They are robbers"
"Mr Sankar Narayan delivered my swiggy order and took inr400 . He came back in 5min and indicated my online payment and returned my m9ney. We should honour his honesty and a tip is not sufficient. Lplet swiggy recognize his goodbehavior , character and respect him in a ompany get together. Keep it up Sankar. Cheer up. Chin up - gopalakrishnan, tampxxxxxx@gmail.com"

Most of the time they cancel orders after receiving it showing false reason of inaccurate address. And they don't return the fund. Never pay them until and unless you receive the order.

"Encountering a distressing ordeal with a recent Swiggy Genie order no- 165915986391365 and seeking urgent intervention. Placed an order on Feb 3rd for a courier pick-up at 1:15 pm from Model Town, destined for Saket. Despite the delivery executive confirming receipt and the Swiggy app displaying their purported location, it was later claimed that the destination by the delivery executive was not reached. CCTV footage unequivocally shows the pick-up. This alarming discrepancy suggests potential exploitation of the platform or a glaring lack of accountability. Have diligently pursued resolution through customer support with all evidence provided but there is no revert with a resonable solution. Sharing to highlight the gravity of the situation and demand immediate action. it seems the portal is used by theifs to use personal information of the customers and steal their expensive things sent through couriers, while the customers rely on accountability to such a big platform of a company.  #CustomerService #SwiggyGenie #DeliveryNightmare  Swiggy SWIGGY DELIVERY BOYS DELHI Swiggy Genie"

"I was cheated twice by Instamart delivery of Swiggy    In Dec 2023, some fresh products received were bad. On asking for a refund they refused.    On 01.02.2024, they supplied around 1 kg watermelon and charged me Rs. 112. The website states the weight of watermelon as 1.5 to 3 kg weight and cost Rs.112.      On bringing this to the notice of Swiggy they refused to accept return of small watermelon and give me the refund for same.  They are out there to cheat customers as they demand payment prior delivery.  Beware when dealing with them."
"I ordered food from Empire via Swiggy  After an hour the representative calls me and tells my order is taken by some other platform and he will cancel my order  After sometime I get message I am to pay 400+ because order was cancelled under 1 minute  This is pathetic, worst customer service  Every time I order something one or the other item will be missing  Very bad customer support"
Swiggy is totally bakwaas fraud and cheat. They deliver very late and most of the time the food is cold and soggy. Sometimes its spilled and already eaten. Swiggy instamart is worst. One or other item is missing. No proper custimer support. They ask you to write an email and wait for 6 to 8 hours. They mever refund or provide a replacement wveb if it is their fault. They r cheats and scamsters.Food has hair or is stale and burnt.They never take responsibility for their behavior or bad service.
Ordered food for my daughter. Money debited and Order also taken. Waited for 45min no sign of the food. When called they were saying they don't see the order ...it was frustrating.. ..Then swiggy o ly told they are replacing the order. Now again I waited for 40min and no info on order and I see the delivery time is keep on increasing.it was showing 40min after waiting for 40min. Then called again the same story and they cancelled my order. I want to give 0 rating but not able to. it happened to me multiple times. Once they said it was delivered and i didn't get the food and they don't know what happened..Please don't go with Swiggy...May be Zomato or any other app is better.

Zero star 00000 Delivery is not on time. There is no manner of speaking which is not the way to speak to the delivery boy. Speaks rudely .They charge cancellation charges. This cancellation charge is levied for the amount of food ordered.
I order cheesy comfort from Pizza Hut 2 time and both the time the order was not prepared perfect. There was no cheese and tasteless with bad presentation.i contacted swiggy for refund or new product.

I order zero sugar coke from Swiggy. If they dont have it they modify the initial order to reflect the regular coke they have in stock. They deliver what they have and if you object they will not refund or replace. I usually order 24 cans and they deliver 1-3 cans less on multiple occasions

I have ordered Pedigree in swiggy but opened that packet after 4 days of order received. I can see warms in Pedigree and also manufacture date of Pedigree is 22/08/23 and expiry is 16/08/24. I contacted customer support but they are not ready to give the refund. They stated We would like to inform you that refunds or replacements for queries raised after 96 hours from the order delivered cannot be issued.  This is not done. Please don't buy anything from swiggy Instamart. The cost of Pedigree is Rupees 1116

Today I ordered Duo chicken popcorn chicken ricebowlz but something else was delivered. On contacting swiggy the response was totally unsatisfactory .. they refused to pick up the wrong item and deliver the correct order. They make the mistake and we pay the price.

"To my dismay, an unauthorized deduction of Rs140 (for idli vada) and 55 delivery charges..(which was never delivered)from my bill , which has raised serious concerns about the transparency and reliability of Swiggy's billing process. I understand that errors can occur, but it is disheartening to feel like I am being taken advantage of as a customer.  1) What made you think that without providing the services you can deduct my money !! Answer me??  2) What made you think that being a service provider, without providing the service for which you are paid for, you can go away like this?? Answer that!!  3) what made you think that you are not bounded by law?? Answer me!!!  4) what made you think that such a big scam( looting 100s of customer every day) is never going to burst up someday?? Answer me!!!!

I have ordered some groceries today. Cost was Rs. 385. I had done so many oders for the same location but today something happened different. I got a call from delivery boy that location is incorrect and he is saying to cancel the order asap. I denied and have requested on chat that this is happening. Then again i got a call from a different swiggy person and said will deduct all amount as location is incorrect then i said that ll reach at the location and will take our order then he put our call again on hold for 10m n holded 2times for same time period. And that he said a different agent has already cancelled our order and they will not refund a single amount.  Earlier swiggy was helping people but now swiggy has hired some fraud people and making money.  The point is there app is not proper. Before confirming the payment or receiving the order they are not even have updated about 100% cancellation. Good luck swiggy but i will never recommend anyone to order anything from swiggy. Its fraud company
I order the food and I already told them my phone battery died so call another number but they don’t  And they canceled my order and take my money also.
"I have been cheated by Swiggy delivery platform twice, first i placed order in KFC mogappair west for Rs. 1789 it has been cancelled by restaurant and no refund received till now, this happened on 13th Dec 2023, now again i placed order in AB's absolute BBQ for Rs 2043 , this again has been cancelled by swiggy saying technical fault and raised refund. Both payment i made through net banking.. public please be aware of Swiggy refunds. They have started scamming customer's. Worst service"
"They give some bio degradable plastics to deliver items and advertise we care nature and all the fancy words. If you open the bag, inside all their organic vegetables are packed individually with toxic materials. They use cheap quality nylon pouches. Once you take out you will see nylon powders everywhere. There is high chance of these powders getting into food which is dangerous for health. I have complained many times they they don’t take it seriously because they think customers are fools. I would prefer buying vegetables from local shops instead."
"I ordered Dhokla from haldiram through Swiggy on 31st of December 2023 in morning around 8.30am and time of delivery was 44 minutes.

I lodged a complaint and they refused to refund the amount stating that cancellation should be within one minute. But here because of seeing delay , I cancelled the order. Had I waited for late arrival , I would have got"

I'd suggest everyone...they even don't call after reading texts and all.
"I recently encountered a severe security breach on SWIGGY platform, leading to unauthorized transactions and a subsequent outstanding payment on Lazypay. Despite clarifying the fraudulent nature of these orders and ongoing cybercrime investigation, Swiggy and Lazypay have not taken appropriate responsibility.  case details: happened on 22nd Dec’2023 at about 8pm, I was flooded with more than 1000 SMS and finally some fake ord was placed by using swiggy elsewhere in Gurgaon whereas I am based out of pune.  Swiggy's apparent lack of security allowed someone to log into my account remotely and place unauthorized orders. This incident has raised serious concerns about the platform's security protocols.  I urge Swiggy to reassess and fortify its security measures to prevent such fraudulent activities. As a customer, I expected a more proactive and responsible approach from a widely used service like Swiggy.  Unfortunately, this experience has left me deeply dissatisfied and skeptical about the security of using Swiggy for future transactions. I hope Swiggy takes these concerns seriously and implements necessary improvements to ensure a secure and trustworthy platform for all users.  Thanks for reading this  Sandeep Rai"
My opinion is for what they doing with delivery boys  1 swiggy application take very high bettery conguption( bettery bhout kheta hai)  2 when you few minutes wait after pickup the order app ring start moving order is delay. But Zomato never say  Good thing is this  . Best customer service  In a half hour delivery the order

I checked the Sujatha mastani but Swiggy as usual is charging more. From 120 to straight 156+ delivery charges.. I will just request everyone to stop using this app. They are charging too much. Actually they are cheating clients. I am going to post on social media.

Since the delivery agent not moving in Swiggy map, I thought to check through call and got to know about the accident. When I checked with customer care informing same, seems agent met with accident. They are like Ok, What help you need. Not bothered about agents at all."
"I ordered and the delivery partner enters the society but doesn't deliver and runs away not answering calls of swiggy or mine.  Arun and Rahul rana kept wasting the time and didn't help at all, and in the end tried to offer me 50 rs in compensation, even that isn't received. These guys keep repeating the word sorry without even meaning it like a bot.  Extremely upset with instamart agents behaviour.. Rahul rana and Arun."
Offers RS 318 for playing with customers life. Why you guys do fake advertising if you can not deliver on time? Driver said he was far away and you guys forced him to deliver

"???? Beware of False Promises! ????  I had a terrible experience with the Swiggy app today and I feel cheated! ???? I ordered food from their app, lured by the promise of a 30-minute delivery time. I was starving and couldn't resist the temptation. Little did I know what awaited me! ??  After anxiously waiting for what felt like an eternity, my food finally arrived. after a whopping 1 hour and 45 minutes! ???? Not only was the delivery late, but to add insult to injury, the food was stone-cold! ????  This kind of behavior by Swiggy is unacceptable! It's a clear case of false advertising and misleading their customers. ??????? How can they claim a 30-minute delivery time and fail so miserably, leaving their customers hungry and disappointed? It's a breach of trust and a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. ??  I believe in holding companies accountable for their actions, and I urge all of you to think twice before ordering from the Swiggy app. Let's spread the word and make sure others don't fall victim to this unethical practice! ????

"Hello,  I want to describe the worst experience with Swiggy where I have ordered food at 1.20 pm and waited till 2.40 pm for food to gey delivered. Initially the delivery time showed 35-40 mins, but after waiting for 1.5 hours I sought help from customer support they said that they are also not able to connect to the delivery partner and asked me to call.  I also called the delivery partner few times but it got unanswered, hence I asked the customer support to cancel my order and refund me.  They said that they have cancelled the order and the refund will be credited to the source account within 2 hours.  When the refund was not credited after 4 hours, I again complained to the customer support they said that because the order was cancelled they cannot refund my money.  I mailed also to the swiggy support but again got the same answer.  From last 5-6 years I am using Swiggy and I never faced such issue and I was surprised that after raising the complaint several times Swiggy didn't help me when the fault was from their side.  First they make me wait so much for the food to get delivered during lunch time and after promising for the refund they refused to refund my money"
Bought toor dal for rs.150/-(500g) of tata brand which is available for rs.90/- in amazon.even the product received is damaged n had quality issues I have asked to take back the product but refused by swiggy team.  so please be careful
"I had ordered to McD through Swiggy. I recieved my order 20 mins late with 3 missing items: Veg Pizza McPuff, Large fries and McVeggie Burger. This burger was a complementary one which wasn't received as well. The sum total of the order was Rs. 663.81 and I was made to pay Rs. 702. When I complained about this their staff replied me: 'I am sorry for the inconvenience caused but we cannot help you further as it not in our policies'  This inconvenience is not expected by Swiggy but which was caused at every stage throughout my order. This was definitely not tolerable and DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED. The delivery boy was: Nirupama Sahoo (080 6926 XXXX)"
I ordered an item and it was out of stock.  They didn't return my money yet.  Food will be worst @ night times.

I paid 188rs for the chicken wings. I want the refund of that amount.Refund my amount . The delivery person Rabikant Prasad and Help executive Irshad assured me that my amount 188rs will be refunded to me. But it's not done so . Why should I pay for the food not delivered to me .  Please enquire with the delivery partner, he is a fraud. He didn't come with my order, took the amount from me and said to me that chicken wings amount will be refunded. Why should I pay for the order not delivered to me."
We have ordered and cancelled in 1 min but it's showed 2 mins in there system.  They are taken cancellation fee is 100%. Without give food they took 100% money if we ask the support team they are saying it's T&C.  Even if its cancelled it's 100% they take it very very worrest.  Please don't don't us swiggy friends
No food deliver . I have been charged of delivery food where I collect my food . Despite escalate to customer support but they did not do anything . Customer support does not help

Wish there was a negative rating. Never order fruits or vegetables on swiggy instamart. Rotten ones will be delivered. Writing this after 10 orders. Each time some spoiled item is delivered. I kept using it expecting good ones will be delivered each time and also to save time of going to store and purchasing. Swiggy has made me realise I should never order from it. Will never recommend to anyone
"A couple of day ago I ordered pastry and jar cake from Sweet Truth via Swiggy. The pastry was completely melted and became somewhat liquid by the time it could reach me. The cake jars looked like they had fungus on them.  All in all, completely inedible, disgusting food delivered by these people! When I reached out to swiggy support, they gave the standard reply that they have been giving lately for any problems. Check images attached.  Later when sent them an email, they gave me a 29 rs discount voucher for an order of 400 bucks. ??  Swiggy’s standards have declined massively with extremely unsupportive support team! Since then, I have stopped using the app!"
I am Neha from gurgaon I used swiggy for a cake order and in error and they charged me fee of full amount for cancelling the order. I tried to check for help from their customer service and they just said that as per their policy I will have to accept that Rs 480.00 was a cancellation fees. It's funny that they did this but also it's really service from one of the top online delivery platform. I will never use it again Do Not Use
"I opened Swiggy app and it mentioned free Lays worth 50 if I ordered for more than 199. I ordered for more than 199 but Lays did not come. On chatting with customer support of Swiggy, they mentioned since it was a freebie, we can't do anything about it.  I felt cheated. This is how companies like Swiggy lure you into buying things and then don't stick to their promise."
"Food item went missing at the time of delivery. Rider said he is not responsible. Make complain at customer care.  They said coupon of Rs.21- will be given irrespective of the fact that item was valued at much higher price. If not satisfied then email your concern.  We emailed. Only to get reply ""To rate the restaurant as minimum"". There is no fault of swiggy.  Neither they take responsibility of the pick items nor the delivery or delivery man. It seems there is no mechanism to see what items were ordered and how many items a rider has to pick up.  Simply irresponsible and careless"
Swiggy delivery is a great service. One request to keep it eco friendly- pls stop sending fruits and vegetables in the netted bag. Hope you apply this feedback..
I make an order and waiting for it near by 45 min but after that agent called me and giving me excuse that ur order misplaced to some body else its a joke I m paying online and waiting for

Don't order from Dominos. I have ordered 3 pizzas through Swiggy from Dominos and it is almost 3:00 hours. I am yet to get my pizzas.

"""I ordered Dal Makhani from Swiggy recently, while the delivery was on time, the packaging could have been a bit better. Instead of packing in a container, they had packed it in an aluminium foil and tied quite loosely with rubber bands."""
I placed an grocery order and they cancelled it saying that delivery guy was unable to reach me... though I didn't receive any call from the delivery guy. I kept receiving messages saying that delivery person is unable to reach you but there was no no.

They said Rs. 318 will get charged from my account.  Delivery boy was very nice man..he was scared without his fault..but the person name Youvraj on call was not at all helpful rather he was rude and on chat I was with Monu she too was not useful.. Please resolve it..i will pay only Rs. 254.."

Today we ordered peanut butter and swiggy delivered expired product. If we wouldn't have checked date we could have consumed it. They play with public health. Expired product shouldn't be stored in shops.
Matrial quest example 100 quest and delivery 140 rupees product quality 10/3  ??????????
Last week i ordered from bk and when the delivery guy delivered it he held my hand and was asking for a tip. I said my mom won't let me but he still forced me to. So i gave him ₹20 but still he forced me to give him so more so when i gave ₹10 more then he left me
"Worst service in delivery partner in swiggy, not good service i had face 5/6 times in my order.  Please improve this sillu issues."
"I had ordered some items from restaurant but after receiving my order I found that actual bill of restaurant is less than actual payment done by me. The same issue I had observed and reported to Swiggy earlier also. When I reported the issue the reply from Swiggy was that as per Swiggy bill this amount is OK whereas I am also Swiggy one member, and as per memberships benefits all deliveries are free. Also there customer care person was also not responding properly"
Swiggy imstamart ka order Castomer tak time pe pohonch cha na mushkil hai ready pehle mark mil jata hai order nahi milta bohot kharab hai ??
"I have spent more than more than lakhs of Rupees in ordering food from Swiggy and the service is getting worst and worst day by day, Multiple times I have faced delay in order, delivery partner not reachable, delivery partner not coming and even today also the delivery partner went away with my order as per the customer care and his phone is off since an hour? Do you think Refund is the only way to get your customer back everytime, no , thier time , money all is being invested, it's happening regularly and have decided to go with Zomato and other food delivery platforms."
"4th time, it was in 2 months, that swiggy could not deliver. Very poor service nowadays. It is coming down very fast, do not ever order prepaid. They will give you some vouchers and next time, again, it will be problem, real harassment."
"Found Instamart CnF in Vashi koparkhairane area supplies goods without phy.verification .never maintain cool chain whether it is a order of meat , frozen food , milk, fresh flowers...Every time time storage and delivery condition is pathetic."
"Ordered dinner for my parents, waited for 1 hour and then Swiggy cancelled it without any update and deducted all our money. worst experience. ridiculous service. When I asked them to take delivery guy into conference they don't even have contact details of their delivery guys."
Very bad expeiance by 1st order. Neither order recd nor refund recd. Never order from such fraud Co. They are totally harrsessing cusomers.
Delay of order by swiggy. Cancellation on confirmation of refund by their executive. No money refunded no order delivered. Grievances chatting is useless waste of time.  Theft and fraudster.
"Worst experience with the swiggy app. They make us wait for hours even for the radius of within 1km and won't even notify. Their delivery time has some different standards, It doesn't move at all. Never trust on this app. This is not the first time getting to see this treatment."
"Have been a regular customer at Swiggy instamart. Sharing my latest 2 experiences.  1st- A jar of chutney was shattered I to pieces by the delivery guy ( I am not upset with him. It was an accident and can happen with anyone) I asked the customer care guys to take back the order and send me a fresh one as all the other items had messed up. Everything else was smelling of chutney and had oil all over them, even inside the groundnut packet that I ordered. The cc guys said only one jar was broken other items were not damaged even it means they smell of schezwan chutney and had oil inside and all over them. Even the sugarcane cubes had chutney inside them but they refused to replace the items.  2nd - I placed an order at 6.39am today which had milk and eggs plus other items in it. Needed few immediately for breakfast. I messaged the cc support team around 8am to check where my order was. They told me the delivery parten had not been alloted so they will allot another partner. I waited for good 15mins and then they tell me that there is a technical glitch and cannot allot a delivery partner hence cancelling my other.  And when I ask them to connect me to a senior or for a call back they have rhe audacity to say that rhis is the best they can do. Pathetic customer support and the quality of service and delivery had become extremely bad. Had really bad and disappointing experience off late. Don't think will continue with Swiggy anymore."
"Absolutely horrible!!! Very bad and pathetic customer team... had placed an order.. the entire food was spilled.. they took it back, swiggy cancelled it and WRONGLY CHARGED cancellation fee to me... customer support is USELESS.. they will simply waste ur time.. will not provide any solution... they did not even call back nor did they fix the issue nor did they reply on chat.. total WASTE of money..."
"Swiggy is a dacoit please guys be careful on ordering they will charge completely amount has a cancellation fee, , , and customer service they have been given training how to only loot customer and no help in just 5 min order cancellation they charged back complete amount"
"If you order icecream except when you are in locations less than 10c  you will be delivered with millk shake, swiggy takes rs50 delivery charge for rs70 icecream but does not carehow"
I am writing for the milk delivered on 4 th october.i am writing late as was waiting for their response.Swiggy does not bother for their customer.Their app needs update. No customer care numbers who respond .the milk delivered when boiled curdled. Who do i speak to.
I have ordered 2 items but received only one and paid for 2.. swiggy is not ready to pay back.. instid off finding problem swiggy said cannot be solved..
"I always order from Insta mart day in nd day out but it’s come to a point where I have to write this review nd never order again from Swiggy , they are always 1 or 2 products missing in the orders you placed nd instead of just sending them , they will refund ..so they can just add more charges to the delivery"
Never do prepaid order as swiggy has new technique to get money and not deliver orders. I used to do order many time but now swiggy is cheating with people. My order was not delivered and now they are not ready to refund my amount.
I received one wrong delivery and complained against this but swiggy customer executive closed the complaint without solving the problem.  This not first time so many time they are doing this.
I am utterly dismayed by the appalling quality of the cake I received from Classic Bakery via Swiggy. The spoiled cake not only shattered my surprise but also tarnished my special occasion. What compounds my disappointment is the complete silence from your end regarding my complaints. This level of negligence is simply unacceptable from a bakery of your supposed caliber. I demand an immediate refund and a thorough investigation into this matter. It is imperative that you rectify this grievous error and restore faith in your establishment promptly.
Punctual delivery personnel  Most of the time they are on time for delivery. Even with language barriers they try to make the client have some trust.  One person didn't know the location but was proactive in giving the product and was cordial.  Wouldn't mind ordering again ??
Always the orders are cancelled without intimation. They force you to accept cold order.  Zomato has got really good service
Why you are not accepted cash payment I don't have online then you don't delever my food at my destination why I
Since last five orders we are facing so much issue almost 1 hour they take to deliver with in kilometer and to cancel they say extra fees food reaches us un freshed and cold ...worst never prefer swiggy to any one
"Swiggy is given a 3rd class service no response from them after placing a order to McDonald's??????. They're saying we don't take orders, swiggy take the order but no reply from them, there rider informed me after 40 minit that .your order is cancel now at 1 am how can I get food. After 1 hour swiggy just give missed call and send message that your order cancelled."
"My order is canceled, they are charging cancelation fee on my next order with more money, please don't keep orders on swiggy"
"Initially the app was good with prices, deliver and offers.But currently I have to pay double the amount for whatever amount I am ordering for. They say delivery partner fee, delivery partner tip.  Damn...(Swiggy)you are running a business where I am your client and why should I pay for your workman....the Delivery persons work fo Swiggy, so you pay them the tip/ fee. GST good, restaurant packing charges good...why I have to pay the delivery people. I don't understand their theory.  I will definitely not recommend any Such app, instead people go get on your feet...there are always people who are fooling around us"
"I ordered something on instamart and got a different product. After chatting with an agent , I was given a replacement and it was the same wrong product.. again I chatted with an agent ( a different, slow and arrogant character) who tried conving me that what I ordered ( demerara sugar) is same as what I received( brown sugar).. he also said he cannot do anything more as I have not validated my claim!! What more did he need other than a picture of the Product I received and the bill?? He refused to pass me on to his supervisor (do they have one to escalate customer issues. I wonder) .. and as if a big favour issued me a refund!! I didn't want a refund, but just the product I ordered.. swiggy are you listening?? No more swiggying pl  Bad experience"
"I was ordered pizza through dominoz pizza on Sep 16, 2023 at 8.30 pm I was keep on check with dominoz shop till 10.30 pm but they said swiggy delivery persons not assigned to pickup before 11 pm they informed me to cancel the order since delivery not assigned till, I said ok please do it. Today 18th, 1pm still status shows order is on the way by dominoz pizza person and my amt also not credited to my account. I was paid to swiggy not to dominoz ? Very bad experience"
Aaj maine instamart se saman mangaya tha but delivery partner ne order delivery mark kiya but muze order nahi mila aur swiggy support third class service de raha hai and I suggest you don't order from swiggy
It's a very good food.Time is very punctual.and food quality is best.. Delivery partner is right time to food deliver.
Yesterday I got cheated with my money when I placed an order their delivery executive reached denied my location and later I got two executives reached me through chat & call one suggested to cancel the order and I will receive my money back to my bank account and the other one in the chat said the money got adjusted for cancellation. & after multiple calls they said to email me but later even after knowing everything they said it won’t get adjusted.. lol this is how they treat their customers thank god it was a small amount order.. I am boycotting Swiggy.
Waste app. I didn't get my order .they cancelled themself.delivery partner behaviour is not good ... Name :soyanu
I have started using swiggy instamart and found there us no rating system so delivery partners are trying to hide one or two items in their bags.  Once when some one else at my home received the order..at that time the delivery partner did not handedover the 5 kg fortune atta pack. After that incident i was more careful to check items what i ordered..again the partener hide the pack of butter and in next delivery try to hide the pack of bread and giving after only i strickly asked for..needs to improve for customers and also company's loss..
I dint get my order on time I canceled it I dint get refund and the order food as well as drink is not hot and cold worst
"I have ordered food for about 500rs it was 7:15 pm the area of restaurant I ordered was near my place.The order got confirmed it was showing 35mins for delivery. From 7:15pm till 2hours they've not having delivery executive and customer service person was very rude and was asking me to cancel your order and the money will not be refund. No respect for customer, no respect of time , no respect for people money and at last by 10:30pm the order got delivered. Very poor service from swiggy."
"On my complaint regarding delivery executive not being assigned, they asked me to contact delivery executive. Bunch of fools."
"We have ordered food from a very reputed restaurant /food chain, and been waiting patiently for 2 hours now. Swiggy team has been talking about low staff and other reasons. Not sure what is their intention. We are not going to cancel the order. Want to know the delivery time ....."
Had waited for an order for 71 minutes which was placed within distance of 1.5 km from our place. Delivery partner didn't pick calls .
"Very bad experience they take orders charge money from you and at the time of delivery they told you that you have selected a wrong location which you actually not able to check where you were wrong, then they cancel your order and deduct cancellation charge. Finally what you get nothing wastage of time and money ."
"I had ordered via swiggy, amounting Rs, . 1711, food was not delivered, though it showed delivered and when I called the delivery man Rinkesh, many times, he did not take my call.  When I called help customer care, the lady was of no help, except for parroting, sorry.... I can understand..... She was good for nothing. When I asked her to transfer the call to senior, she told me to email..... Just imagine.... I had ordered dinner and it was past 10:30 pm... I was trying to trace my dinner..... N she expected me to deal via email..... On my insistence, she acted to transfer my call and I was on hold for nearly 45 minutes and finally I disconnected the call....... This is the service they are providing... I have not mentioned the name of the girl..... But swiggy.... It's pathetic that u people cannot keep a track of your delivery man... Even they were not able to contact him.... Now it's 12 midnight and am still cracking my brains...... Following the invisible dinner of Rs1711/- and exemplary services of swiggy....  In nut shell, this app is a shammer.... Customer care services.... Hopeless... And delivery partner.... No words to describe"
When I saw some discount on swiggy i ordered from box8 vasai a meal... N let me tell u it's a comedy with a customer... Taste is poor... Then they have a small compartment of dal.makhni Ani lots of rice .. how can anyone eat that much rice with a such a small quantity of dal .. is it a joke .. if u can't then don't give such nonsense discounts... We order for our food need not because u are giving chutyastic discount and such nonsense quantity... Ok??? ... And this review will be posted everywhere possible... now ..
I had ordered food from swiggy. Got my sandwiches and wasn't delivered the soup. Now I followed up with all possible ways of communications and found out that it was delivered from the hotel but the delivery guy apparently hadn't delivered. Swiggy says that you'll not get a refund. So my money is lost. I will never order from swiggy again and request you guys to do the same.
"We had placed a bulk order, they took order we had paid. Then thier delivery partners had called and denied to diliver the order.  Then we ordered pizza, they delivered incomplete order.  Useless service  Better order from Zomato"
"I made an order through swiggy by mistake( I was calculating the charge and was choosing another food). I called the restaurant right away and said not to cook my order, and told me to cancel the order through swiggy customer service. They said they will charge still Rs 573(cost of the order) for the next order I place. I said I made the order by mistake and conveyed the restaurant not to make the order so that there is no food wastage and I conveyed it to swiggy. The customer service told me that if a cancelation had to be made, it should be made within one minute. Bad impression was made to me at that time. Keep up in this same manner. You guys will be washed away by zomato soon"
Idiots learn to deliver a food. You eat well and sit on a stupid bench and look out to our hunger problems. Idiots try to stay hungry and manage your stupid app idiots. can't deliver a food and claim to be pro's idiots....
Never going to use it ever. Placed the order by providing the full address information along with the current location. And still they asking to pick up the order by hallway because of the wrong information given by the app. Problem  on their side still they are not even ready to deliver the order either to refund. The customer service staff are not even capable of taking the responsibility and solve the matter. No value for customer's money. They were like we can't refund also we can't make the delivery. Like we have to give them money for free. Scam it is. The worst experience never going to use it ever plus not recommending to any. If you are doing a job atleast do it in a better way otherwise just quit.
Rating for Swiggy is not available it is there only for food or Delivery partner- if the partner is assigned from a far off place then whose fault is it ?
Swiggy- doesnt help if you arr not satisfied with the food. You are responsible for your money Swiggy will not help you anyways. Hence order wisely from Swiggy.They will simply says that they will take the feedback and your hard earned money gone for toss.
"It's a shame that you cancel our order when the food is about to get delivered. Waiting for one hour of the delivery time, after one hour u say that the order is cancelled. It's ridiculous on your part to cancel it."
"I sent a package using Swiggy Genie from Howrah, near Kolkata west bengal to Haltu, Kolkata on 26.08.2023 using the order id 152029942213056. I was updated that this will be delivered within 45 minutes. After almost 1 hr and 30 minutes, I called the delivery guy as he started moving backwards on the app. He went 10 km back from midway, he said he met with an accident and the item was lost. Firstly, if he met with an accident so severe that he lost his items, how he could travel back 10 kms within 20 minutes. I contacted swiggy and they said they will compensate me and asked for the bill details of the items.  However, now they have denied stating that there is a clause in their 733 lines ""Terms and conditions"" that they donot recommend sending valuable items. Who on earth thinks that baby products(feeding bottles, containers, feeding cloth) are valuable items and declined my request.  The closed the ticket stating the same, as attached in the picture. Scammers, thiefs, scamming people and looting their stuffs."
"It was a stale food and the food was smelling aa if it was kept from days. Please dont try to play with the health of customers. Also you have shitty customer support, we cant get in touch with the agents. No one gives a damn about us and our issues.  Zomato is the best and know how to serve the customers and best in customer support."
I have waited for 2 hours and still the food not delivered. I am running behind them to get the food delivered. The food is yet to be picked up. What kind of service?
No way to call. Institutions given while ordering not complied. Asked to mark happy birthday on cake not found. Packing sub standard
"Swiggy One membership for 3 months suddenly hiked from Rs. 199 to Rs. 549. Are you out of your mind? And you say ""You got a special discount "". Hilarious ??. Switching to Zomato and Blinkit. Do let me know when you come to your senses"
Ordered food  Called the Velet after 20 min he said madam it's a multi order cannot be delivered in 20 min he took 1 hour to deliver it and then without delivering it he marked the order as DELIVERED wat a fraud service they provide and after that also the food was not delivered they ate My hard owned money and not refunding it back
Very bad experience. I have ordered few things out of which cabbage was missing. Whole day they wasted in chatting with me and made me do multiple emails and then without refunding or sending the product they mailed back as problem resolved and ticket closed. Very bad part of them. This happened with me many times before too.
Not to be good  No fast delivery timing  Wrong information display on swiggy application  Rider where and location is where  Call are wrong mentioned in swiggy application  Not to good
"I am extremely unsatisfied with swiggy service. I had placed an order at 9:55Pm and my order was cancelled after 1 hour with out my knowledge and the customer service was not at all supportive, when asked them about my order they responded your order was cancelled from your side wherein I never cancelled my order and the money was also paid Rs.850 they are charged me for order cancellation. Also as per my knowledge there was no reason to cancel my order as I had updated complete address and when I am chatting on bot they are not giving proper reply they will say email us on support and after emailing them there is no reply, I don’t even have words what to tell about this organization very unorganized they are actually robbing money from people. I will never recommend to anyone."
"Ordred milk on Swiggy Instamart. The quality was so poor that when we put it for boiling the entire milk turn sour. On making complaint to Swiggy Instamart Support, they refused to accept and compensate the claim."
"Ordered food for my daughter today at 6.11 AM, showed in 20 mins the food will arrive , when I called the delivery executive, he said the food is not prepared, when I called restaurant, they gave me no visibility of when the food will be sent , he refused to give a response saying this is customer care, I wonder why have they given the contacts of people who can't even give a proper update. Then the food came at 7.10 and I refused to take delivery as my daughter had already left for her school by the time they came. Now to my surprise, I am being penalized for the irresponsible act of Swiggy and it's partners in not meeting the deadline, so they have levied a cancellation fees of the total value of the food that I had ordered in my account!! Isn't it insane to do that? Swiggy is taking its customers so lightly, we need to come forward to fight against them for such insane acts, instead of compensating for the delayed orders that was not even accepted , how can they even have this policy of penalizing the customer? A day before we ordered some items that were completely stale but they didn't do anything about it yet. Swiggy has become really horrible these days . Mouthshut is not allowing me to rate below 3 stars , I am not sure why."
I have ordered paan from @betelleafindore after 20 min they canceled my order and sent me msg that order has been canceled from my side only.. and no money will be refund. And if i have any issues then mail them and they will revert it after 24 hrs.. such thieves and cheaters
I ordered burger at midnight from Indiana Burger. along with the burger I got a disgusting looking insect inside the box along with the burger. there was no way I could convey this to the customer care and there was no refund for the same.  it is extremely unhygienic to order from these places. and this was my last order
"I had very bad experience with swiggy. Yesterday I was trying to order food of RS.870 in discount, payment was failed due to their error, 93 discount not applied on repayment with Rupay card, when called to customer care they refused to give offer and forces to pay full amount on cod. When I trying to cancel they are telling me fine of whole order amount and will be deducted from next order amount. On argument they agree to cancel my order without fine. Then I placed new order. I got my food 15 min late by promise time, also in my ordered food I got wrong food as well as uncooked, I sent them all evidence of uncooked and wrong food photos but for this complaint they give me only 20 RS. Coupon As compansation for my Rs.870 order. Total wastage of money. Me and my family are unhappy with swiggy. They are favouring to Food delivery partner not the customer. I will never recommended this app to anyone. Please delete this app from mobile and never trust such useless food delivery partner."
It’s pathetic. They show u delivery in 25-30 minutes but deliver food in more than 1.5 hrs. They keep searching ur location for hours. Even when u filled complete address
"I had orderd 600 ml of sprite along with other items from Oho Shawarma Hotel from Taloja Phase 1.At first they firgot to bring sprite and I raised a complaint regarding this.So after half an hour they supplied 250 ml .When I asked swiggy about this short supply, they are not ready to solve this issue evenafter I sent all the photographs as evidence.Swiggy is cheating the customer and refusing to give refunds."
"I have been using swiggy from three years now. I order food from restaurants around south Bangalore . But one day to my surprise I realised that swiggy charges 40 to 50% more on the dishes than the restaurant inspite of charging gst , handling and packaging charges, and delivery charges . For example one masala Puri from Rajathadri food fort Jayanagar costs Rs 50but swiggy charges Rs 95. A chocolate sandwich from Hari super sandwich costs 45 but on swiggy it’s Rs 79 . I mean this is just so unfair . I think consumers please be aware that u are paying excess for what is available cheaper . I have decided that I shall never order food from swiggy ."
"I ordered, bunch of items one with value saving thing it included one kg onions one kg of potato and 500gms of tomatoes, upon requesting an replacement as person delivered 2 kg of potato only, the chat executive which I suppose is an automated ai response bot , not an human so wasn't of much help also , and store is like 15 mins away they say and charged me rain fee , i even sent an pic of clear sky since morning it's not raining, they said it might not be raining in your area but near store ??which is laughable because store is littraly 10 mins away"
I ordered a sawarma chicken wrap today for lunch 1.5 hrs ago. I didn't received the order. The app is showing that the delivery boy had reached my location. I called him 4-5 times . He was not picking up the call. This is not done. Wastage of time. I was waiting for the food from last 1.5 hrs and ended up in getting nothing.
Delivered burnt cheese roll and then offered a coupon code for Rs 20 off. Terrible support team! Burnt food is a known carcinogenic!!
Out of three items ordered only two items were delivered. On reporting the issue to Swiggy on app and by e-mail first they did not cared and after repeated follow-up they said we can refund you Rs. 22/- if you accept . I asked what is the basis of Rs. 22/- when I have paid for missing item many times more than this. Without clarification answer was that we can refund only Rs. 22/-. and they closed the ticket. I was stunned to hear that even such companies are allowed to do business in country and there is no one to stop them from loot. They must be delivering partial order when they find high value order and exploiting the public for their limitation.
Missing items in order received. Reported issue to customer Support. Even after follow up no refund given for Missing items. Why one should use services from Swiggy if they are not reliable .
Swiggy.com is the best food delivery app in India in terms of customer support.  Infact it has the best customer support chat window option across all ecommerce and online portals in India.  The support team members respond quick and are customer friendly.The refunds are also easy and fast.  Only thing bad about Swiggy is that their delivery charges are hefty and they have lowest no.of restaurants onboard.  Sonetimes they charge even 100 rs.as delivery fee when the restaurant is just 200 mtrs away from your place.  Swiggy also has to improve upon packaging and delivery time.  Overall its good!
Extremely pathetic service. Their delivery partner does not deliver the order and mark delivered. They don’t even return the money. I did not get food in the middle of the night and money is also gone. Fraud company looting people.
"I have ordered some groceries like eggs, coconut dice, fruits cutting, onions, coriander leaves. It was very disappointed me as all the items r in very bad condition. Eggs were broken. Fruits cutting were not fresh, smell very badly, coconut cutting was not fresh it was very sticky and rotten, bad smelling. I have stopped ordering from there now."
Many times delivery partners are not my location but claim if I call that they are there and called me but I don’t pick a call where as no call received. After escalating matter to CS they give excuse or if you tell them to send love location they refuse by saying I can’t. Simply because they are enjoying your food somewhere else they are not at your place. I was asked by delivery boy to pay extra money just to move by 4 house where as already swiggy is charging 60 rs for delivery in the radius of 0.3 km. On top of that gst 40rs. The 199 rs dish becomes for 289. Plus they don’t refund money never use swiggy
They are doing a scam. Once amount paid for order then they cancel it later giving some illogical reasons and then charges all your paid money as fine.
"I placed an order on Swiggy for 3 sev puri and I kept on calling the restaurant not to make my sev Puri spicy but they kept on disconnecting the call , then I called Swiggy with the problem I am facing with my order but even then they were of no use and said you have to take the order how it is delivered and you can’t have it how you like it even after telling them several times they were a headache and didn’t solve my problem and forced me to take the order and pay and if I cancel it then also I have to pay to swiggy . Such unprofessionals who only live to extract extra money from customers and trouble them"
Thay are axepted the order. i was waited almost 2 hour but thay are not delivered my food finally i called to customer care and thay are asking again 30.mints worst service. Worst service
"I have ordered from Swiggy on 12 July , I had received incomplete order from the rider name Vishnu kumar . I had ordered 1 garlic combo and 2 medium size pizza for which I only got 1 garlic combo and One medium size pizza .  Shared Order id 172246781063 .  It is disgusting that having trust on Swiggy partner , your rider does these kind of things . That day was my anniversary on which have ordered and you people spoiled it . Please never order through Swiggy they cheated so many people and don’t regret also . Have tried customer care so many times but no response . So advising not to order from swiggy."
I am also use the app and never late delivery. My order is still hot and good quality. Its delivery service is nice
"I got super irritated with swiggy I tried to order my food I waited for 2 hours not the executive is available not the person is chat is available I don't know what the heck are they doing, have no update and this is not worth it I am sorry I am really really disappointed."
Delivery taken more than 1.5hr. Really frustration support.No customer care support.Never order from swiggy
"Please stay away from Swiggy as they are day robbers, When I tried to order Milk Halwa from Swiggy it costs 183+34 delivery charges+ Restaurant charges 36+ Platform fee 2+ Handling charges 24 however when I got the same from Ganga sweets it costs me only 150."
"SWIGGY INSTAMART should be the last place for you to buy items as these ppl are bloody chors. They do not have cash on delivery option and once money paid they will throw any rotten item on your face. No call centre, no customer service to talk. Your money is gone for good and you wil get chatbot reply for better experience in future. Go for BLINKIT much better service and most of all hears and solves the issue."
I never see the worstest app like swiggy.  There is not even a proper customer care support.  They Deducting money unnecessarily.  After deducting the unnecessary amount they not even attend the phone call and also the line was not connected properly.  I have ordered food in swiggy. First time the amount was deducted from my account. But I recieved a message from swiggy if the amount was deducted it will be refund in 4-7 days. But the amount was not refunded yet. When I tried to call the customer care. The line was not connected properly. Poor customer care services.
"When it comes to rude and disrespectful customer care executive, swiggy wins hand down. Not only are their rates higher than Zomato, they arent customer friendly or helpful. Not only you don't get your food or a refund , on bad food, if you raise a complaint they ply  you with continuous back to back calls for no reason and shout at you for raising the complaint.Sorely disappointing. Sticking with Zomato.  Dr.Hussain"
I was busy with work and this gujjar delivery boy came and then it looks like the doorbell wasn't working. He just pressed the bell and stood there without trying to knock the door. Then after 1 minute I got a call from the customer care and I immediately went to open the door. How will I know he was standing there if he didn't knock the door. I asked who is he to tell me that the doorbell has to work or not and if he doesn't have the sense to knock if he didn't hear any sound of the bell. He then said I have to keep a doorbell in my house that is the rule. Then he started abusing me and he began beating me up like anything. I was bleeding from my mouth also. He said he is a big gujjar and I better learn.
One day I ordered some grocery from Swiggy. Delivery guy Hrikrishnan came to me location and ask me to come down I said no I am working actually its a door step delivery. He called me again & again I said you don't come you take the item back I will talk to customer service. He came to my door step since I was working I asked my wife to collect the item. He refused to give the delivery and call your husband when I went He started abusing and beating me and also said just you come out I will kill you. Actually from face and body language he looks like criminal.
"I am a regular customer, for last couple of months they r taking hours to generate bill and sometimes failing and lot of request produces duplicate bill which does contain required detail to get office reimbursement. Delivery boy also does not carry hard copy."
Very poor service. My order was delivered after 2.30 hours only after contacting the customer service
Swiggy is not giving refund to customers. Swiggy is promising for refund bt not crediting amoun to bank account. SWIGGY IS MKNG FOOLS TO CUSTOMERS
Swiggy delivered older food from resturent. Yesterday myself was not getting food....some rain fall was there and was requested that guy please wait but he do not cooperated....ultimately my food was not rea
"I had ordered icecream from swiggy on 16July, they have delivered me icecream which was already expired on 15thJuly, i didnt noticed expiry date, after having this icecream I had stomach upset and too much of gas, after getting well little bit when I noticed icecream was expired, due to which I had all these issues and I complaint in swiggy, they replied me saying they cannot do anything for this as I have reported this after more than 24hours of delivery.is this service for which we are paying charges."
Disastrous Customer Complaint Service! It doesn't have proper timely communication with customers and restaurant.Also very poor in handling customer complaints.
"I like grocery shopping in swiggy instamart very fast delivery in just 15 minutes. They offer all item like milk, tea powder, potato, and tomato all are very good in quality I like the site very much and again order have a nice day !"
"Hi toxshi viewers in this review were going through Indians emerging food logistics and delivery partner swiggy . Swiggy was founded back in 2014 by 3 co founder nandanreddy, Rahul and shriharsha with their headquarters in Bangalore with aim to provide same day packed food from nearby restaurants to home now expanding in grocery segment with instamart and subsidiary superdaily dine out under parent company bundl technologies with over 6500 employees majority delivery executive based on contact.Personally concept at that time was exceptional but nowadays it at certain points feels useless as majority of restaurants themselves providing their dishes along free dilevery also at instances when I ordered food from certain stores or outlets be it pizza or any South Indian store is way more affordable inspite of all those lucrative offers app possess or claims to interface is something they need to work on especially at time of sign up more over delivery executive at time provide stale food and dishes and at time of complaint executive asks you to connect that particular store or restaurant in short no accountability for sure to add to this misery late delivery is trend after 20 minute delivery or fast delivery on hold in certain regions also if you cancel your order way before it's prepared they charge you thefty amount and your gold membership is ruined despite of all earlier payment even lodging complaint against penalty no action are taken even after months not weeks also uncomfortable and inappropriate ads and at time unwanted calls from their sales executive even in certain regions they tends to charge more amount for delivery basically in Delhi NCR..mOst shocking above this they tend to supply dishes from other restaurants without looking into it whether store is authentic (Pure :veg ) or not for strict vegetarians and those who are on those fast that's my time viewers this is toxshi adios amigo but not to forget your favourite dishes to write down in comment section and mention any instance you faced from company do let me know waiting for you on other side till then stay tuned and connected......."
Awful.add subtract.none of business.food order - you can provide or not - simple answer highly appreciated ??
Swiggy dine out has pathetic services. They are misleading customers...their buffet page says offers like 2800 for two and restaurants charged me 2400 plus taxes for one person  If you call up swiggy customer they say it is approx amount whereas no where it is mentioned it is approx and you end up paying huge amount in the hotel
"Swiggy is the best one of the platform for the delivery  Because, I can order the food form swiggy the food is good  That's why swiggy is best"
"Recently we were in Puri and ordered food from Fisherman's kitchen worth Rs.1914 and when the food was delivered we discovered that 2 items worth Rs. 347 are missing, immediately I raised a complaint with Swiggy and as per their instructions sent images of the items received. Called the restaurant also and they said that they are aware and they will refund the money but sorry to say nothing happened. Since then I have been following up with Swiggy and today they sent a mail stating that the can't do anything and offered me coupon worth Rs. 66. It is a joke I think and the company is run by bunch of Jokers. I don't know what to do and who to approach because they are a big company but indulged in sheer cheating the consumer. You can't trust them anymore because once the money is paid you may not receive any food.  Another instances with them, I booked for genie to pick up some sweets for my friend and deliver to his address. The delivery guys refused to pick up the sweets and Swiggy deducted hefty fine and refunded few Rs. Being a Non Resident I could not do anything but had to forfeit the money for the sweets as well as Swiggy fees.  I am done with them for good but advising others to think twice before using their service anymore. Do you want to make a cheat richer?"
Please don't use this swiggy to place the order. They were cheating.no refund amount for the placed order.
I have ordered yesterday for Two burger bye approximate 9:00 p.m. which I didn't received until 1:00 a.m. in midnight and while in the morning it's showing delivered to me by approximate 5:45 a.m. yesterday I tried calling lot of times to your delivery boy in starting 7 to 9 times she didn't respond my call later he received my call but he said that my bike has some problem I am unable to come over there then I told him that you come by auto I will pay for the fare after that I called again and again lot of times to him but he didn't came and delivered my order. Stop the flooring by swiggy and swiggy delivery boys. I am going to launch the complaint against swiggy to consumer court and also going to make viral all the screen recordings and screenshots call recordings to digital media. Kindly find attached screenshots.  Thanks for your reply
Swiggy is actually good and I love it ...but I just have a small request.....that is to have the pay on delivery option also cause sometimes if the online payment doesn't work we could opt cash on delivery....I have faced problems sometimes on online payment method so I was requesting for cash on delivery option too.....  Before covid we had cash on delivery option so please bring that option back fo all restaurants or any other service....  Please sort out this payment problem soon.  Thank you
I am highly disappointed with Evergreen restaurant. I ordered kalakand from Evergreen Dwarka through swiggy. They had sent some very bad quality sweet which was not at all consumable. I have been struggling to get the refund or the replacement but none of my concern has been taken care. I blame swiggy as well for not taking any action to resolve my complaint. All they are sending me standard reply that we have forwarded your feedback to the restaurant and next time they will take care of that. My question is what about this time? What if by mistake we would have consumed it and lately we face food poisoning and landing to the hospital? None of them are taking the responsibility. I will never recommend anyone to order from them and from now onwards one should really think twice before placing any order through swiggy as they are least concerned about your health and money. They are stealing money from you by anyhow.
I have order the panner chilli in SWIGGY in midnight but there order is left from 2hours so there agencies and there products are not good so there productivity and service is not well so I have may be can't buy in SWIGGY
"Hi My order was not delivered by Swiggy also delivery executive is not responding, Swiggy team is not responding properly also I am fed up with standard chats and reply worst service"
"Last night mai swiggy app se order Kiya but jab order delivered huya to ek product missing tha or jab delivery boy ko awaz lagaya tab tak chala gaya or phir maine swiggy chat room Mai Jaa ke complaint Kiya magar kyo proper response nahi mila bas mr. Sandeep ye bolte rahe ki mere hand mai nahi hai, kitna poor service or unprofessional hai ye so aap sab swiggy se"
Ordered food on 08.07.2023 from meghana foods @10:15pm. Ordered accepted but not delivered. Wait time was 25 min. Food picked by agent but not delivered.waited till 12. Customer care response from 4 agents contacted was please cancel the order we will refund. Waiting till midnight for delivery and starving and this is the response. Pathetic service. Not fit to be in service industry.
"Title: Disappointing Experience with Swiggy Instamart  I had a disappointing experience with Swiggy Instamart recently. I ordered a few items, but two of them were missing from the delivery. These missing items cost me 400 rupees.  Despite reaching out to Swiggy Instamart's customer support, they refused to acknowledge the missing items or provide a refund. Their lack of responsiveness and unwillingness to address the issue left me frustrated and dissatisfied.  I provided evidence of the missing items, but each interaction with customer support yielded unhelpful responses and no resolution. This poor customer service and disregard for customer satisfaction were disheartening.  I caution potential customers to be careful when using Swiggy Instamart's services. Their failure to rectify their mistakes and their lack of concern for customer satisfaction are concerning. My hope is that they take this feedback seriously and make necessary improvements to their customer service and complaint resolution processes.  Overall, my experience with Swiggy Instamart was highly unsatisfactory, and I cannot recommend their services based on this incident."
"Swiggy is very convenient. It offers a variety of restaurants to order from, also here it's easy to find something according to your likes and tastes.  Talking about its interaction with user UI, is very user-friendly and one can easily navigate. Ordering process is very simple and order is delivered on time. It's services are very good and very fast and reliable.  Swiggy is one of the best food ordering and delivering app from the restaurant.  We can order anything at anytime by simple click on app which does not only saves time but also provides benifits to purchase anything from anywhere."
"Didn't get my order till one hour It shows 10 mins since half an hour. It beeing 45 min after pickup my order.. I called that swiggy agent he was saying i ll take 2 more order then i ll come. then i tell that delivery man take my food with, i don't want food. Very disappointing and very ridiculous service."
Anyone who has a Swiggy one membership knows the value of it as the delivery charges waiver makes a huge difference. I had ordered a fried rice from popular resturant nearby for merely 100 bucks with discounts and free delivery waiver.
"Hi , I am a well known member of Swiggy team.  I have a lot of people who are willing and likely to join Swiggy, but there is an issue in which the delivery boys have been facing this issue where the Swiggy support staff are not willing to help the ones that are the face of Swiggy.  Without any delivery boys the whole Swiggy thing is useless ediotic and to those who are delivering there time out , these people sitting under a roof in a chair chit chatting with colleagues and enjoying there time will never tend to help the delivery boys who are in trouble.  I just want to know that Why do u guys deduct amount without any proper guidance or proper response before you decide to deduct amount from the employee without any information."
Ma swiggy ma delivery ka kaam karta hu costumer ki mistake hai but penalty mera par laga Diya yaha log din bar garmi delivery karta hai yaha log costumer ko khus karna ka liya hum logo ki salary cut karta hai
Many times got wrng prdcts bt no refund from their app n no response it's a fake n fraud app  Dnt order anything
I ordered non veg biryani the piece of chicken is smelling like 2 days before making. Then I complained to coustomer care the madam says sir please avoid the one or two star restaurant
"Whenever the items ordered from the restaurant is changed and delivered , swiggy customer support asks for proof of photos and say they will communicate to the restaurant and closes the chat as ‘resolved’. Swiggy is already charging more than the actual restaurant bill excluding taxes and delivery fee, but not taking responsibility for changed orders. If we go to the restaurant and such things happen, we can directly inform and change our order. But in this online delivery platform , they have to be responsible and give a refund for such issues or deliver the correct items ordered . Worst service even after paying high charges!"
They don’t have quality to serve  We ordered paneer tikka sandwitch and they sent burnt bread bad experience
I Ordered a dal khichdi for my mom as she is not well and I am not with her. to feed her I ordered a dal khichdi worth rupees 170 and the delivery partner denied to drop my parcel and made a statement that I put an wrong address but I did gave the correct address. but they eaten my parcel and not refunded my money they are literally a thief.
"Very third class service from onboarding team no any responsible person swiggy has no operation manager about resturant esscalation , no any manager pick up the call , no given solution very very poor service ....contac information  Name - ganesh  Contac - 7559355518"
This guy is fraud and he is laughing and saying i have eaten your paneer butter masala plus all rotis were missing. If you are going to give services like that i am gonna use zomato from now. Please take strict action for this i have spoken with restaurant they confirmed they have given the whole order. Its swiggy who is responsible that means this guy is damaging your reputation please take this to consideration and deal with him as per your understanding. His contact number is 950942XXXX. Otherwise i will gonna escalate this to next level please provide me with your area manager email or contact number. I will not entertain this kinda behavior  Order number - 171315355897
"Swiggy instamart is a worst, recently I've ordered items some not delivered, some are wrong quantities & some are expired.  Their chat center is not ready refund or exchange the product also.  That do not have call center also.  Shared all photo also but still no resolution.  Big time cheater.  Do not buy any this from swiggy instamart."
Waste of money. We will order one item they will send another item which I's different from WT thy showed us. Placed ordered of seer fish first time thy sent wrong product finally they refunded the amt. Same issue after a week I ordered the same thing. If they font have that product they should remove it instead should not send some other product whichever they have in hand. Simply telling wd can't help in anyways sorry also they blocked in app like I can't sent any mess in chat.
"I have used other food delivering apps which never disappointed me. On swiggy I had ordered an almond mocha flavor ice cream from a famous restaurant keventers Bangalore and received chikoo flavor. When I called Restaurant, they answered amd then switched off. On complaining with Swiggy, they outright denied responsibility and asked me to leave a feedback and rating for the restaurant. On requesting again, they just closed the case without any resolution.  This is unprofessional and very bad. I went in loss."
"Just deleted the Swiggy app. Worst stale food. When I complained the bad food, they say they are not responsible, restaurant is. But the money I spent for food goes to them first and to the hotel. They should take responsibility for such terrible food. Food was sour and they reheated old food and delivered by Swiggy. After complaining they don’t take any action or refund for their pathetic service."
I was placing the items in cart and pressed back button it automatically took the order as COD. I spoke to customer care they cancelled the order but without even informing me they charged the complete cost as cancellation fees
When I ordered it says 30 mins and after 60 mins still says few more mins. then we call swiggy customer care the name is abhishek the idiot guy is saying sorry sir your order is delay and we have cancelled your order this is swiggy service. and the delivery guy name Manish he is saying come to the outside and take your order because I am not delivered your order to you delivery address then I am say why you are not deliver my order to my delivery address he saying sir I am busy and I am going to deliver anther order.  So guys siwggy service is wrost service.
Last day i ordered one food item from the swiggy..by mistake we are selected one food item and we payed it about 1272 rs. At that time we cancelled that that order... because we want to order another food item...but they taken full amount rs 1272 .. And they are saying it's a cancellation fee....100 % . I am a regular customer of swiggy...and my friends also using this application...first time this type of very very bad experience swiggy provide....we are deleting this swiggy application....
"After paying online, they sent a messege, 'don't worry we are sending your order and you can pay on delivery' this seema really pathetic, no cordination at all. We have no relaxation after ordering the food, because we have to make understand delivery boy first 10-15"
I ordered from kfc which had a deal everything for 179 for the day. For waiting for more than 1 hour i got an automated call saying there is a heavy rush and your order is being delayed.After further waiting i called delivery partner who starting complaining himself how he is being made to wait for one hour outside and not allowed to go inside.And being lied that the order is cancelled. Here we are waiting and there the poor chap. Restaurant is not picking out calls. I reached out to swiggy customer care. They also tried reaching several times but cudnt. After 1.5 hours of waiting my order was finally cancelled. Pathetic experience!!! Never expected of KFC. If they can't handle so many orders why do they start such offers. Highly unprofessional attitude!!!
First the send a damaged product then differnt super visor promise you refund multiple times in written. Then making an excuse after 2 days that the agent did some mistake . Then lower the refund which was promised so I did not took any thing back and just deleted the app
Swiggy is nightmare. We are Shiva Realty and Katemodel consultants ordered food from swiggy. The money was deducted from Gpay but food was never delivered. There is no function in app to contact customer care or restaurant.
Worst and burnt food provided for rs 1100 and no refund no food food provided either. Food was ordered from big bowl and subway. Shared pics as well but no action taken and when requested to close the account they just mentioned to uninstall the app and sign out from devices. Such a nasty experience
"I ordered chicken biryani with chicken tikka and a gulab jamun, but I received the order after an hour with just egg biryani. I raised complain immediately requesting to cancel the order and refund. As there is no chance to talk to any customer executive and communication all was through email and chatbot on Swiggy app, it's like whatever they wanted to say we had to listen. Through email they straight away denied to refund any amount on the order. They gave 15% of the order value as coupon to use on next order. It's cheating, since I paid almost double for the order than what I received. It's a direct cheating on the customer for money."
Provided the smelly and stale food after waiting more than 1 hour for delivery and I didn't eat that food throw it on dustbin no such resolution there
When I ordered it says 20 mins and aftr 70 mins still says few more mins and when I asked where is my order on chat the swiggy guys keep on saying the delivery guys not answering and thn rudely asking do u want refund or replacement.. they are so so Rude as if we are getting free services
Had ordered a cake at midnight for a friends birthday and had selected a correct address but the location sent to the Swiggy delivery boy was my office address which was closed at night after speaking and trying to convince the customer support person who gave me fake name “Bubble” for a long time they were not ready to understand and eventually the delivery was cancelled and the amount paid was not refunded
"I have placed an order at 6.30 pm today but received at 7.45 pm after almost more than an hour waiting, I have ordered this for some one special as surprise but u have made mood off .  Delivery partner was not accepting calls more over the team connected with me after a long delay .  So please do not place any order through swiggy ."
I order from swiggy before time the i get message that my order was deliver i called many times to the delivery boy he didn’t picked up my call i take a help from from swiggy chat but they are not proper responding on my chat im attaching delivery boy no. And swiggy caht . Going to complain on cyber crime against them.
"Very worst services, Their delivery man doesn’t pick phone and they roam at different different locations, probably doing some other work, they say that they are unable to get the address, which is very clearly showing in GPS.  The delivery man was doing delivery on cycle and probably he don’t know to operate the Swiggy app also.  This is how Swiggy doing the delivery , that fellow don’t even have any regretted also."
Ordered a grilled fish with veggies got a call from restaurant they don't have it. Offered to give chicken in same quantity with chicken burger and drink. When received no drink was the there. Chicken was not cooked so cooked at home. Still very difficult to eat. Tried a lot to get refund half or full but didn't got. Previously got a refund on delivery of wrong items. So feel like it got adjusted in it. Previous amount 500 now 360. I don't trust them. This time ok luckily due to previous refund as I ate what was given. But difficult to trust them. Food is expensive and a lot of time goes to get a suitable deal and hardly you get one of average quality.
I ordered non veg noodles they delivered me veg noodles and this is not over they delivered me uncooked food. I complaint about it they first took 24 hours to reply and after they investigate the matter they saw all image which I uploaded in mail. after that they sent me Rs 36 coupon  can you imagine you order for Rs 200 and you get spoilt food and they give you 36 Rupees as a compensation.
"I placed an order with burger King on 5th June and later I received a call from delivery boy Lakhwinder Singh who Don't now how to speak with the customer and reached wrong address. Later I received a call mentioning that they don't deliver the item at my location it's far away, if you don't deliver at my place then why you took the order and the lady in the call center cancelled my order charging me cancellation fees for their own mistake. I was embarrassed infront of my friends, never use this service. (Your Swiggy order #169011546168 has been cancelled . You will be charged Rs 387.0 as cancellation fee.)"
"They taken order and not yet delivered .  They told us, it is not possible to deliver and cancel this order after conforming order .  Now a days they charged per order 100 and plus .  This leads to swiggy CEO is richer and richer and no service quality YET ALL .  Bad service and charged more money .  So ALL , pls stop swiggy orders ."
Today I have a bad experience..i order from pizza Hut after taking the order the delivery guy denied to delivered the order bcz it's to far from him to deliver after so much waiting he says that we send him wrong location.if it's far from him to deliver why they confirmed order.now I have to pay cancellation fee for nothing
If you think too order food from this app i m suggesting you to not the customer care services is worst the have zero solution only one thing they can do is call you thousand tym and say only one thing you can do cancel it cancel id never ever understand your problem show zero sentiments worse service always having issues with food delivery partner and at the end the swiggy customer care warning do not use this app otherwise your gonna rue
Swiggy needs to improve when we keep cash on delivery swiggy delivery partners are not keeping change this is a problem which hasn't arised with Amazon or Flipkart etc cash on delivery...
"I had quite bad experience of swiggy when my order gave an error post payment. Swiggy doesn't send any confirmation of order other than app itself so when I didn't see it, I fairly assumed that order didn't happen and in such cases money should come back in few days. I ordered again.  Swiggy then delivered both my orders and not ready to accept their fault because they don't have anyway to see their own app errors or probably they don't want to. I had not taken a snap of error so after 3 month of fake investigation they simply refused to accept mistake other than just saying sorry, take care next time ??.  Please be very cautious of swiggy qnd take snap when you see an error as otherwise onus is on you to prove that some error happened. Swiggy is ready to blame restaurant for food and delivery person for delays but not ready to own any accountability for their app issue. Great going swiggy, i will part my ways from you."
I have ordered an icecream cone costing rupees 124 and they have provided one of the oldest stock with cones broken and icecream oozing out completely leaked twice of me ordering from instamart when reached out for refund or replacement they declined my request for refund saying all they can do is say sorry providing old stock and looting people with high rates shame on you instamart you can't loot people's money like this you either provide them good stuff or shut ur business
I am never gonna order anything from swiggy instamart they guys are cheating with their customers taking the full amount of product and sending incomplete product with half quantity and then what should I do with Sorry when you are not able to provide any resolution to your customers /how fake is swiggy I can't believe this.Swiggy will not value their customers and also there hard earned money. Really Disappointed
"Worst experience, price and quantity, dikhaya kuch aur Diya kuch, 100rs ki chiz ke 265rs liye."
"Very frequent intrusive Advertisement of Swiggy Dineout, making it difficult to focus on work. I will be uninstalling SWIGGY after this review."
Pathetic way of earning money by adding extra price on every dish. And also poor customer service.  Please please stop using Swiggy and teach them a lesson.  I wish the CEO of swiggy reads all the reviews and be ashamed of himself.
In pondicherry I ordered in swiggy for 2 pizza and the location is Villianur manaveli.  The person do not know the place.  What a service u r having nobsen  It is a paid item.  He told because of not knowing the location  I will not deliver  His name Vasanth
I ordered lunch today and delivery location is pinned wrong but address mentioned is correct. even though delivery guy is not willing to give the order as he has reached the pinned location. What customers can do for system errors and swiggy team is unable to resolve issue with delivery guy. Worst experience and not came across such
Hi swiggy is on of the food delivery application and in this app build is very slow and this location places are not delivered.when I have ordered the delivery boy comes very late.  And this operating system is very less and its give very bad Experience and food are not fresh and clean totally I am not setisfy to this app .
Very bad experience I have faced they did not order properly and instead of being a sorry not collect the proper food they are saying they will retuned only 10 Rs out of 76 Rs.  Please don't be fooled by Swiggy. I will suggest to order your food with zometo having a good experience with zometo thumbs up to zometo. And thums down to swiggy.  please don't become fooled by swiggy
Very very bad Swiggy customer contact me 962038xxxx aise cheat karna achcha nahin hai na aapko aapka yah bada brand hai usko aap Paisa chat karoge mere ko bahut gussa hai
Very worst kind of behaviour from both the delivery partner and the customer care executive who told me to get the order where 200 mts away .  I have never seen this kind of worst customer service.. very very very bad swiggy.
NEW STRATEGY OF SWIGGY TO LOOT INNOCENT CUSTOMERS !!!  SWIGGY REMOVE CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER  NOW THEY ARE HAVING RELATIONS SUBSTANDARD RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY CHAINS. IF YOU ORDER GROCERIES OR FOOD AND THEY ARE STALE YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING BUT LOOSE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. SWIGGY FRAUDULENT CHAT SERVICE WILL REJECT ALL YOUR COMPLAINTS AND NEVER REFUND. THEY WILL CHAT WITH YOU FOR HOURS AND ASKING DETAILS AND THEN WILL DENY THAT NOTHING IS WRONG STJ THE FOOD OR GROCERIES THEY SENT. VERY GOOD AND CLEVER MOVE BY FRAUDULENT SWIGGY. WE NEED TO BOYCOTT SWIGGY !!!
"Horrible service you pay twice for the half quantity, I compared the food purchased via App and going to restaurant to eat the same item listed in menu."
"I suggest everyone not to believe hashtag#swiggy, if you are hungry and looking for a reliable delivery partner then never choose hashtag#swiggy, The delivery status which are shown after order confirmation is completely fake, they will keep you waiting for hours and finally order will be cancelled or they will not be able to find the delivery partner, Here I am sharing an incident, I placed an order(Order ID: 167647524769, they confirmed my order and after an hour I got a call that it would be delivered in 30 min, so I waited another 30 min but no one came, So I called the customer care to know the order status, then they informed me that it cant be delivered, so ultimately I waited for 2 hours and then I had to order from its competitor, which is much better and reliable, Thanks swiggy for wasting my time and showing your excellent customer support, Keep it up, I will suggest each of my friend to stop ordering from swiggy and will continue posting these kind of memorable experiences on social media."
"I ordered Girmit, a north indian snack which costs around ₹99 in one & around ₹ 48 but the total was in ₹164 & ind in the other ₹125 which amounts to almost double of what the snack costs. This is really too much. We'll have to think twice before we order, Really unjustifiable charges"
"Be aware Instamart Swiggy a complete fraud.  Within a span of Three days We have been cheated to a tune of 650/-  First she ordered for frozen peas 2kgs and got tomatoes refused to take it from the delivery person, on request by that guy to raise a online complaint and based on earlier experience we trusted but inspite of repeated mails no response.  After that again day before ordered a Tandai drink on opening she found it to be expired same procedure again simply sorry but nothing can be done. I am hereby alerting all of you. I have proper bills and all the mails connected to the transaction.  Kindly share this message till it becomes viral."
Mane yaho oder diya Tha lunch box. Ka swiggy Mai and this happened with me same on 2nd thim oder is very bad ju packing Tha boat hi ganda Tha.  Food is vebad mane jub oder ka complete Kiya so they are giving me 48 rs  Last time also happened they're give 38 rupesh mane vo pase nahi liye the and kaha Tha oder ripl
Ordered two Thalis via Swiggy. Food was packed in plastic bags dumped in bigger bag instead of containers. It is so off putting. Except for daal rest of food was pathetic. Loaded with tons of garlic killing delicate flavors. When will Puneites realize that spicy food need not be liberally cooked in garlic. Will never order again from this joint.
In today's order product was missing.  I asked customer care to deliver it or refund the money.  But he said he is unable to deliver the product or refund the money for the same.  Now a days this happened in every order.  In my previous order I received damage products when asked to replace it.  Customer care said not possible next time will be careful.  It means they pick up the cash in advance and then they don't deliver the good quality products or don't deliver all the products as per payments.  Vry poor customer service and quality of the products.
This is what you get response when they deliver unsealed items to your doorstep. Don’t know what sort of checks in place before sending the products to consumer. And top of that the response you get from customer-care people is gold.
"The price of the items enlisted with the app is too high. If not, then the additional charges hike them. On top of it, poor customer support. Even attending to the queries takes them so long, forget about providing any solutions."
I placed the order after 1hr and 20 minutes i received the ordrer put the complaint...the chatting executive was worst as he was responding to each sentence after 10 minutes i asked for supervisor which he connected after 1 hr and 15 minutes ...that supervisor also did not take any action ..the worst customer care
As their was no storage space for an app on phone for downloading swiggy app so I ordered online on the birthday 11 may 2023 of a close relative for the 1st time ordered on swiggy order no.#166883553942 address was right when bill generated it was showing somehow different location but the address I gave was right I immediately informed to deliveryman to delivr at the address mentioned got a reply that I am getting only rs 20 for this delivery will not go Pimpri Pune to the address and will deliver at the location which was showing wrong address received a phone call from customer care asked me to change the location online tried many time but the location was not edited on getting this information the customer care cancelled my order by saying we deliver to the location and not to the address mentioned and my order was cancelled with no refund though the address was right so my day and money waisted.
"By oversight we placed an order for Surf excel and Comfort conditioner twice. When we tried cancelling one of the orders, the person on chat responded that if I cancel the order, I will not get any refund. Just aweful customer care who have no other agenda but to grab one’s money. Please improve your customer grievance redressal department who have no courtesy whatsoever"
"Disgusting service. They are liars , putting the blame on the delivery partners. Complete cheats and they destroy a customers evening. Never again will I use them. They lie to customers. Hope they’re taken to task"
The delivery guys on this app don’t bother reaching or trying to find your place if the order has been pre paid for and end up just cancelling it in spite of you calling and giving them instructions on how to reach ur place! Total SCAM! The customer support just wastes your time by saying sorry theres nothing they can do about it!
"Swiggy. Delivery boys are behaved very rude manners against existing customers. So, Thus, have to be improved more and more."
I am ordering on daily basis from Swiggy and all the time they show 20-30 min. but never delivers the order before 1 hour.  So don't order from Swiggy unless you have plenty of time to wait.  Zomato delivery partner network is much better. I will not recommend Swiggy anymore.
"They scammed me for 670 rupees for a spilled food and refused to give money back or order replacement they are a worst andpathetic scammers , bycott them."
"Have the highest abusive team, every alternate delivery guy comes abuses and goes, somehow till building they'll come and call and speak rude till you go, while handling the food gives threats, there has been time when one guy put hand inside window to start a fight broke curtain because hands didn't reach to anything else, price is double on app, delivery fee is highest, customer support is higher than highest, don't know what these people are high on but never ever till date any issue has got a resolution only template response anything you ask same template is pasted, the moment they get 10 second chat delay end the chat itself, leave in between the chats, will never check history, in the name of different team or senior just pass the chat to next colleague who will again do the same thing provoke you make sure you go through the pain again and again till the time you start feeling depressed and lost  I've kept a track of last 2 years their is a abuse or harrasment if you are lucky physical harrasments also will be delivered, you would complaint to them they will pass around the phone in name of team, support will make sure you get provoked and do something or get to a depressed stage, and finally lose the ticket on 2md day in the name of call it'll be misscall, or someone will call and speak faster than mutual fund ad and disconnect  Over the last couple of years they've helped in increasing my stress to a level where feeling lost is small word, you would get tendency of not being alive at all, telling them not to call that is provoking thoughts more towards negetive side, high on what they have to call only, that intention even after telling so much he didn't stop, they depress and provoke you to a level, imagine having a life and death thought and these guys provoke more with their stupid communication and templates which will make you kill yourself, basically murderers they are, their delivery guys do crime legally like stealing, robbing threatens openly, when you complaint the depression and harrasments increases more.  Biggest liars they did promise a compensation or they will help me go legal for the issues, if the inconvenience happens ever again, it happened today, no point for guessing template was sent 4 hours chat went, the guy just kept randomly sending template without even reading the issue  No one was bothered to go and check the previous complaints, only line sir we wil take action 48 hours and empathy"
"Horrible Horrible service  Partial delivery, refusal of delivery boy to deliver the remaining part, threatening phone calls from delivery boy since I told him that I will escalate the matter, endless wait with customer service on chat, refund only for delivery related charges but not the amount of missed delivery."
I put 2 orders on swiggy simultaneously at same address. 1 got delivered and other was denied by the delivery boy claiming wrong address. He himself cancelled my order and my full order value was deducted as cancellation charges which was not done by me. Moreover there is no one giving a decent explanation. Horrible service and customer service
"2 incidents  1) few days back i bought Idly batter and they send me 1 day to expire PRODUCT, when complaint NO ACTION AS THEY SAY , EMAIL AND WHEN YOU MAIL , THEY SAY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REFUND OR EXCHANGE  2) today may 1st 2023 , they sent me items short by rs 212 short,  BOTH THE INCIDENTS WHEN I COMPLAIN, THEY SIMPLY CLOSE THE CHAT SAYING THAT THE TICKET IS CLOSED AND THEY CANNOT REFUND NOR DELIVER THE SHORTAGE ITEMS , SO MANY MAILS I SENT BUT WITH ZERO ACTIONS  I THINK THEY ARE IN TREMENDOUS PRESSURE OF LOSSES , BETTER DONT BUY OR ENCOURAGE SWIGGY DANGEROUS GUYS BIG BASKET IS EXCELLENT"
I ordered from Burger King something and it was not delivered yesterday and instead it was marked as delivered....I informed and there is no response about my refund either... Horrible service
"This is the first time that I ordered something and it did not delivered to me and instead it was marked as delivered and delivery partner was not picking my call too , very pathetic experience with Swiggy"
"Ordered breakfast at 8.30 am. Restaurant located Only 3.5 km from my place , even at 9.30 am food is not delivered and delivery executive is not picking the phone , customer support called and asked if I need to assign any other executive ?they are least bothered abt customer needs …even after 1 hour no one bothered to update why it was delayed ……will never go to swiggy"
"I have used this app lots but never again. Twice now I ordered baked goods from Theobroma and Suchalis, on both occasions the delivery has arrived missing items, significant amounts of items and Swiggy have refused to refund me for the deficit. This is theft!!! I am very motivated to warn as many people as possible away from using this appalling app, especially where there are so many better alternatives. We are now Zomato people. I suggest you join us and ditch these goons! Your pockets will thank me."
If they don't have staff then y they took order i order @ near 920 when i was not getting on time i called restaurant they said order was ready before 20 min back but no person came.from swiggy why they spoiled food and when i said for cancellation they ask for charges swiggy ask for charges
"I have a horrible experience with Swiggy. As I ordered food today, I get smelly food. After that when I create a ticket, 3 person get in touch with me for resolution (Anweshta, Rakesh and Farah). After too long talk and chat Farah asked me to take out the spoiled food from the dustbin to take pictures, so that they intiate replacement or refund. What a great support faculty by Swiggy."
How could they pack together eggs and chicken and puja flowers in one bag ??? without any wrapping... how can they pack cold drinks and cockroach sprays together. Butter veggies everything in one bag . No special packaging for chicken Butter for specially frozen things everything did into the one bag which spoil other things also like vegetables fruits and other accessories.. are they do favours for sending us the products are and we paying them the service charges and the money of the products. Day by the day thier services is becoming pathetic... last 2 years i am consistently giving them feedback to customer executive but they thing that reimbursement to the product cost is the solution rather improvising service.Swiggy instamart is not taking customers concerns seriously. I am trying to ask n number of questions about our concern which is really humiliating people will stop giving orders to swiggy instamart rather wasting time on customer care... The simply do nothing just irritates customer so they will fed up.
I regularly use the app for ordering both the groceries and also food.  The service and customer support received is really good.  It will be really nice if they bring down the minimum order value for the free delivery and also bring down one membership fee.  The vegetable prices especially for the organic vegetables are really on the higher side and this issue needs to be addressed soon.  User interface is good and smooth. The app rarely hangs but is a bit slow on my mobile.  I would like to recommend this app for regular use easily.
"Hi Swiggy/ Eat Fit, Its said that feeding someone is the best karma in the world however when you are charging for it than its purely becomes business & if your order gets delivered on time than you get great sense of satisfaction however when you don't get your order on time or never get it then you feel cheated. The has happened with me & I believe many of us felt the same at some point in time. My Order no #165348767838 never got delivered from Eat Fit as you can see that in the screenshot, considering it was late evening order I kept Rs 50 for the delivery boy. Seems the Eat Fit Guys doesn't want me fit. I tried my best to connect to swiggy & solved the puzzle of IVR chat solution for 20 mins & got hold of a swiggy rep. who was unable to provide me a solution so I asked for a supervisor who never came on call for more then 1 HOUR. Looks like you guys have no value for customers time. Swiggy & Eat Fit wants me to Hungary today & I am perfectly fine with it & in return I want Swiggy & Eat Fit to Feed 10, 000 Families who really need it the most for 1 whole day. I am a Swiggy customer & I request all other swiggy customers who has also been left over hungry by swiggy not to use the app on 30th Apr & 7 May. LET SWIGGY AND OTHER COMMPITETOR KNOW THE VALUE AND POWER OF CUSTOMER."
"Unprofessional behaviour of delivery person, the package was open and when we complaint about it he said we have opened it"
"There was a time when swiggy was great. Today that's not the case. Ordered breakfast from the same place i do every week. I had guests over who had an early train journey and i had promised them great breakfast. That turned into a nightmare. They took the order and delivery guy on app showed standing in one place for 20 mins. Untill i didn't start fighting with their ""customer service"" on their ""help chat"" did any movement from the delivery guy show at all. Next calling delivery guy he claimed traffic issues at 8:30 am in the morning on a road which empty at that time. Wow. I asked for a refund for told i will be charged a cancellation fee. Means I'm out of luck. After arguing and threatening them that i will leave bad reviews for them on different platforms that's when they offered me a stingy 61 ruppees voucher. Told them I don't need their 61 ruppees charity and decided to post this review wherever i can because clearly Swiggy values it's customers and providing satisfaction at a mere 61 ruppees. Thanks but no thanks. Keep the 61 bucks clearly swiggy needs it more than i do."
"SWIGGY CHEATED ME! I placed an order from swiggy . After some time I got a call from the no -+91226956XXXX saying "" we are from swiggy team and your order will be delayed a lot"" then I asked the lady to cancel my order and refund my entire amount and she assured that it will be done within 2 hrs. But I got a message saying - "" you will be charged the entire amount"" when I raised a concern with swiggy support team, they said - ""we have not got any order delay update""."
BUYERS BE AWARE..The company sells things beyond the consumption date without sharing with the customer. Recently bought a sausage packet which had manufacturing date as early as August 2022. Please watch before you buy as they have blocked review system of the app.
I order food for my family.They delivered burnt rotis which were so bitter in taste. When I complained and uploaded the pics they offered me refund of 12 rs while my 2 orders were worth 280 rs. Seems like they were doing me a favour with the refund of 12 rs. There was no option to speak to any support guy. In app only chat bot speaks. I raised on FB they asked to drop an email and I have been offered 28 rs refund wihout any action or corrective measure. I think we should stop ordering from online app and support our local small vendors who are not on these app which charge hefy amounts in the name of delivery fees and deliver junk.
Plus points...fast service.  Minus points ..zero help in case of bad quality items. Insists on images . Very limited options. End result. Sorry
Each I place the order from Swiggy these Swiggy people miss something or the other in my order and they denies to refund the money never order things from Swiggy Instamart worst services. I had ordered dal makhani and in place they had sent lasun dal which was cheapee and tasted like vomit...... And some of the items were missing when I complained they denied to refund again worst services ever their food tastes like vomit and they cheat customers worst services ever
I have placed an order but i have missed products deliver but customer support asking 6 hrs to do investigation then they will give solution worst response from them still it was not solved.  Mistake is done from their end why should I wait
"Bad quality Fruits And Vegetables Delivered,  Bad Quality Fruits And Vegetables Delivered  And Service Support Is Also Bad"
"Seriously swiggy is going to dogs. I often order grocery and other items, and many times things are either poor quality or given old batch products with dust and looks dirty. When I complained recently of a moisturizer which was 11/21 batch, asked them to replace with a new batch or atleast 2022 batch. But they completely denied. It's a force buy, forcing to keep a 1 year 5 months old product. Bmvery bad. The other day I ordered 1kg bananas, and they sent overly ripped bananas which was smelling. And many such incidents. Vry bad. Very disappointed"
@swiggy.com.  M here to share the bad experience about swiggy's cancellation policy. M aware we are given 60 secs to cancel but couldn't do it due to technical glitch & had cancelled my order through chat maybe in next 60 secs but these CC denied to refund or revoke the cancellation conveying that the amount is already paid to the restaurant & when I cross checked with the restaurant I got know the process of payment. Payment to every restaurant is made once in a week or once in fortnight but these people gives us the wrong info to loot us with every cancellation.  So please be aware & do question to refund. And it's unfair to have a cancellation time limit for 60 secs.. which we may fail to do it as the the home page takes time to display post payment process.
"I had placed an order of 312Rs, and they have missed to deliver 1 item worth 100Rs, upon talking to the customer service the team is only compensating me 22Rs which does not even cover the cost of the reported missing item. I spoke to Mr Taha and Mr Biplab both are saying 22rs is the best they can do despite me telling them that the missing item is of 100Rs."
I got a very good experience with this app and always get my order on time ?? . Very user friendly app and the delivery guys are also very good. But there is one problem the texes u including are a little high then regular and also higher then Zomato.
I ordered my food...Was waiting for the delivery boy after making pizza.Went to delivery boy after 40 mins...And didn't even bring it to me. He was making excuses. Later he asked me to cancel the order upfront. What rubbish it wasHere we sit on the trust of swiggy and the delivery boy refuses to bring the delivery and himself says cancel the order... Mohan and Shivraj both were arguing with me.. literallyI was very upset
"I have ordered from swiggy and after the order had been picked up and waiting for 30 mins , I got a call from swiggy platform saying the order is not available and can't be delivered so they asked me to cancel it , this happened to me twice after making me wait for my order for 40 mins , I had guests waiting at my office and what I receive is a call saying it's not available so I have to cancel my order and why it is not chargeable if swiggy asks us to cancel our order? Of we won't cancel the order within 60 seconds we won't get a refund.then why isn't swiggy paying it's customer the loss of waiting ?"
Please dont order from swiggy.They donat value customer. I wait for my order more than 1.30hr. And finally they force to cancle it. Worst worst worst
"Greetings of the day  I was a user of swiggy since years but today swiggy did the worst thing. They have charged me without delivery of food. Their PDM could not recieve the call and they cancel the order from their end under the pretext of not recieving the phone.  Great job swiggy , today I uninstalled swiggy forever and also shared my case with my friends and they also uninstalled the app. Worst service. Money doesn't matter much but you all are just fake committer of good service. Zomato is far far better than this. Hate it ."
"Frequent delays, spills, poor response.. zomato is way better..do not recommended"
"When I looked at the meals description before ordering the food, I saw that fishfry boiledegg was included, but when the food arrived, these 2 items were not included  So I went to the complaint chat box and complained but you gave me a coupon of 17 rupees and closed my complaint.Others provide better service than you. I will never suggest you to anyone unless you fix this"
"I recently had a terrible experience with Swiggy. I placed an order and was unable to pick it up due to some issues, and since it was a prepaid order, I had to cancel it. To my horror, Swiggy charged me the full amount of the order as a cancellation fee, even though I had no way to pick up the order. This is a complete scam, and I would encourage everyone to stay away from Swiggy. Their customer service is non-existent, and they have no respect for customer rights. Stay away from this fraud company."
"WORST APP I EVER SAW, DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS, THEY WILL NEVER VGIVE YOU FOOD BUT ALSO NEVER GIVE UR MONEY BACK, AND THEIR CANCELATION CHARGES ARE EVEN MORE THAN UR FOOD AMOUNT.  DO NOT USE THIS APP AGAIN AND M GOIN G TO UNINSTALL THIS APP, VERY PATHETIC SERVICE."
You guys exploited a patient when she was down with Covid. Asking to send picture of a product ordered on Instamart when she is running down with fever and this inhumane response. Swiggy notfastdelivery. Selling damaged and non working medical kits like oximeter in Covid.  Humanity just died. Sheer money exploitation.
Bad service with a horrible experience. Items r missing and this is not the first it's happend repating they r doing the same and when I try to raise this thing there is a only one line from the customer support am sorry and can't arrange anything. There r 2 option refund r replacement. See not they r not giving the right yo give them the perfect rating.
The swiggy is the worst delivery app. They never deliver the food on time nor acknowledge. It happened third time. Never order food as you will keep waiting.
Swiggy company want people money they don't do good service very bad management service very badpolicy it's not worth even 1 star
Don't order food from this app ...ghatiya hai ye log aur inke delivery partner....phone to lagta nahi Inka... customer care wale hi inhe contact nahi kar pate...sorry ki pipudi bajaenge hamare aage...i order a food minight 12:45am waiting for it till 1:45am...and order cancel karna pada bcs delivery boy ka call hi nahi lag raha tha .. DON'T use this pathetic app...Zomato is far better than this app
"I ordered food for my guests and children at home from Swiggy, the order was delayed for 2 hours. All the people were starving at home but still the swiggy team could not reply to us. Once the food arrived home it was all soggy and very bad, no one could eat it and we had to throw it out. After that I talked to customer service representatives. They were so annoying that they couldn't understand my problem and still they don't accept their mistake.  I never thought the customer service people of this HUGE company ""SWIGGY"" could be so rough and heartless.  If this continues I feel swiggy should stop working as there's no point in disappointing their valuable customer.  From now on I'll order food from one of their best competitors as they have heart and they understand the problem."
We can order Doodh Burfi from (Bansal's Sweet) and they delivered DODA After wrong product delivered no body entertain you.They are giving me helpline number(08067466734) which is not valid . On app there is a chat option for help but it's still not working. Even you can't upload pictures for wrong product.
Very very very very bad bad experience with this delivery boy ...very very rude... Unprofessional ... He just behaviour is just like customer are nothing.. shame on you swiggy having such bad PPL your team...stop this nonsense PPL in your team... Also showing off his money that leaving 5 to 10 Rs/- on customer and having very big heart. Really unprofessional behaviour which is not acceptable at all...never recommended swiggy to have food from you... Really bad bad and bad experience. If you are a delivery shud be responsible persons to have at least 10 to 20 Rs/- change with them.
"Shameful behaviour by Swiggy deliver boy who came for delivery. He called me from a distance of 400 meters to collect. I said you come to location, he said ""Gaadi aapka matha p rakhenge "".  Hell with service! Dignity of Senior citizen is more important. I went down and collected as it was very important. He said complain to swiggy. I know swigfy will not do anything but Police FIR will definitely help . We don't trust swiggy will take action . WB 8E 3417"
It was tastelessaapam. It was cold and hard . It had little taste of plain dosa. One of the worst appam i have tasted so far
Very bad swiggy customer not satisfied and delivery partner not satisfied due to company customer waiting order and company provide third party order then deley order
"No update from my complaint, quantity issue food, if you are charging high then quantity need to be provided in good portion"
"I have faced this issue with Swiggy Ginie especially if it comes to get things delivered from places which are beyond 5-10kms. I had to get medicines delivered as it was an emergency and swiggy delivery partners reach the place and they just dont pick up the calls for more than 5-10mns, I get notifications that the delivery partner is trying to call me. When I call they dont pick up the calls and then cancel the order and all Swiggy can say is we are sorry about it. Why do Swiggy operate Ginie if they cant get things delivered if its from a far away place? If you are looking to get something delivered especially Medicine from far away places then please opt for Wefast. their charge is half of what Swiggy charges."
"Faltu service, faltu app bass lotne aaye hai yeh sab . Full on attitude meh rehte hai thik se bartav nhi hai inka."
Worst app ever.. customer support very poor...money was totally waste...paise lootne k liye baithe h bas
"I’ve ordered food around 9:50 and waited till 11:30  Almost 2 hours and my order got cancelled.  Around 10:30 it showed like  On time delivery , will reach in 4 mins  And I was expecting as my 2 years old were starving.  I talked to 5 customer care executives just to make sure my order gets delivered because by the time every restaurant in my locality is closed.  If only I didn’t chose Swiggy and trust them.  My daughter and I slept on empty stomach.  As I was spending just one night at my flat I didn’t had anything to cook or have.  Bad service and they asked me to wait 10 minutes after every other 10 mins and finally it got cancelled.  And all they say is “we understand and sorry for the inconvenience caused”  “We’ll issue a coupon as complimentary”  I said I don’t want your coupon  I can’t feed coupon to my baby and put her to sleep.  I deleted the app and will never gonna use it.  And so the coupon.  Delivery executive already reported issues from their side as soon as they assigned him.  But Swiggy failed to assign new delivery partner.  And the customer care put my call on hold each time just to tell me that “we can’t reach the delivery partner”.  I asked them to contact with restaurant before 11  As it closes by 11:00.  And I even told them I’ll go collect it by myself.  They said order has been picked up by delivery partner.  I told them don’t believe Whats showing on your screen as I believed “delivery in 4 mins” for 1 hour.  I literally commanded to contact the restaurant and all they say is order is picked up.  They even lied about contacting restaurant.  They never did.  Worst experience and I lost my time and energy."
I was an employee of Swiggy I join in the year 2019 and kick me out of swiggy without prior notice during covid 20. I was newly married and just started our journey on March 20. By that time due to covid pressure the stupid startup lost their money here and there. This is the situation as of now till today. Requesting you all not to join any startups.
Worst service. Worst customer handling. Worst in attitude. Worst management. Everything is worst worst. Waste company
"Yesterday I ordered subway from swiggy around 9 PM. Initially it was told that order would be delivered in 41 minutes. Later when i contacted customer service chat they said 51 minutes. After waiting for around 1 hour , I called delivery executive, he said by mistake he has gone to wrong address. He told that he will come to deliver soon. After few minutes swiggy website shown order delivered. I asked customer support how can you show order delivered when it is not. They said we can refund your amount. Imagine a person waiting for food at the end of the day and a company who promises to deliver food acts in such a way. Pls avoid swiggy whenever you can. It is a fraud company."
I tried to change my delivery address on their app a minute after ordering. It took 5 mins for the person on chat to respond who then calls and rudely tells me the address can’t be changed. His name was Diptajoy. I asked for an escalation and didn’t happen either. This has happed several times with this company. That have absolutely no sense of service and no escalation process. Pathetic company. Unfortunately this review will make absolutely no difference to their horrible attitude and useless service.
"I placed the order for the first time and waited for more than 2 hours then got it for no reason canceled. I kept on following up with the customer care chat because I was unable to reach out to the delivery person's phone and the CS also keep on saying the same thing and said the order is picked up and will be delivered in 15 mins. Finally, they canceled the order after 2 hours of waiting at 9.50 pm and apologized for the inconvenience. I have placed this order from the USA for my parents who live in Hyderabad. Please don't trust swingy services"
"Ordered for 1000 and received food for 400 and would not refund the remaining, one of the worst experience, 1 is the bare minimum, if there's anything below it is would have rated"
"Today I ordered food with swiggy the delivery guy had picked the food, he was supposed to deliver within 30 mins, but even after one hour he didn’t turn up. Later I got a call from call Center saying your order has been cancelled as the delivery person has picked the food, but unable to come to your location. And my location is a prime location in Bangalore. I had guest waiting for food and I had no words to answer them. It was already late. This was a big insult to me and my guests. They should have told me prior. There refunds cannot substitute this.  Very very bad experience. And the way the call center informed was like. Your order is cancelled and we will refund the amount. They don’t understand all this."
"Dear,  I have uninstalled your swiggy app which I have been using from many years because you have fired your delivery executive Sachin Panchal for not delivering non vegetarian food inside a temple in Delhi. This is ridiculous behaviour which hurts religious sentiments of hindus. I have decided never to use your swiggy app to order food unless you re-instate Sachin Panchal back to work."
The worse service they provide to customer. Their delivery boys don't know the address and blackmail customer cancel the order and also ask you for cancellation charges.  I will never use swiggy in future.  ????
"I have ordered food on Holi festival at 11.25am as few guest came to join us on lunch. They are showing delivery after 32 mins but unfortunately swiggy delivery partner and restaurant partner both were not responding. We finally cancel ordered at 01:20pm. Surprisingly, swiggy customer support was not responding and even haven't a single of sorry for this delay and spoiled our festival.  This kind of attitude they have for customer."
Boycott swiggy. u can not rùn buisness and agenda together. No order here after from swiggy. Happy holi
Why your company gave your opinion on our festival even that you promote non vegetarian egg for your promotion and boycott our festival..same on you..see what kind of thinking you have..
"Cheater and fraudsters are working in this company. Shameful employees as well as very rude, I will file the case in court and stop this type of bullshit company ASAP."
"Swiggy a bunch of cheaters and thiefs.placed an order frm chembur restaurant .the dish was charged on swiggy was for 340 rsfound the quantity very less  .immediatly ordered it directly from the same hotel, the same dish was of rs 230 and a better quantity.  Plus thy charge us delivery and govt charges.real theifs.ths was my last order on swiggy"
"I had placed an order of bill amount 2800 and the items of amount 900 were missing from the delivery. When I complained to them, they did nothing except for sending apologies. They cannot provide a proper item wise bill and neither were the able to provide details of how many packages were sent to my house."
Worst Behaviour in subash nagar By Manish...  My Vehicle is Cycle they default add my vechile Bike and tell me Don't change ur vechile .... on Cycle i have got 8km above order distance...  I am not using Bike and also don't Know How to drive Bike with No License..  They tell me Dont work with swiggy...  Worst Behaviour
"Worst experience.. the delivery agent could not deliver the order as my number was not reachable, however I had provided an alternate number. The delivery agent canceled the order where as my family was waiting for the food. And I received a message saying that my money will not be refunded and they charged me the entire amount as cancelation charges. Completely unethical and unacceptable attitude"
How many times I asked you and your organization about delivery was not delivered to me. Kindly cordinate with chat box excutive sujata and also check my location and your delivery boy location on delivery status update time. She is ready that time as give me 425 rupees voucher but I not agree and he transfer my chat to her senior but he or she not responding me.  I don't understand that first delivery was not delivered by Aman Kumar because his location stuck on that time and he also not pick the call. But again 2nd order picked by Aman Kumar on same time how it is possible just think....  This is show very very worst service and customer support
I ordered a Thai chicken dimsum online. It was tasting rotten. It was old food. Swiggy neither replaced with a fresh order nor did refund. couldn't eat rotten food. My money in vain.. customer support very unhelpful. Didn't make any solution to this issue.
"You will not get order, delivery guy will fool you saying order is deliver and they customer care also fool you taking more than 1.5 hrs to deliver your replacement order which should be deliver in 15 min"
"Swiggy is totally fraud, they deliver food more than accepted time and confess there mistake but still dont refund customer money as i ordered south indian food and they deliver it in 1.5 hours and after complaining they accepted there mistake but not refunded my money and i have to put all the cold and stale food in dustbin, this happen with me 1 day back.... Its totally fraud company , uninstall its app and use zomato as they r far b"

"Swiggy is fraud , Maine delivery ke Liye order Kia Tha Swiggy genie per delivery partner ne mana Kar Diya Aur Swiggy Ne Khud hi cancel Kia order Uske bad refund bhi nhi diya Swiggy is fraud Swiggy is fraud Swiggy is fraud"
Food had petrol smell as it was placed below two wheeler driver seat above petrol tank. due to this I had vomiting and loose motions.  Company has millions of customers but cannot afford a food box for food delivery.
Old and damaged products delivered. They just making customer place as dumbing yard for expired and Damaged vegitable
"I ordered my food yesterday. The delivery partner did not even deliver my food. and In the app It sharted showing "" Order Delivered"" Delivery partner's name is Amir Khan. I called the Swiggy team. The team even took me in conference with thedelivery partner where he clearly stated that he did not hand over the food to me. I dropped a mail too. It's almost 24 hrs. Did not get any revert from the team. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER"
I put dhanori address swiggy gps selected koregaon park address and they cancelled my order and didn't refund anything
"Swiggy really needs to do better, horrible customer service, they’ve started lying now regarding updates and statuses, very disappointing."
T’s been 60 min now and they have still not assigned a delivery partner. When I called up the restaurant they confirmed the order has been picked up. There is no response from the Swiggy customer care. And they are not letting me cancel my order either. Pathetic service.
"Bad service provide swiggy , not proper timing in delever, bad costumer support and cancel order, no proper live location locate, my order is cancel and i am waiting for 50 min, reallly bad service provide"
"Ordered dry snacks online, fortunately or unfortunately one item was not available and the vendor called to ask if the same can be replaced, since I wanted to see what else is available I checked their online site and found that the rates quoted there are much cheaper than that quoted on SWIGGY APP. Had ordered 8 items and each was priced Rs.20/- more than the actual price. I took the matter up with SWIGGY but besides apologies they were not ready to refund the extra amount.feel CHEATED BY SWIGGY"
"Really the services are getting worst by swiggy day by day.  Closing complaints even without providing any resolution or agent support.  Even you are a swiggy one subscriber, the instamart order will be delivered after the estimated time no value of having One subscription.  Everytime if you have any issue the system will reply with a auto generated Message like need more time investigate.  And still then their reply will be irrelevant like rating restaurants either if swiggy is responsible for the delivery issues."
"My swiggy account got hacked and fraudster started placing orders using my account. I informed swiggy support immediately but swiggy support is so stupid they waited for 2 days to stop all orders.Fraudster even used my card to place order, however failed bcos it needs otp thankfully. when I asked how my account was hacked swiggy gave stupid excuses. first they said there was SECURITY issue in the app, then now they have blocked my account so that I cant even delete my card from swiggy account! this is pathetic! customer support dont even speak proper english, just copy paste response irrespective of your questions! swiggy has served its purpose, its time to ban this company! when you place order on swiggy, packaging charges, delivery charges etc, but food not delivered on time and package is damaged. what swiggy gives as excuse is pathetic! I would not use swiggy as no personal info is safe if my account can be hacked as easily then anyone else can be! did swiggy inform customers about this security flaw not sure they did, they want money at cost of customers! shame on such a company. No more swiggy"
"Ordered groceries with extra charges for fast delivery and after 2 hrs of chatting got the refund and not groceries.Customer care executive was not able to write the reason for delay.  It's seriously funny that swiggy don't have the centralized customer care , u can't call and explain ur problem, it's upto there wish when to connect with you and delivery agent and when not?"
It is one of the worst services I have ever come across. I think they should seriously shut down instead of causing inconvenience to people. Orders are updated due to non availability and then they are updated again as updated orders are also unavailable. Never ever will I order through this useless provider. It is not a service provider but should be name inconvenience provider.
"Bad Service, Not delivery on time.  Not expected. It's the second time it's happening ordered food from sandwich but never ever delivered. And Delivery person doing timepass at JM road Pune. He is not bother even about order. Really pathetic. Don't order. Deliveries sucks. Disapponted"
"Not oder from swiggy. I oder my food not received 2 hr they totally confused the customer, it's resturant mistake."
"Very bad service .  Delivery person marked as my order delivered . But then customer escalation team, asking me to send a mail rather than resolving. my issue .  me & my family was slept hungy that day."
Very bad experience with Swiggy today. Food packet was broker and delivery agent told that only the packet is broken and all items are there. But 2 items were also missing. Very bad service and I will stop using Swiggy.
"Last twp orders have to be cancelled , poor customer support. Delivery people dnt even have ID cards"
Swiggy will not allow to change the address to be delivered. For cancellation must happen with in a minute. To search the cancellation app it's self take three minutes. So they are nicely cheeting usto grabe the whole amount.
Yesterday I have ordered food at 8:35pm. But i did not get my food yet. Also i was trying to call and msz on help line. But no one contact me. Also they did no return my money back. When again I called customer care after one day. They returned my money back. Guys do not believe on swiggy. They all r cheaters.
"Very bad service from swiggy these days. My last 3 orders were with only issues. Missing items, delayed delivery, no proper support, they keep you on long holds when you chat with them for any support in addition trying to charge cancellation charge when order doesn't not get delivered.  Don't recommend this site anymore"
I have ordered an item and the item is not delivered but marked as delivered. For which swiggy is not ready to refund money either deliver the item. They are upfront saying we don't refund or we dont deliver. Don't ever order food in swiggy.
For Rs 40 for 2 samosa charged Rs 124. That includes tips and delivery charge. Product is okay. It was slightly warmer. Expect to be very warm
1st time I have order food on swiggy. very bad experience which i never had before delivery boy was very rude he did not came to proper location which I mentioned while ordering. After connecting customer care he came and he asked for extra charges that was very bad .bad service....
"There is nothing positive to say about. After 40 minutes, assigned a delivery partner. In the night they eat your order and sometimes dont agree for the same. Just boycot them and let this company know you will not make us fool out of your flop service. Food packing is also opened sometimes."
It's Pathetic. I have ordered an item and the item is not delivered. For which swiggy is not ready to refund money either deliver the item. They are upfront saying we don't refund or we dont deliver. Don't ever order food in swiggy. Even if you forced to order prefer cash on delivery. Check the items before paying.
"Cheap food quality & delayed delivery are two major characteristics of Swiggy. Moreover, the customer service is bad. Go for Zomato! Zero star!"
SWIGGY IS NOW NOT ACCEPTING NET BANKING - CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS.  FORCING USERS TO USE UPI PAYMENT METHOD.  WHY? WHY?  WHOSE INTEREST SWIGGY IS NOW SUPPORTING?  NOT USERS FOR SURE.
Delivery takes too long avoid ordering on swiggy  They r not capable of delivering on time.  Avoid ordering on swiggy
Ordered books from a shop. The guy says he could not reach me and took them to his residence. He asks for additional money to bring it from his home. That cost is more than book cost. Genie folks say sorry but that's the only solution
I ordered special thail. I got not same meal its totally different. Then I complaint order for coustomer care to resolve but they can't. And not resloved fake fake fake ... Bakwas company They not resloved any problem.
Ordered pizza and got full burn pizza and when shared pics with swiggy they said rate the restaurant as we can help you even I am one plus member.  Then I have order again from some other restaurants as previous restaurant number was fraud this services provide by swiggy to premium members and take good commissions on it.
"I am facing lot of issues with swiggy delivery partners, they are not delivering food on time.Please assign proper delivery partners"
"I have ordered food for an amount of Rs. 1200, delivery boy Ani PM couldn't find my location and instructed me to cancel my order I lost my food and an amount of 1200. Never ever no one should try with swiggy. very bad"
"The worst is today at 3 am..,  I'm very sick so I ordered then with in 1 mints when I complained they told me they can't fix any problem."
Earlier swiggy served well but now it is taking customers with paid subscription as high fraud and have changed technical scenario that while customers try to order form reputed restaurants during peek hours of service they mark all delivery executives busy in area making order unserviceable or give you high service hours. If you select high service hours they do not assign delivery partner till service centre is contacted under I want to cancel my order or their bot goes on fooling you under where is my order.  Later they give empathy statements and do not take ownership or pay any refund or fine.  Swiggy will loose the market very soon.  If you contact service centre they mark customer high fraud without understanding authenticity of the complaint.  Swiggy has turned to be a big fraud selling food not service and making various tax frauds as well.  Do see the taxes before applying discount and after discount that increases after discount without explanation in inventory.  Bhanu  9217121551
"Not 1ce or 2ce , everytime faced this problem, their delivery partner cannot read, don't understand Google Map, and the customer care tries to coverup. This time just cancelled my order without permission.Many a times show delivered without even delivering the food."
The worst delivery service ever. Swiggy have some how managed to slow their clock. Even though it's late but on the app it will always show that it's ontime. This is how they dupe customers.
My order didn't got delivered in 50 mins  (It was supposed to come within 25mins)  & Without any information they cancelled my order and initiated refund after 50 mins. They didn't even bother to call.  And when I asked for reason they offered me ₹100 coupon as that can make for everything..  My kids were waiting for that order and they got upset..  I have seen these issues before but now decided to uninstall it.
"Customer support is so pathetic that they close the ticket without any update. When you call them, they will talk as if they are going to resolve the issue now itself but in reality they are worst."
"Even after 2 hours of waiting, not food got delivered. and no body picked up the calls. Worst food delivery system"
Be careful while ordering multiple items. If some items are missing they will not refund you the money and their support will talk to you as you are wasting their time. plus they will keep you on the app for an hour or so just to send you standard messages. They will respond to concern raised with gap of 3-4 days. Every email communication will be replied after 3-4 days. They will never refund the money. They are working hands in glove with associated resturants. Never ever order through them
"I placed an order at 1.52pm, I was told it would reach by 51 mins even at 3.14 the pickup person had not reached whereas my food was ready and getting cold. Even customer service did nothing to help and expected me to take the cold food. Instead of giving options to atleast get fresh food made. I am really disappointed, also there is an option for payment of rupay credit cards which never works and cash payment has been disabled."
I had ordered a medical equipment and it was medical emergency and the time is constantly growing when i asked to customer support they replied we dont have the delivery partner in ur area swiggy has to tell me one thing if they do not fullfill requirement then close this service atleast customer will not wait for ur resolution
"I used to use Swiggy quite often when I was at work-from-office(WFO). With work-from-home(WFH) in place and Swiggy imposing delivery charges for food ordered within a 4 km distance my interest in using Swiggy for ordering food has drastically gone down.  I don't agree with people blaming Swiggy always or deliberately delivering food late to the customer. Yes, they do deliver food late sometime. I do travel around the city(Hyderabad, Telangana) on my 2-wheeler, and the truth is that the roads are heavily congested nowadays and have a lot of traffic. People need to understand the population of the country(including the cities) is increasing and with that, the crowd and traffic are also increasing. Surprisingly we people who sit in our lavish homes or offices don't understand the problem faced by a delivery boy/man who goes from place to place to collect food or goods and deliver them to the customer.  Sorry to say food quality is not Swiggy's responsible. It's the responsibility of the restaurant and the buyer. I have seen many of my colleagues and friends who will be blaming Swiggy for food quality but while ordering they will look for the food that comes with the highest discount on the price. When a discount is high either quality has to go down or quantity will be less.  It's common sense, just think you wanna prepare a dish back at home and you restrict the ingredients you use to keep the expense low. Example: Payasam/Kheer with Raisins, Cashewnut, and other dry fruits will certainly be tastier that a Payasam/Kheer that doesn't have these ingredients. Certainly, either one will need to prepare it in less quantity or it won't be that tasty. Again one can't expect home food from restaurants or hotels.  If one feels the food is not good they should give a bad review for the same on Swiggy's app, which will allow the next buyer to rethink before ordering food/a particular dish from that restaurant. And also visit Google and give an in-detailed negative review for the same on Google Review for that restaurant.  Coming to Swiggy having bad delivery partners, every company has good and bad employees.  The problem with most Indians is that they want services that they don't understand nor do they have time to read the Terms and Conditions and understand the same before availing of the services.  The Terms & Conditions of Swiggy on their official website reads as follows(Screenshot attached for reader's reference):  The Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Swiggy shall not be responsible for:  The services or goods provided by the Merchants including but not limited to serving of food Orders suiting your requirements and taste;  The Merchant's services or goods, or services provided by PDPs not being up to Buyer expectations or leading to any loss, harm or damage to him/her;  The availability or unavailability of certain items on the menu;  The Merchant serving the incorrect Orders; or  Product liability of goods provided by Merchants.  As long as an individual is fine to bear the delivery charges that Swiggy is imposing on its customers, I recommend that one should always order food from Swiggy as the delivery boy/men have family and they need to feed them back at home as this is their source of income.  UNDERSTAND SWIGGY IS A DELIVERY SERVICE & THE DELIVERY BOYS/MEN ARE HUMAN BEINGS. If you understand this concept and have time to read and understand the Terms & Conditions of Swiggy only then you are eligible to use the services of Swiggy."
"Never order food from Swiggy app..They are the worst food delivery app.When you are facing any issues with the food quality or the delay, there will be an option to escalate it.They will simply ask you to rate the restaurant.I ordered vegetarian food but received non veg but still no support received at all.I had throw and the money got wasted and due to the delay it was past the dinner time so had to sleep empty stomach.."
They stealbyour hard earned money.deliberately delay the order and then charge you cancellation if you are not responsive.  They think it is ok for them to delay but we should not delay response to the delivery executive.  Pathetic food most of the time stale.
"Review on swiggy is manipulated, they supply unhygienic food and rotten food to customers.  Even they do not allow to write review on their flatform after delivery of food."
Once my wife ordered dinner from swiggy but the delevery guy Ganesh das was so rude that he was asking for extra money to deliver the item to the delivery address and later on threatened her for her next delivery  Zomato are better then swiggy they even can't track the delivery address as to Zomato the reach the correct
"Recently, I ordered food from through Swiggy. My son wanted Mutton Chops. I searched through Swiggy and nailed down on Maasa - The golden coast. I ordered along with other items as well. The restaurant took about 10 odd minutes before accepting the order. Post almost an hour Swiggy calls me to say that Mutton chops is not there. The lady from Swiggy was encouraging me to cancel the full order without any sensitivity to the fact that I waited for an hour and we were waiting for lunch. She didn’t want to penalize the restaurant or whosoever was responsible for this mess. The handling by Swiggy left much to be desired in terms of customer centricity. Pathetic client satisfaction."
I keep ordering food everyday from swiggy. Last 4 to 5 orders have been horrible. The latest one got delivered with incomplete items. I contact customer care yogesh amd he said he cant do anything in this regards. Why cant their delivery agent check the order before blindly picking. Instead they charged me cancellation fee. I have made sure this is my last order with them and i am not going to renew swiggy one. Zero customer support and rude
"I ordered a family pack briyani worth 250 rupees along with other items . The delivery person forgot the family briyani , when I called customer service they offered me a refund of 100 rs. I told them that the item that was not delivered was more value. They asked me to send an email about this . After I sent an email, the response I got they have no proof despite sending them pictures. They closed the case and no refund was ever given. HORRIBLE!"
I have ordered a meal expecting to be delivered within 40min and they took more than 1hr 30min and when connected with customer care they are rude as anything.They don't listen to you or put you on hold Pathetic customer care service.Dont order from this app.They are fraud.They don't value customer
Swiggy has themselves cancelled the order in the last minute whereas cancellation is not allowed in the app and claim that user has cancelled and swindled the money . Order only by COD very fraudulent tactics being employed by then to swindle easy money
"In my order for Pulse snack somehow Pulse oxymeter has got added on the instamart order.It is blatant ripoff as when I checked this item was not there. Probably it might have got added because it showed unwarranted in the list.NOW supposing if an item got added Inadvetently and you paid for it when you shop in person, won't you have the option to return it? The shopkeeper may not return money but you can exchange another item for full value. In Siggy instamart we are unable to reach anyone. It has taken my hard earned 1300 rupee. It is a faceless inhuman demon that rips u off for using and paying on the app. Beware No one to help you out at all. In a nation 1.30 billion can you not have few people to attend customer calls?"
"Hello Iam upset with Swiggy today. I ordered some food and I could see the delivery guy almost reaching my place and when I went out, I could not track order on the app. And I went to chat to complain and the chat gives me the delivery guy number, so i call up the number and the guy tells me, sir Iam getting many calls asking for Swiggy services but I don’t work for Swiggy. Now again I went back to chat and complained them, and they apologized and returned my money to my bank account. But my hunger I have no words to say. Very bad customer support you guys are not fit in delivering food. Zomato is far far better."
I ordered from swiggy with 100 rupees swiggy voucher which the delivery partner never delivered rather he updated delivered and when I complained on swiggy customer care then they gave me 100 rs coupon joki free me milta h mera 100rs gaya kabhi mat karna zomato is far better
"I have swiggy app from long time I Never used it but unfortunately I used to on 19dec 2022, some guest in my house I thouth let order some Gajjar ka halwa swiggy show 25 minutes, I place order at 10.05pm , that really swiggy call center took delivery person online from 10:50 to 11:15 both were on call but no body reached at place , at same time same order my guest place with other app from same shpe they research at home.

Thank"
Osm bro brother I ordee on cake house chatarpur locality they r deliverd nice cake on time and also give to me agritng msg to my wiffy birthday so very thankful bro
They take a long time for delivering food than the expected time they show.  Their Help and support system is poor.  You should try different app for food delivery.
Swiggy cheats you by taking your money and then the delivery partners don't deliver the food. This has been happening multiple times .  Hence I am posting to aware people NOT to take service from this extremely unprofessional and cheater company Swiggy.
"Swiggy claim ""delivery from restaurant to home within 10kms free"" is NOT TRUE, they charged double the cost fr 1km distance."
Bad service and payment deduction ke bad bhot ghumate hai payment refund nhi krte Puri team 1week tak customer ko jhooth bolte h 24 hrs mai jaygi or ghumate h refund nhi krte ye kuch
My order not delivered but aap show status delivered. denied for any refund. neither delivery nor refund.
Swiggy is not bothered about customer care. There was missing of items and interchange of items with less value. When connected with customer care they are able to take only one complaint against an order and interchanged was not refunded. Very bad in delivery and refund policy.
"I ordered 3 packs of VEG PULAO for Rs 420 on SWIGGY on OCTOBER 20, 2022. When I unpacked everything and sat down to eat the pulao, the pulao was stale and unpleasant in smell. I raised a complaint on SWIGGY. SWIGGY gave me a refund of ONLY Rs 15, whereas 3 packs of VEG PULAO cost me Rs 420!  Despite several emails, SWIGGY kept saying that the compensation had been provided. The customer care didn't understand the simplest thing-Rs15?Rs 420. I've forwarded below snippets of the conversation for you to decide whether to place orders on SWIGGY.  I urge everyone to refrain from placing orders with SWIGGY. SWIGGY initially had fair refund policies, but now even if you've missing items, it won't give you a single rupee back.  PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE ATTACHED SCREENSHOTS AS EVIDENCE.  -  Dear Customer,  Greetings from Swiggy!  We would request you to accept the refund and consider it a rare and one-time occurrence.  As the compensation has been already provided, we will no longer be able to compensate for the same.  Your disappointment is understandable however, we see that you have been associated with us for quite some time and we request you to give us another chance to serve you better. Please do not lose your hope in us.  We do value your relationship with us and hope to serve you better in the future.  Please feel free to contact us at swiggy.com/support for any further queries.

They send expired and damaged items and customer service is also worst  Pathetic experience  They don't provide any solution and waste time
Swiggy delivery boys paisa lut raha he aap zoon andar hi pair bhi automatically log out kar raha he. Or incentive cut Kar De raha he . Floting cash deposit karne se Floting cash kabhi kabhi cut nehi ho raha. Swiggy staff also no body copperat. No body receive our call .no body seen this message.
Order from Swiggy.but product not delivered showing delivered your order.after few minutes contacted support team we will help less.is there any possible to file case against case for looting money from public
They take orders to deliver beyond their manpower strength and later says will refund after 4-7 working days. This is their tricky way to snatch and earn intereston
I don’t want to write a long story.. in short I had a pathetic experience with Swiggy. After waiting for 1 hour after ordering neither the restaurant or delivery partner responded to call. Swiggy team said so easily that we are cancelling this order please place new orders which means again waiting for 1 hour after 11 PM.. so a person should wait for his diner till 12 AM.
"Delivery time showing 35 mins on app, delivery person arriving after 55 mins telling that there were multiple deliveries and customer support person Raveena is taking so much time to reply as her a girls BF has done something wrong and she is not replying for one hour by that time even the executive is telling me that yes they take a lot of time to revert back, their own employee ??  Zomato is much better, even though they are not giving free delivery like Swiggy One, but what they show is what you get!  Peace out!  PS: I abused to one of his employe in anger and rather than showing support and calming me down he discontinued the chat.  Badal I am also in customer support and I now feel proud of myself that I’m doing much much much better Job than you."
"Today my family ordered Ice-cream through Swiggy. After unusual delay when we checked we found that item was collected by the delivery man but he said there was heavy rush and delivery would get delayed. We thought something was wrong and tried to lodge a complaint. But no responsible person to reach, only chat mode was enabled.  When the ice-cream was delivered all the 4 containers were tampered and 30-50% in each was removed. When we tried to lodge a complaint we had to go through a lengthy procedure. As before no responsible person attended. The person attended was not regretful and was keen on protecting the delivery man. We spent nearly an hour in repeatedly contacting. Sunday evening was  As against ₹650 payment, they refunded only ₹260. We discarded all the 4 icecreams.  Such a worst experience with swiggy."
Woret exp i faced delivered d food after 2 hours and my naan got ruined and throw dat away nd den they did not help nd just disconnected my chat
"I ordered a watermelon and pineapple juice and fruit plate , I got apple instead,  After raising it to Swiggy support they gave me false promises and never gave me refund."
Swiggy has a new process now . It closes the customer concern saying thank you for your feedback without any resolution and most glorious part of Swiggy is supervisor herself is unable to provide a resolution and ask us to mail  Let us get to incident now :  I have ordered biryani few curries and white rice I have only received white rice and curries . I raised a genuine concern with them sharing the photos . I have called delivery agent either where he said he  would raise a concern from his end . When I raised a chat process the chat was closed saying we value your feedback. Then I got a mail saying we are not in your favour . Then I called the agent using customer support number and I spoke to supervisor to mention not team but supervisor who is highest point of contact . She says that the restaurant has said they have sent the order while the restaurant has not even attached bill by the way the restaurant is srikanya . When I provided photo all proofs still they say that I received all items . First thing I’m not the one who is so poor that I request money from Swiggy. My concern is there are people for whom order is a joy and once In a while to celebrate . Im writing this concern as it is repetitive now a days
"Swiggy, order food on 27-11-22 at around 11:40am, delivery time was 50mins but to my surprise the food was delivered at 3:09pm. My entire staff was waiting hunger for nearly 3 & half hours. Do you call this service?. Zomato does better job in service and if delays they keep us informed and also go to the extent of compensating the client for delay. No wonder and surprising Swiggy is no where close to it. My experience was very bitter and am a very dissatisfied customer and will never order on Swiggy ever again. I will also make it public with the order detains on social media. Highly pathetic service. The order was of 4506/- not a small amount. I will also post it on twitter so that people should know about your devices. Swiggy deserves a ‘0’ start as you are not work if even 1 . Your call centre guys offered me 100/- discount on 4506/- bill which every annoying. This show how cheap when compared to your close competition Zomato."
Worst customer service.Orderd 2 meals through swiggy and received only 1 meals.When contacted customer service they are asking to write mail to their customer care team and informed that have to wait for 24 hours to find out a solution.So as per their system we have to wait for 24 hours without having food ( missed items ) Great service by them......
Pathetic experience day by day  Tried swiggy genie aap guys charged bomb to send courier from kandiwali to versova 500rs  And i ordered food the food was half eaten when i opened my parcel i have been loyal with swiggy past 8 years now this is the worst aap guys trust me start using other apps
"I wrote a review for them on Google play and these guys deleted the review  Seriously you guys try to delete a review just show how pathetic you are. You guys gave did the mistake and now just blatantly deleted the review. Also, to all who read this do not even bother to reply for feedback mails they are going to repeat the same things that their so-called customer service executive says. First, they do not give you food and then they do not give you refund. And they actually deleted the review. The audacity is just over the roof. Don't download it's a scam.  -5 stars."
"Swiggy were never on time , worse part thier app always shows ""ontime"" even if they are late by half an hour ."
No talking manners with coustomer very bad experience I have ever seen very disappointed  I will never order by swiggy .........
"Worse delivery and customer service , .even after mentioning detail about my last 2-3 orders  Response i got from customer service was you can uninstall our app"
"Today morning I ordered some items and among the, I received French Beans and Fuji(/) apples which I had ordered for. Unfortunately, the beans will be fit for planting in few days as they are fit for seeding. They supplied some Indian apples in the guise of Fuji apples and having stayed in Singapore for over 4 years, I am well aware of how Fuji apples appear and taste also. This kind of cheating should be avoided by Swiggy Instamart if they wish to remain in Business else they will go the Faarzo way very soon. If they dont have quality stuff better they avoid supplying the same instead of taking the customers for a ride. Here after I made it a point not to make order for these products but only go for company made items."
I had raise the complete regarding the Rotten chicken not tasteless chicken but rotten chicken but swiggy guy came up and told me he can only pay only 65 rupees for this i said i don't .  need 65 rupees just need your SOP format for subscribing  He hung up the call  I need to know this  Fyi  Chicken smelling like pig i asked them to come and see it live but they say they have no option
"Swiggy is the one of the best food delivery apps.It helped me many times when I was late from the office during nights when all the restaurants and hotels are closed in my area. even when it is late night 11, I would receive my food within time and with good packing and parcel was always in good condition.The food was always hot and tasty. The delivery boys are also polite and good at understanding customers."
"They are cheating their customers, I bought a pizza where they were showing buy one get one free. The pizza price was 459 rupees. When I get the delivery i found only one pizza. Then I raised a complaint to their so called customer service. They chat with me for more than an hour, and didn't give me any solution., Meha, Jayanta and their supervisor they wasted my time, and they refund me only 135 rupees, which should be atleast half of the amount I paid for. They are all cheaters, liars and worst customer service team, they say they can not do anything. Just they can cheat people. I will suggest don't use this website."
"Fast devlivery, couteous delivery agent minimum calling lots of offers and discount are just few of many thing to mention if we compare it to compertiors sweggy offers mlore resturantts then other platforms"
"We ordered a pizza before 2 hours, after 1 hour some one calling from swiggy and told us to cancell my order."
No customer empathy..not smart tool to predict the delays..has gone from bad to worse. They are taking customers for granted thinking they are market leaders in food delivery..time to bring them down
Useless service...Swiggy ginne doesn't come on time...they take money in adv... doesn't cancel even after informing them ...no body calls up....must say these guys are fooling people...it happened 3/4 times ...swiggy delivery person doesn't deliver on time.
"Ordered a birthday cake, never reached the destination nor contacted on phone, the delivery guy picked it up and had a feast himself, customer care least bothered and only offering apologies, are they not able to contact the delivery person who does not respond when called??"
"Swiggy is fu most useless application. Because of the issues in its application they are simply cheating the people. Looks like this is how the swiggy is earning money, instead of the food business they have started creating the issues in the app and just cheating on the money.  In my case, I have ordered food and I was very particular about verifying the address before placing the order and even till delivery my address was rightly shown, but fuc delivery person and call center simply cheated saying that you have selected wrong address and money cannot be refund and they have looted full money on my order. If you cant handle the business fucstop doing it, bas."
According to my own experience Swiggy isn't the good food brand. Because last week i ordered julabjamun on this website and it test really bad.  Julabjamun have much sugar and not good test but the product price is high. 5 julabjamun cost ₹55 rs.  So i don't like it very well and i think don't try it.
"I have received vegetable from Swiggy. They are smelly, bad quality. I found worm inside cauliflower.. ..Oh God so bad smell. Really I can't expect such bad services from Swiggy. When I asked their customer care to refund they clearly said not possible wait for 6 days for investigation. After sending two clear images what proof Swiggy want to refund. It shows how prompt they are to make customer fool. Such app based vegatable deliveries are really bad. Also they rude to the customers. I can give negative review to Swiggy Instamart."
I order the food at 11:45 and it was 1 am and I didn’t got my order. Such horrible service they give also when I complaint about it they weren’t responding and only said wait your order will reach. Guys if you want your order on time then never order from this app!!
"I am regular swiggy user everything went alright while ordering in swiggy but recently may be in the last one year whatever we order while delivering few items will be missed this has happened many times each time when we raise queries the best response we get is refund but the thing is when we order and if the items are missed that too in a Sunday lunch or friends get to gather or with relatives, the items will not sufficient as few items will be missed.  I think swiggy working module miss some items in the order and let the customer suffer.  And refund later."
Order food on swiggy from eat fit hotel. The food is not good i felt sick and hospitalised. But swiggy people are not concerned about this .. they thought u am asking for a refund but i am asking for explanation and action about it
"I tried placing an order on swiggy but their server was slow and as soon as I made the payment, it got stuck and my money got debited....of course, the order wasn't placed as you'd expect and I wasn't refunded the money back. Also I wasn't allowed to make COD payments for a while.  Thus I was left hungry and moneyless by swiggy"
"My worst experience with swiggy, I have ordered Tropicana juice, by the time I received that seal is already removed. To raise any complaint on it I dint find any feasible option in the app to do so. I feel it’s really cheap performance of Swiggy. I highly disappointed with the application. I am gonna stop using Swiggy. It doesn’t worth even one star rating"
Ladies and Jentelman. Plzzz.Listen my worsds. I am dilvery boy. He stoped my account with out no reason. Iam coming from poor. And. Day by Day. Increase. My work. And 1month after they swiggy  company stoped my account. Always calling swiggy company. Money lost.. They till the u r account r deactivated. My mind full depression. My money lost my problem are fully. Plzzzz.. No rating from swiggy plzzzz
"One of the wrost application, they never resolve your problem and never connect call with customer care. They are not providing items as per the order and that things happen with me 2 times. I suggest never use this portal. Zomato is fare better than Swiggy"
"I had ordered food twice today. On both the occasions, they detected incorrect location, a difference of about 4 km. On the second occasion, the delivery person wanted extra payment for the long distance. Then a call came from their office informing that they are cancelling the order and forfeiting the entire payment for the order which they did."
My wife had order food from swiggy app @9.15 pm on 29 Oct 22. That time delivery time was showing 30 min.. We didn't get order till 22.15.When we called to swiggy delivery partner he didn't picked up the call. Then we called to swiggy toll free. The lady saying sorry for the inconvenience n did nothing. Our son sleep without having that food which he wanted. Most third class thing.
Please don't use swiggy genie.. delivery boy's are fake they will loss your products and there is no claim of it and no proof given. Delivery boys have fake Id's. Don't trust swiggy to send your valuable stuff or any stuff.
I order food today with order Id: 149868770464 but they delivered cold food which was cooked in the morning or noon and quality of food was worst. I served that food to street dog but dog also denied to eat. I interacted with swiggy customer care but their service is horrible instead of solving this issue they suggested me to put bad reviews against the restaurant from where I ordered food.
"I had a horrible experience with swiggy when i wanted to cancel my order with in 5 mins and they are charging 100% cancellation fee. When asked about the policy to be shared with me that where it is written , i was being told we dont share our policy with customers. They are just cheating people and conning them with so much charges and cheaging way more than consumer restraicted rules . They should be banned in food industry and also groceries. SWIGGY IS ONE BIG CHEATING SERVICE which is FOOLING Customers."
I have ordered a snack and cant get till 45 min after i called on swiggy they assigned a delivery agent that agent denied for delivery once again i call on swiggy they told that you can calcell the order. The worst company i have seen in my life
Its a really pathetic experience. Even I don’t want to waste single star for this company. for two hour I had been waiting for food but at the end asked for the refund. Hi
Delivered expired milk packet and five other wrong items. Complaint to customer care person. He said he would escalate and solution would be provided. But no solution provided . Made a complaint to fssai for selling expired items. Don't trust this store. Very delayed delivery. All other online stores are much better.
1) Did not receive one of the three items.  2) It's a horrible experience to contact customer service with only one way communication.  3) Delivery agent was rude and was not wearing swiggy shirt.  4) Swiggy app is a horrible experience.
Very bad service zomato is fast service very bad.
Swiggy delivery is not right... Cake full destroy karke diya... Aur much help bhi nahi ki... Swiggy se food na magaye...
Just stay away from these guys.  u order yesterday food in Delhi and delivery boy haven't delivered even waiting for 2 hr out side my house and regularly in touch with coustomer support but no one helped i had to sleep hungry and above that worst this they themselves cancelled order and charged me 100% cancellation fee  boss this is total fraud .  they are bunch of frauds keep away from them.
"I don't to give single Star also, i order is not placed my amount is debited, wasting time and money"
As I have order on swiggy from mc d. But I Didn't get my delivery.when delivery man went to mc d he informed that my order was taken by some other delivery man 2 hrs back. Were as I just ordered before half an hour and i didn't get my delivery...very bad experience...i lost all my time in contacting coustomer care.....when u are ordering my swiggy plzz chcek it with resturant and confirm it once...never expected this from swiggy????????
"Their delivery guys are rude. They took more than double the time to deliver my order . Talking to the restaurant guy revealed that the food has been cooked twice and thrown in dustbin because the delivery person kept on showing arriving on 1 min since last 45 mins.. talking to the delivery person, the guy is clue less and is not even apologetic . Complaint chat bot and the person responding in person has nothing other than sorry and thank you for feedback"
"When the order is delayed for more than 90min which was suppose to be 30min , we still cannot cancel the order as swiggy will charge the entire amount .but when they do not provide you the food they only have sorry for inconvenience after 1 hour .and some time they even call back to say that we do not have the alternate food also which we as a customer never asked for. Great customer service ""Swiggy"""
I first time oder on swggi but its very too much bed experience for me never oder on this app nothing I Oder my food
They make you wait for your order and then deliver partial order. Delivery partner click your picture instead of the food. They boast about delivering atleast half of the order and unapologetically rush to close your complaint.
"On 5th of October at arround 9 I ordered for 3 Butter Tandoori Roti's. I received the order and when opened to serve found that the Roti's were uncooked just soaked in butter with a very bad smell. I complained it at once and send photos and everything that they asked thru chat box. Till 9th I did not receive any response from them so again i tried to communicate tgru chat, now I was told to write am email to them. I did it. Again no solution and no response. This is nothing but a tricky cheating. I paid 170 for 3 butter rotis."
"I orderd a pizza and chocklate Sundae from ""SWIGGY ONLINE DELIVERY"" The DELIVERY AGENT GANESH with Executive ID ""169525""  has not delivered and he has eaten himself and updated in App that its delivered. When I called Swiggy the executive ""SUHAIL"" dint gives any  resolution except a SORRY. IS this the way online services are working are the customers are fool?  Their mistakes why customers should bear?  Why we should be hungry because of him?  Why these people employee this type of idiot delivery guys?"
"I ordered food from swiggy and it's been long the delivery didn't happened I checked status it was marked as delivered but I didn't got my parcel I complained to support and help section they gave me number of delivery person I called up but he didn't picked the call the same happened with the executive of the company also he tried but delivery boy inxxx jadxxx didn't answered the call.The executive asked me to mail, I did it but after 3 days now their was no response from higher authority also, and they claim that issue will be resolved within24hrs.I paid amount 499 for food through gpay .It was really saddestday as we all were hungry and also money was lost.I asked swiggy team to take order and deliver my food its their problem that their deliver boy did such a horrible thing and they should keep the trusted people.But after so many request and mail and complaints, messages, their is still no response from their side.I will only request people please don't pay money in advance.always keep cash on delivery option.And if possible Don't order food from swiggy  Regards"
"Today 09/10/22, 10 am I booked for breakfast at guru darshini dosa palace mysore through swiggy app. That time the app show 35- 45 mins for deliver. So it should be reach by 10: 45 max.  But 11 am I didn't got the delivery. So I called the delivery boy. It's not connected. At that time swiggy customer care executive called me that it will take another 35min to deliver my breakfast. So I hav to eat my breakfast at lunch time 11.35 - 12.00 noon . Thank you swiggy for gift me good day."
The are running it just to loot people. They take money from you and then do not even deliver your order.
Swiggy services in agra are utterly unprofessional.poor customer service. No escalation channels. An order placed was not even delivered one hour later than scheduled time. Explanation provided - we can't control delivery due to delivery partner personal reasons. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. AVOID USING THIS PORTAL.
"Ordered Bananas from Swiggy instamart and package arrived damaged with rotten bananas inside. On complaining to Swiggy by chat I was told “with due respect. I apologise for denying compensation. However we won’t be able to compensate you at this moment” I was asked to send a email as they needed to investigate further and I’m sure you guessed what the response by email was “With deep regret in regards to your order, we would like to inform you that we will be unable to initiate a replacement or a refund for this order.”  Avoid using this platform already there has been many complaints compiled about Swiggy and how they send poor quality food."
"This company is absolute garbage. They always forget items in the order, take the full payment and “help you” by giving coupons for the item that was not delivered. This amount does not even include the taxes charged or delivery fee taken. If you have an emergency or guests waiting, dont rely on their service. I am writing this review after experiencing this first hand multiple times. This was the last straw for me. I will be deleting the app. I now feel that their business is not to deliver products. It is to take cash for incomplete orders and give coupons so that they have cash and forced customers to use swiggy again with fees and taxes. Horrible horrible service"
Ordered the item. Delivery person accepted the order. But after sometime nearly half an hour he called me right and said he couldn't deliver the given order and asked me to cancel my order. He was rude even with the customer care person. It was unimpressive.
I booked document pickup with correct pickup & drop locations.  But after payment both the locations are showing same. I try to reach out them to tell about this it's not easy thing to connect with them.  I felt bad about this app and company.
"This is my review after using services of swiggy.. no traffic day they take more than 1 hour for 4 kms, given chicken instead of mutton, add chicken in between mutton .. when complained, pathetic customer support services, they say talk to restuarant we can't do anything, delivery guys eating our food and getting to us... Delivery person doesn't come to location and  Say we are not responding and cancel order n eat up our lone"
"I am a delivery partner for swiggy, We are not even provided a customer service number for emergencies. They treat us like trash when it comes to assigning orders and giving us our waiting time pay and incentives. These guys are the worst."
Pathetic service for delivery boy at the time of joining they did not tell terms and condition they told me if you deliver 60order in week u will get 3000 bonus they did not give me bonus I joined that company on Friday so one week will be completed next Friday but they told me at time of bonus they told me we will not give any bonus you dint deliver 60order because they count only two days Friday and Saturday guys you told me they did not told me.how they will count week days. And suddenly told you you did not delivered 60 order within two days Friday and saturday so how is possible and alos they did not give me joining bonus they are lier total froud don't join this ??????
My food item is not delivered at my home location and it's shown it's delivered and i have to send but there is not any reply. I have to lost my 300 ruppees.
"If there was an option to give negetive rating that would be it for Swiggy. Pathetic customer service. They lie about everything. They will never give you the refund. They keep dragging the issue. They deliver stale food, bad enough to cause food poisioning. The customer service reps are not only unprofessional but very rude and don't care about your time and money. Over all a complete disaster for a company."
Paid and ordered the food at 8:10 … the delivery guy picked the food after 45 mins … he didn’t delivered the food 22:40 … 7 times I called the customer two supervisor I spoke to … they can’t solve the problem till now 22:45 …. It’s the worst experience I got after paying for a food to get delivered …. Attached the document
Us din mene swiggy se kuch order Kiya aur 1.5 hours wait Kiya order Ane k liye gharpe khana bhi nahi banaya tha us din phir call Kiya delivery boy ko to vo uthaya hi nahi usne and swiggy se contact Kiya to vo bole k mam apka order me cancel Karu and vapas place karu kya mene bola thike kijiye phir vapas place karne k bad bhi order muze Ghar tak nahi pohocha and badme dusra delivery boy ne phone apane gharpe rakha tha and delivery k liye address tak aya and phir usase menta contact nahi ho paya uske ghar wale phone nahi utha rahe the and Mera Paisa to cut ho gaya but order nahi aya swiggy ko mene 2bar mail Kiya contact karane k koshish bhi k lekin unhone reply nahi Kiya and paise bhi refund nahi kiye aur upar se mail me muze bole k apko order deliver ho gaya tha aapane food waste Kiya that was really bad
Wrost food experience don’t use swiggy app I would like to preferred Zomato better than swiggy please stop using swiggy wrost app
Food quality is very poor. Customer support executive not support there valuable customer. Customer care executive not handle the customer problem.
Restaurant charges exorbitant prices that is fine but is sending spoilt smelly stale food  There is no way for addressing concerns by Swiggy. This restaurant has to be banned
Pankaj kumar is the one of ur rider is behavior is very worst.He doesn't how to talk with restaurant manager and one more thing he is painic with daily target.  Order no.146592227384
"Swiggy was my go to food delivery app since years... Until I came across a worst customer support response recently. I wonder if there a manager to look over this dept or anyone responsible to handle customer grievances, to check how many issues are resolved etc... This is the beginning to its end of business.    We paid for an order 1500 rs. Order was not delivered. 2. Customer support chat service says ""we will mark the order delivered and then resolve in 2 days."" We were not okay with it. But, they seem to have this only one option and nothing for more than half an hour of chat. We agreed. 3. No response, no followup until a week. Call option not available for past orders. Only chat. great!!!! 4. We opened the chat again to follow up. They say ""we will forward this to concerned team and it will take 2 days to resolve"". So, this will go in circles... Until when??? 5. I'm never using this Swiggy again. Rest of my family uninstalled the app. I too will do it if by any chance the issue has to resolve or when I feel that my money is gone for charity, not charity, for goons."
Very disappointing on this time they given me stolen food spoiled food I’m spending 200 rs and waste my 1 hr time on it any from swiggy not responding anything it’s your responsibility to check food quality.
I cancelled my order and I paid for it rs.789 and it was not refund to me and it's the food also not delivered for me I am new to order in online soo I gave wrong address and that's why I cancel my order is the rs.789 is refund for my account or not pls refund my money
"I ordered products worth rs 1611 from my brothers account, swiggy cancelled and denied to refund the amount also. Goons lf the society."
They are not listening to customer in any thing  I had experienced in last few orders that swiggy is good for nothing as they don't give their customer any importance as after 60 seconds customers cann't do anything as i recived a one order a hour late and we don't have the option of cancelling it.  Second and third order received less quantity and they have no solution at customer care and their senior after putting mail.  Not recommend anyone to use swiggy.
"I place the order instamart bangalore Koramangala branch order no 2571, but one item grapes missing in the delivery. Big cheater"
I thought Swiggy is a big brand but they are big fraudsters they will steal your hard earned my without reason would like to request everybody who all are reading this just tagged them everywhere just prompt them everywhere so they cannot cheat or fraud with genuine people
Swiggy delivery doesn't know how to ride bikes. Because of them I had an accident that swiggy delivery man ran away before I got up that f..king delivery person.
Never ever send Mr. Abin Baby to deliver my orders. He was super rude with me and humiliated me in front of mt neighbors. I haven't pinned exactly. For that he kept on talking. He should call his office.. He cannot come like that. Where is the location. Several times I told him. But instead of listening he was talking talking and talking.I informed the customer care. They apologised. I'm. Living with an elderly sick mother. This man was asking don't you have brothers or sisters. To come along with him to get the change. Or asking me to come with him at night to get the change of 500.Worst experience in my life. He says he is not a beggar. Then what he think of a customer. His slave or enemy?? Is this the way swiggy train their delivery partners to deal with a customer. This guy is not fit to work in this field. He was talking as if he will beat me. I was literally shivering. I need an explanation from swiggy Or else I will take this matter to court.
I have ordered food from swiggy on 4th may 2022. Swiggy delivered food with insect. After having this food i have vomiting. I complained swiggy they are not ready to take action.  Order no- 145379189657.
This is second time I have received the kharab food earlier it was ice cream melted full and now this time full smelly eggs I am going to cancel my subscription with swiggy.  After smell eggs I vomit even though.  Very bad experience of swiggy instamart food quality.
"Missing items from instamart delivery and took full money two times in one week, cheaters and fraud!"
"I am a regular buyer of Swiggy Instamart. Today a delivery boy came with a big complaint that our house is in so interior and why swiggy have taken this order, even why we placed d order. Also why we don't stay at apartment.I am so shocked with d words he uttered. I don't this they have that authority to insult people like that. In addition, 1st time we have received a puffed rice pack with a big whole. So it's a total metal harassment and monetary loss. Please look into d matter as early as possible because it was so unexpected from a Band Name like Swiggy."
3rd class service. Swiggy has cancelled my order it's own without any information. Online showing partner is on the way to deliver
"I order today and get missing items , my quest waiting for food and unfortunately I had to cancel it due to missing and wrong item , very harsh experience with swigggy, never order from swigggy ever."
I have order mutton curry but I have received Alu curry I have reised complain but team will be not responding timely this bad experience in this site
I ordered a cake for my friend's birthday...added a location which was clearly visible on Google maps....once the delivery guy reached d place...i called him multiple times but he he didn't pick up my call ..n ultimately cancelled the order...i didn't recieve any refunds....worst application ..the same thing has happened to my multiple friends as well.  Worst experience.
Drunken delivers bad experience bad behaviors please don't order on swiggy please please please very bad service bakwas
"Swiggy's instamart is EXTREMELY slow. It takes literally an hour or more for your stuff to reach you when they advertise it as 30 minutes. I've tried a couple of other delivery services, and have had much better experiences in terms of fast delivery. They have literally reached me in less than 20 minutes. But Instamart, has become a hassle. I've been slowly meandering away from Instamart."
"Dear Friends,  am highly recommend you guys, pls dont book any orders via swiggy this is a worst customer support team & I have own experience for this.  I have booked 1 order for this app by miss my amount got deducted 2 times after I applied for the refund its been 15 days till now there is no response for these guys. the same thing am faced issue with zomoto those ppl respond immediatly & arrange my refund with 24 hours.  But these swiggy team was unfit to do serve the customer's, useless emails not repling geniounly.  am going to give -10% for this team"
I use this app for delivering food the delivery comes on time also the delivery man talks very well and have a friendly behaviour.
"As usual the service of Swiggy has been worst, I ordered 8.15pm and I was supposed to get in 30 mins, but received a call after 1.15 mins and informed me that my order will take another 20-30 minutes. With this it is quite evident that these fellows unable to manage their business and charging exorbitant prices in the name delivery charges and surge, this is nothing but looting."
The response after complaining on items missing from the order was surprising.  After careful scrutiny the compensation is rejected. What was that careful scrutiny made? When the restaurant itself has confirmed that there was no outer covering and seal for the package.
"No proper response from customer support and if we want to cancel order customer support keeps lagging and dont respond immediately.  No proper delivery partner assignment and order takes too longer to get delivered. Swiggy charges too high delivery rates, but don't deliver on time.  Even after complaining multiple results is same and no improvement. They say sorry for the inconvenience we will take care in future. But that never happens.  Very bad experience.  I want to rate 0 , but no option so rating 1"
Excellent service very happy with the service they provide deliveries are on time Thank you Swiggy ??.
"We will answer you shortly, we apologize or we will revart with in 48 hours . Two persons come at my home they were drunk. Not wearing swiggy dress and not having swiggy bag.how can i know from where they are.  I don't think any one should make a order if there parents are not at home."
"I want to order idli 1 plate the price is 39 rupees, but your taking extra 58 rupees. This is very horrible.u take 10 rupees extra ok."
My complaint for swiggy instamart grocery delivery related If product missing from my order they don't take any action if quality of product is poor they dont take any action and always told please complaint in our email address and when I will mail their answer is same that we don't refund and replace the product so it is worst app.
Please Never order your food in swiggy it never came on time all my orders happened to be delayed....they purposely will delay it and apologies with offers...they does me many times ...
"Swiggy customer care sucks! Once the money gone, they really don't care about customer satisfaction. Whatever, you order from swiggy these days, either you have quality issues or quantity issues. It's not one of the cases. It has happened multiple times now. And when you complain about it, swiggy has such a poor customer services now."
Used swiggy genie to pick up the cake. It was picked up from the store but never got it delivered. One of the worst experiences I have ever had. Never trust swiggy.
"Today I decided to uninstall swiggy app and I will not avail their ugly service again.  I am writing this review after a series of bad experience and hence decided to let public to know about this.  I understand that on a typical weekend majority of the are people might have no interest to cook and wish to try something from outside. Apparenrly, that results a plethora of orders for these food delivery partners. However, waiting for long 2 hours for food and got to know from the restaurant that it is picked up atleast an hour ago which means something phishy, not acceptable and Ridiculous., unprofessional. No ethics, No commitments. Food is an important part of daily life and hunger can't be substitute with any other alternative. Enough and more than enough. Tired of listening these guys trivial excuses and shameful coupons. Everytime paying a considerable amount for home delivery and why no show? Shame! Please quit!  Guys, please do not rely on swiggy. One or another day you will realise what I am trying to convey here.  One star. And no more Swiggying! Please educate your employees and make them understand the value of customer relations.  Good bye!"
"Pathetic experience, they cheat, I ordered food in Delhi. Despite knowing the address they refused to deliver the food, and cancelled my order forcibley, they debit the entire amount as cancellation fees what a cheating. Order value was Rs 645, cancellation fee Rs 625. WOW  Food eaten by their delivery partner.  Order Number 143477376272  Dated 13 - 8 - 2022  Place New Delhi"
Dont use swiggy.  I had very bitter experience regarding swiggy.  They will not refund your money. Their delivery partners eat food. Food from swiggy is not properly packed.  Zomato far better.
"There's no delivery partner to deliver our order, I have ordered mask bun from swingy at 07:07am, confirmed at 07:08am, not delivered still 09:00am, hence I cancelled this order, this is not good experience, request to please improve in delivery section. there's is no delivery man."
This is the worst place I have experienced. Whenever I have order food it's just full of mistkakes. Nothing else.  From my side 0 rating.
They cancelled the order and didn't even refunding us and asking for cancellation fees but we didn't even cancel and talking abusivly
"I had got swiggy coupon from my credit card bank.due to covid, I could not use the same.  There are other service providers too who extended date.  Swiggy has been Adamant on not extending inspite of repeated requests.  Due to same, I feel the customer service is very poor and we should not support swiggy due to adamant behaviour."
I have placed order for my husband’s birthday and i got the damage cake I paid 829 for 1 kg cake. When i received the cake I complained the same time on their chat support but they didn’t accept their mistake and refused to help me our and asked me to mail them. I have also sent a mail to them with all the details but they didn’t do anything.
"Fighting for refund from one month, but refund not received. This is a cheater group. Every day i am chatting and sending e mails to support team but no action taken for refund."
Ordered Veg Biryani from Barbeque nation Hadpsar. Fried turmeric rice with few pieces of beans and peas. Worst experience. Swiggy is not giving full refund. Its of no use.
Not even delivery executives fault but t he Swiggy even got its horns on their head even after paying the taxes delivery chargers and etc food never been d Delivered on right time never been helpful towards their customers. Swiggy is serving to give customers their food faster and in hot great conditio but it doesn’t happen at all it’s not my first time to experience this type from Swiggy. Swiggy giving two orders at the same time to a delivery executive for delivery. Then if the second customer have to suffer with his cold food  Why do even people order on Swiggy platform and make the swiggy run to pay you for delivering food fast and easy in great condition or cold food in maximum time even after the ETA. Better I could have gone to the store and would have brought my food in just 20-25 mins the time took to Swiggy was 1hr 10 mins
I had bad experience in there service today I had to wait nearly 40 to get my assigned delivery partner for my order I cancelled my order due to no availability of delivery partner near restaurant they deducted my entire amt of order which was around 500 for order I couldn't not receive even one rupee refund on my cancellation
Ordered and wished to cancel my order for change of address for which SWIGGY deducted my entire payment towards cancellation fee and Be VERY CAUTIOUS with this fraudster for 100% cancellation fee.He has to be sued before Consumer Court and I dont know how many customers did SWIGGY cheat like this.
The Swiggy app and delivery agents are just looting customers.. they don’t take ur calls .. then cancel ur orders stating that they tried connecting wid u.. then then keep the full amount as cancellAtion fee.  i had ordered a cake for my cousin.. I got call from customer service 2-3 times but I was not able to hear anything from other end .. it was completely blank.. Then again I got call.. customer care executive told me that we are not able ro locate address.. I was about to share alternate number but again it went blank.. then I tried calling delivery person through app and even messaged him alternate number .. but he didn’t bother to check that message.. n then suddenly got message that order is cancelled and whole amount will be deducted as cancellation fee..
Unfortunately there is no option to give 0 stars.  They don't have control on their delivery staff. This is the 3rd instance when the delivery person has switched off his mobile after picking up the food from restaurant. Which ultimately leaves me with an option to uninstall Swiggy app and never ever install that app again.
I ordered a meal from this app and I get a spilt package with buttermilk all over..When spoke with the agent he asks to share the pics and asks for more clear pics and claims I am lying...From the door to my kitchen I have spilt buttermilk on my white floor and they are asking for clear pics...we use them for our convience and they are taking advantage of it .swiggy food or insta Both are pain...
"Today I have book the order and after his representative told me your carry other delivery boy. You would like to terminate or replace the order, he will deliver within 15 minutes and after 1/2 hr he cancelled the order an"
"Worst service, swiggy are always delay my order, they guys never reply on chats , wastage of time and money also"
Pathetic customer service. Why do you guys do business with restaurants that offer pathetic food quality. Very disappointed. Swiggy should shut its business. Worst experience.
My sister ordered 2000+ range in order as here company gave privilege to reimburse we asked swiggy to send gstbill but they send us a bill which is 200+ range bill we request somany times to swiggy but no use they implement delayed tactics
"On Friday I ordered food at 1 pm under fast delivery for my son to be delivered at his Institute. The time was showing 21 minutes and as per app delivery boy was restaurant.  Thanks to swiggy world class excellent and commendable service, food was delivered around 2pm. Thanks again to Swiggy my son was unable to eat food and was hungry and attending class without food.  When called to swiggy, they have nothing to say, we are sorry, we apologize, we understand your situation, pls wait, delivery parter was unable, there were multiple delivery, we understand your frustration, this will not be related, we have shared your feedback.  We can cancel your order if you do not want to wait. We can offer you Rs. 100 coupon, which is fake and cannot be used anywhere. This is after experience, where coupon provided never work.  Once the food was never delivered, just kept me waiting for more than one hour, once the packing was torn, twice food was delivered late.  The standard reply is sorry.  They don't care for customer, they charge hell lot of money and dont have transparency, attitude or commitment for service.  Swiggy just believe in earning money, cheating, fooling, humiliating, insulting, take for ride and giving false and un reliable information to customer.  They treat customer as beggar and humiliate by offering coupon of Rs. 100.  When ask for justification, turn the topic to food quality to avoid.  THIS IS WHAT SWIGGY IS, MOST UNRELIABLE, UNTRUSTWORTHY AND JUST BELIEVE IN EARNING MONEY AND FOOLING, HUMILIATING, INSULTING CUSTOMER AND TAKING FOR RIDE. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CUSTOMER SATISFACTION POLICY.  Further delivery person is great, if after giving delivery instruction not to call, he calls several time and my son have to leave clas to receive the food.  SWIGGY DOES NOT CARE FOR CUSTOMER, VALUE CUSTOMER TIME AND MONEY.  ONE SHOULD KNOW THE REAL FACE OF SWIGGY AND GIMMICKS PLAYED BY THEM HARASS THE CUSTOMER."
"Cheating app, many such experiences at different locations. Priced much higher than at hotels with added extra fees, for delayed deliveries and soggy fries. Missing cola bottles"
High rates and pathetic service. Don't use it! When conpared to takeaway rates the rates in app are on a very higher side even after discounts.
"It used to be a good app but now it's pathetic, rude delivery agents, pathetic customer service who use to laugh when you are discussing your complaint with them and restaurants sending pathetic food because they also know swiggy is not going to anything. In last one week i have placed two complaints one was against restaurant and other was against delivery agent none of them got resolved and no one get back to me on that . Do not waste your money on this app."
"Did 2 orders, none of them delivered.No information given by swiggy until asked and customer support told me that the delivwry partner's bike has problems so we cant deliver.I waited for 4 hours and placed 2 separate orders and same thing happened again"
My last order was yuked disgusting delivery partner argued shouted about location and denied to order me tasteless vomit feeling seriously worst experience i received by swiggy Zomato never do that
We order combo briyani in spice paradise in that briyani we found a warm inside the biryani but customer service not responding properly worst experience in swing management team why ur support Like this restaurant inthis pandamic situation
I had ordered one simple order and these PPL are so dumb as hell... 1st had problem with the food thing ... Don't have item... They replaced it.. then can't find adress properly ... Like i feel swiggi shd ease our living... In revers it made my lunch time hell... So worst my god
I ordered dahi wada from swiggy was worst one ever. They are not receiving my calls. I want to cancel this order and my money back. But I suffered loss.
"Swiggy.com always care about money. I had a conversation with Poulami and then with Subhash and then Mohammed Jaffer (from Senior team). All of them wasted my time. I was on a conversation with these guys since 1 and a half hour. They don't value time, money, feelings.. nothing. All they will say is ( we Apologise, sorry, can't do anything). If you can not....why you are even there??? Don't even know how to delight the customers. They will ask you to wait...and pass on your conversation to someone else saying that we are connecting you with senior team...(who will offer you Rs.100) hahaha... finally after waiting so much. C'mon. You keep it. Guys, leave the compensation part. They don't even refund the exact amount of the missed items. They will keep apologizing and talk about future. They don't care about your experience. They will shut your mouth by saying : hum kuch nhi kr skte. We have limitations. So don't chase them for anything. You'll end up with NOTHING."
"Today I ordered 3 items 1 item was missing and didn't provide the bill, the same thing I've written a mail to swiggy and asked for the refund of 3rd item as I paid for it and received, they are so irresponsible and informed me they're not going to provide my refund. This is the way they treat the customer. Stupid service. Simply charged for it which I've not received."
"Have you ever wondered what does it feel like going to sleep on an empty stomach? Ordering from Swiggy will surely give you that kind of feeling nowadays.  Ordering from Swiggy is now a very painstaking task. Moreover, the delivery guys that they recruit have the audacity to reply back saying, "" khud banake khao"". Is this your act of professional behaviour?  No matter what swiggy should be blacklisted from Indian market. Zomato rules."
"Wrong item delivery , mismatched contents , delayed delivery ..many such complaints were raised with the customer service .there is no or reckless response. I have had a loss of around 1000 rs but would claim for a fair enough rs 500 from Swiggy and ask them to learn to behave with customers . Time to keep up your goodwill"
"Price bhhot high rakhte hai phle he fir dikhane ke liye jhoote discount lga dete h ?? h real m wo utne normal burger pas ki shop se lene jao to sasta padega yar, urgently kuch khane mein chahiye to he use kro waste of money h really????????????  .  Itni jldi rhti hai inko ki Jala hua and kabhi to bina paka he le ate h ye log pet kharab hoskta h  .service shi nhi h??????????"
"Worst customer service and food never gets delivered in time.  I emailed them as asked to do by the call centre the reply of which is exasperating and also I’m putting down email and reply is in the photo:  Hi,  I am writing to complain about the food that was delivered late and cold. My first concern is that the food was delivered 45 mins late and was cold as turkey. Food like pizza is meant to be consumed hot/warm because if it gets any cold, the quality deteriorates, and the bacteria in bread can cause issues in the stomach when cold(contaminated). Unfortunately, I couldn’t even consume it and it was wasted. Besides, I have had a long day with bouts of emotions as my granddad passed away and by not having eaten a morsel, pizza was asked to be delivered but the situation as mentioned above was uncalled for. A viable solution to be fair to this is a full refund as I couldn’t even consume it.  Secondly, After trying to reach out to customer support, they clearly were not helpful enough which is why I have to reach out to you for the same. Except for the last rep I spoke to (he was understanding) other reps weren’t as helpful as him. Customer service plays a pivotal role in any company’s success but if the customer service causes a disconcerting after-service and annoying situation as the help needed isn’t received, even after explaining, being benovolent , then definitely, something’s internally wrong.  In conclusion, What I am looking for is you to remediate and kindly refund me the money for my order as I deserve to have back the money for the food that I couldn’t eat as it turned in cold. Besides, coach people for better service.  Sincerely,  Writwick Dhivare"
Fungus formed instant paratta sold in Swiggy insta mart  Bad smell product  Manufactured 2011 November  Need action  If anything happens to out health condition Swiggy insta mart is the reason
"Yesterday I had a very bad experience with Swiggy. The order was not delivered and initially the full amount was charged on me as cancellation charge. After repeated complaints, only 50% was refunded. I was informed later that the delivery partner tried to contact me over telephone and waited at my doorstep 34 mins. If he really was at my door, why did he not press the doorbell?  I am feeling that I have been cheated and have resolved not to order through Swiggy in future"
Mujhe wrong order ka refund nhi mila or swiggy walo ko customer se koi matlab nhi koi nhi sunta customer ka rupee barbad ho ya na ho swiggy ko to rupees se matlab hai customer se nhi or ek baat order to wrong hai hi wo order bhi jala hua h...
I order around 1.30 pm and I filled my complete address with landmarks due to an app issue location detected was wrong. I spoke to a customer support person he is not ready to convince the rider not ready to refund my money back he is not accepting app issues he agree that I filled the correct address after a long discussion that was more than one hour there was no solution rider is not pick up my call he cancels the order directly I am hungry I explain this to customer support if order cancel I have to sleep empty stomach still there is no support not even refund my money. i will report this issue & screenshot as much as possible to all social sites & call recording too so that in the future no hungry needy people can suffer choose better options then swiggy # worseeeee fraud
I ordered food in swiggy and I punched in my address. Sometimes later I got a phone call from delivery boy and I found that the food was sent to some other address. I told him the correct address but he simply cancelled the order. My payment was not refunded . I immediately contacted the customer care. They informed that they will try to deliver the package. But it was never delivered and when I contacted swiggy customer care the next day I was told that the order was cancelled by me. I had all call records but the customer care executive did not care and disconnected the line. This is a fault of swiggy apps for which I suffered.  Such is the type of fraudulent service by the customer care of swiggy
Pathetic services are offered by swiggy.  i have ordered food yesterday and their boy didn't delivered the food but received a message that the food has been delivered then i have reported the issue through chat and many people they also said his delivery boy number is not reachable i told everyone to refund my amount but they have no common sense hence converted my amount into coupon and forcing me to use that coupon else i have to leave my amount.  They all are cheaters making money by encouraging such activities within their team.  They should feel ashamed of by doing such things
"Ordered pizza from pizza hut thru swiggy , the connect person as flashed in swiggy order is busy after multiple calls would able to connect , his closerwith me is for toprovideBill hardcopy along with delievery , But neither pizza hut is bothered nor swiggy person is concerned , bill is not given with delievery , then keeping pizza aside with almost 14 + calls as dial , i won battle to connect with swiggy chap to raise my concern ,  892134xxxx [20 dialed calls in total ] swiggy chap [ he is always polite ] , End result after spending 600 perks for single pizza - which got cold with spoil mood , follow up with swiggy , and then pizza hut , i decided not to order thru swiggy + Pizza put gota ahmedabad - pizza hut staff is also uncooperative , weired , uneducated , use foul langague , aa jaa dekh leta hn , aa kar bata , shamefull patch ."
Very poor service and worst response. I ordered food and after 2 hours they delivered. Food was cold and not able to have. If we cancel it will go to swiggy wallet. Again a mess.
First of all there services are worst and they usually charged tripple the amount as compared to the fare the actual resturant is providing never ever try to book ur service from them hey are worst in service and very costly as well I don't recommend it at all..
Bakava service chore hai 2 ghate phele payment kar or oder bhi nhi aya dinner ka time tha koi sulstion nhai hai inke pass only excuse hai delivery distance only 5 minutes ka hai or 2 ghate mai bhi oder nhi ata choor hai
"Swiggy will not be able service customers with the promised standards any more, since most of their employees do not speak the truth and that has tampered the reputation of the company  Please use Zomato or Amazon food or Dunzo"
Services are going worst day by day. Instamart service are prepaid and they don't deliver order and not even refund money to customer. They are making money by froggery. I will lodge complain in consumer forum.
What I like most about this application is it's provide food at our doorstep at very good cost and quality. This application is used by for most of the time because I can easily order my food from my favourite near by resturant or food store a get it within 30-40 min. Of ordering. I also like the way they provide there customer support services like if any food is found to be not good then they will provide us monkey back that's truly amazing for me. Also real time food tracing system is also one of my favourite feature of this application.
Hello today I am going to share my honest review about swiggy. This is a one of the worst service I seen in my life because they always deliver food very late and even prices also higher than restaurant and there listed very poor restaurant and food quality also very badI always disappointed from swiggy because of the late delivery and very customer service they are not responsible and won't care about customers this experience happen always when I order from swiggy thank you this is my review about swiggy app
For the first time in so many years swiggy delivered a wrong order to us. We ordered one veggie delight without onion and they delivered 2sandwiches one with chicken and both with onions. What a blunder of delivering non veg sandwich to pure vegetarians . Thought this should be notified and they just refunded the money without having courtesy to compensate or collect back the parcel. What a pathetic experience. All this mishap should have been attended to with much more care and concern.
"Payment through card doesn't work, most of the time in swiggy app and even after multiple complaints, they still haven't fixed it"
Swiggy is such a pathetic platform of service sector... They cancelled my order after 2 hrs i.e. At night 11 o clock without any information.. they said some other rider picked up ur order that's y we r not able to send u order.... How rubbish...
"Today I placed my first food order on swiggy and as it is new for me I forgot to place instructions for food preparation. I don't see any option to edit and update from my end. So I called the customer care and a representative named ""Ritesh"" said they dont have restaurant contact number to reach and update instructions. What do you think? Pathetic . If I have to cancel I have to pay in full as cancellation charges. As there are other platforms which I feel better compared to swiggy. THIS IS MY FIRST AND LAST SWIGGY ORDER. Hope this will help not to get into Swiggy trap."
Swiggy ke sath mein last 5 salon se Juda hua tha lekin aaj pahli bar aisa Laga ki vah galat platform tha vahan per Maine aaj order kiya tha to vahan Jo Rider ne mere se jis tarike se baat ki thi vah mujhe bilkul bhi Pasand Nahin aaya and Maine complaint dalkar to senior person se baat ki thi jyada kharab tha Shweta please call me 77370xxxxx
"Be ware of the recent fraud played by swiggy. They don't deliver the food, the delivery partner cancelled the order, and swiggy charged thousands of rupees as 100% cancellation fee. We tried to reach their customer care executives, they were all mean and extremely unprofessional."
I’ve been on chat for 50mins explaining myself about the cancelling the order as the address that was chosen was incorrect with a delay 10-15seconds I was charged 100% cancellation fee spoke to a guy name Govinda over the phone who assured me write to us we will investigate and refund your charges and now I get an email stating we’re sorry the charges are valid as the restaurant had already prepared the order - wich restaurant prepares an order in 15seconds ? And secondly I spoke with the restaurant who cancelled the order and asked me to do it on the app and now because I was late by 15seconds I have bare the cost- is this how you treat your valuable customers by giving them a run around and then doing nothing to help? Your customer service rep itself takes 3mins to pick up a chat they come online and say please wait and vanishes and you expect the customer to return in 1min? I have never such disgusting service
"Had a couple of bad experiences with swiggy. In both cases, Swiggy was unable to assign a delivery partner on time.  In the first case, they cancelled the order. In the second case, I cancelled the order because of a 45 minute delay in assigning a delivery partner. It was already 930 pm and we decided to cook something instead of waiting forever. Well, i had to pay the entire bill as cancellation fee. They cannot do this after making me wait for more than half hour after ordering. Even if they did find a delivery partner, it would have taken another 45 mins for the parcel to reach me. I feel this was very unfair. Thumbs down Swiggy."
Fraud Company Worst Food Delivery Worst Customer Service Worst Delivery Man Worst Customer Satisfaction FRAUDS.
My order was unavailable asked to refund nitesh asked me the mode of refund than texting enjoy ur meal. Order was not process nly how can u say enjoy ur meal. Plz train properly ever1 always not in r8 mood asking same questions multiple times
Tasty food portion is also large well done.....
"Cheating delivery boys. Without deliver the products, update as delivered. Waste of time and energy."
On 1st May I had ordered Drinks on Swiggy App in their Liquor division. Rs.420/- was immediately deducted from my account & credited to Swiggy account. Immediately the App closed without completing my order.  On contacting support repeatedly they insisted “amount not captured from our end” and to contact my bank. My bank confirmed deduction of amount & statement too shared with swiggy  But still they kept on saying “amount not captured from our end”. No one was bothered to call me to solve this.  Ultimately due to poor service I did not got the ordered item & lost my Rs.420/- by Swiggy.  This is how they cheat customers their own money.
I have ordered food today at 10pm and expected delivery time was 30 min. But till 11pm I have not received my order. When I called to the delivery person he has not received the call. And when I called to the customer care inspite of helping me they have cancelled my order and refunded the money. I have a small kind of 1year and cancelling my order at this time was very pathetic. Customer care PPL has spoken to me for 1hr but didn't give me the resolution and still they kept call on hold and not responded back for almost around 15min. The person who spoke to me was Ruksar as senior. Prior one more lady spoke but unable to give resolution.
I really don’t like the services of swiggy…always late delivery…. Always order gets delayed bt 1 hour… executives don’t pick calls…  Zomato services are much faster and quicker than swiggy.  ????
"I ordered double choc chip cookies and was given single choc chip. Similar thing happened on my last order, on both the instances swiggy said they’ll look into it and didnt respond despite several follow ups. Customer agents use random terms like we understand but cant help."
"Swiggy partner app is totally fraud and they are charging from the outlet without consent .  An executive used to call and tell to run the promotion campaign on our outlet and without full info that how much amount will be deducted from our account , they deducted the amount and now our account balance is shown in minus .  This is like a scam that's why we discontinued our outlet service on swiggy app .  There is also no one from swiggy help desk who can figure out our problem .  If this will continue swiggy app will be vanish from market soon ."
"We ordered dinner, and the app showed food will be delivered within 20 minutes. But after 20 minutes also they didn't assigned delivery boy. Then after 35 minutes they allotted a boy and the app showed the boy is waiting at restaurant, hotel is preparing food, your food will be delivered within 10 minutes. I called up hotel and requested to prepare food at the earliest to the delivery boy. To my surprise, hotel told ""madam food is ready, swiggy boy has not yet reached"". Then I called up delivery boy, why you have not yet reached. He said I am on the way will reach within 2 minutes. To my surprise, I got message, that boy cancelled and another boy has been assigned, your food will be delivered within 20 minutes. Again after 10 minutes another boy got assigned and the app showed ""your food will be delivered within 25 minutes"". Then we lost patience and searched for cancel the order worth rs.1150/- and there was no option. No customer support option. Our money got wasted, they kept us hungry our aged parents who were patients. We brought food from llocal and finished our dinner. After 26 minutes of our dinner another delivery was assigned who brought the food packet. We returned back the food as already we had finished our dinner. The boy took the food back. But our money is with SWIGGY only.  WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER SEEN.  I BRING TO ALL YOUR NOTICE THAT PLEASE DONT ORDER ANY FOOD THROUGH SWIGGY. EVEN IT IS NOT FIT FOR ONE STAR.  ZOMATO IS BEST AND ACCURATE."
"Swiggy failed to deliver order on time, delivery p  Boy came after one hour after food was prepared and force me to take cold food. I complained to swiggy customer support but their system told me that I will have charged that order amount on next order. And I replied I am going to uninstall this useless app"
Delivery boy does not how to talk. Very poor manage ment system. Food packaging and way of carry was not good
Worst experience and look at the screenshots nothing has been delivered. Initially they said 40 mints than 1 hr delivery guy dint move a inch and worst customer service as well please do not use this app
Wrost service by swiggy without delivering order to home full money taking as return fee Delivery person is trying to come customer to collect order from main Road
It's the best aap for food delivery and has tie-ups with as many restaurant as they can find in India. Food and Packinging quality is the highlight of swiggy  Thank you ?
Worst company ever. They will cancel food order if it will take one hour or more than one hour instead handover to another delivery guy.
"Worst food app. I ordered two items but they delivered only one item. When I called the customer support and inquired, they are asking me send email. They stole my money and on top of that I should complaint them by email without having food. Zomato is 100% better than Swiggy."
I m never going use neither swiggy nor theobroma for ruining the birthday by sending stale and smelly cakes..don't deserve to be such a brand in the market.. shut down the business
"Swiggy is the worst food delivery app I have ever used. Not just once but multiple times I have faced delays of more than 90 minutes and cancellations too after waiting for 1-2 hours. The customer care executives take no accountability whatsoever. u r left writhing in hunger until the last minute wondering when ur food will finally arrive only to get to know at the end of Couple hours wait that the food won't come at all. Please, do not use Swiggy for ordering... There r better options available such as zomato, I recommend to never ever rely on Swiggy as your 'hunger saviour'."
I just ordered Khichdi from Zomato worth 300 rs and when I checked on Swiggy price is 390.  there are lootong people with higher price Go for zomato guys
"Hi  I had ordered for a product on Swiggy and they sent me a defective items, and the worst part is that they do not give refund or replacement.  Please do not order on Swiggy Instamart."
I would not recommend to place orders on this app.. their service is Terrible and their customer service is far more worse.. They will assign multiple order to a single person and by the time you receive your food...it's totally inedible and total waste of Money and time..
After ordering and paying for the food waiting for almost an hour delivery guy updated as delivered without even giving the food such a cheaters scam they are they keep food for themselves or give to neighbours then tell I already gave the item sucha ridiculous they never agree ther fault nor the customer service support or anybody full of scam and cheaters never ever order anything in this shity app now food gone money gone they are very careless do not ever trust and order anything this ain't the first time happened REPORT this app this app don't even deserve a single star shame on u guys
"It's a ver pathetic experience with swiggy, using it almost from last 3 years but first time want my order cancellation and says that you have to cancel within 1 minutes. It takes around 2 minutes at least to cancel order if Iwant cancel myself without any asking. And the customer care staff is very pathetic and process is more, took my all money with any delivery. Felt cheeted, will go for social media options for companies and also with my circle  And the customer care staff took all my money as re"
I have faced this problem 4 times with Swiggy. The Swiggy people will never find the correct location and they delivery partners asking us to come to other bus stop or location to collect our parcel.  Eventhough I have mentioned clear address they are not able to find out the location.
Very bad service provide by swiggy no any customer care help and very rude answer given by riders very poor service
"Swiggy u really need to work on your delivery partners.You hire cheap labour and the customer has to bear the brunt.Your delivery boy Aftab Shaikh in Mumbai was uncouth and yelling over the phone on top of his voice.He was totally at fault by not following the instructions & he has the audacity to tell me to come and pick up my order from him.Seriously??After asking him to leave the order at the doorstep and not ring the bell, like a retard he keeps ringing the door bell and goes away without delivering the order and bloody lies that the order has been delivered on the app.Your customer service team didn't bother to call and escalate this matter and bcoz of your useless customer service support these ruthless, uncouth riders go scott free.Totally disgusted!!!!????"
Want to get a clarity on your delivery charges and tax calculation.  Not sure why you have such exorbitant amount attached with the order.  Will pick up food ourselves going forward.  Also need to circulate this to all and make people aware.
"Few Cheap employees, don't know how to behaive with customer, using services since 2014.  Have insulted me wasted my 6 hors in 4 days"
Swiggy is not a very good food servicing app but it's not bad here food is good and some places swiggy service is not good .
Worst customer support and service .  Don't order anything from swiggy.  They all are looters  Pls don't don't order from swiggy
I have ordered a food. Since iam already late for my dinner. And I orded my food the order was picked some one and cancel by him and I make to costomer care swiggy after only they processed my order. AT LAST I got my oder it cold and tastless????????????????????????????????????????

This is not a problem n he came n trying to beat me.. His name is debandra nath haldar .. I was totally afraid with this guy
My experience was very bad with Swiggy. They charged the food which was not delivered to me and ask me to provide negative feedback to the restaurant. Their customer support was not up to the mark. Recommend others not to use Swiggy.
"Worst service and delivery network, always late and rude delivery boys, request all to boycott them, better to stay hungry"
"Degraded choice of restaurants, exorbitant delivery charges, delayed deliveries. Customer support executives don't have clue many times and can't give exact updates. Restaurants don't respond to calls. Food quality is not good except at very few restaurants."
"I ordered food a 10 pm and delivery guy marked order delivered wihou deliverying  I complain abou his to swiggy cusomer support, didnt recieve heir reply for 1 hour and when I explained he issue, they said they need more time, I waited for 1 hour more and is 12:15 bow, no resoluion ye, swiggy and delivery guy boh no recieving call either, so is 12:15 and they kept me hanging, now i'll have so sleep empty somach and dont forgett the amoun of time wastted, energy wasted, headache  I request you all sop ordering from swiggy and uninstall app right now"
"I ordered babycorn n noodles. I got only babycorn, then i ordered noodles, but again i got babycorn. What d hell??. I wasted delivery ant.. u guys r sick. Never wil be bak to swiggy. Fcuk u guys."
Swiggy Mobile App WRITE REVIEW I just started online food delivery by swiggy app itself and my experience was not so good because of that I am going to stop order online food but after sometime I gave chance to other online food delivery services and found them satisfactory so I continue to other online food . Let's talk about the swiggy service it is very slow and the customer service is also very bad . Most of the time the food will be cold by reaching to the destination . And orders are changed many time like I ordered chicken tikka and it delivered chicken chilli .

Bhut hi beka service hai bhut late vi or costomer care to bss kux help krty nhi bss egnor krty hai or fir customer ka order dilevery hota hai ya nhi unko koi frk nhi pdta or call disconnect kr dete hai
I orders good and pain online after order. Waited 40 minits after order. After 45 min my order was cancelled automatically. I and my daughter waited for food . I called the. Customer care. They disconnected my call. Again I called and asked either diliver my food or refund the amount. Initially the customer care executive denied. After discussing more than one hour he agreed to repay only half amount.  Please don't order from Swiggy..they cheat customer. Don't repay .  Just make fool  Very very bad attitude  Very worst people and services  My review was refused and rejected . It says if you rate above 3 then only I will be able to submit my review
My order is not dileverd I m waiting 2 hours my order but after 2 hours is swiggy order my cancel...very very bad third class service...
Ordered food at 6pm and still no update. Foolish delivery partner and the software siwggy has is so deteriorated. You guys can please shut down and give chance to zomato.
I have ordered from many restaurants from my local areas..The restaurants actually told me order from them directly instead of ordering from swiggy.This happened because i raised a complained on swiggy on the low quantity im received from a hotel swiggy couldnt assist me.  Swiggy please take care about quality and quantity as well instead of just adding extra xharges.
"Basically it’s zero or negative rating, I would like to give. Ordered food at 9:00pm and at 10:00 pm delivery partner says he is from rapido and not swiggy. The careless customer service gave me an option for assigning a new delivery partner which would delay the delivery by another 1 hour. If you are incompetent why are you doing this business. Please do shut the business instead of giving fake promises"
"Swiggy is now started really cheat people , they charge way to much to delivery charges if its less than 1 km also .recently I ordered food from empire hotel and because of wrong mentioned addres I cancelled the order within a second and as per there policy they can charge one time for cancelation . but they charged me twice the amount and I was got irritated and chated to customer care but they are not aware by its deducted double the time after lot explaining also I have not got money back .  Really I was not expected with swiggy for this kind of response after this I am never gonna use swiggt app for sure ."
I ordered on 8:34 for jalebi n panipuri my children waited 1 hour and they slept how shame never use this site again ??
"This is my worst experience with swiggy, the order was 4 hours late and we even called the customer care thrice to cancel the order, and there was no initiative or resolution from their side. If the delivery agent had some issues, you should have assigned another boy. The delivery agent was making excuses, that police caught him, in reality, it was all fake. He was revolving around the same location. We don't understand how bad the service can get and how worst the customer care services will be"
"I keep ordering frequently from Swiggy. I experienced that I started getting different items than what I ordered. Initially I thought it was my mistake. But today I double checked before paying. Two of the items were different from what I ordered with same price. When I checked past order, the items listed are same what I ordered. This is strange. This has happened thrice."
Swiggy is one of the worst food delivery I ever faced. Not delivered food after 2Hours of wait time nor they have bothered to respond to my repeated calls. Customer care calls not connected and no gareentee for service. After accepting order while tracking delivery order it shows will be delivered in 11 minutes for hours. Most untrusted app.
Had a third worst experience with SWIGGY.  Lack in order management.  Rude delivery boy.  VERY VERY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT TEAM.
"I would like to inform you guys swiggy promises are fake. I ordered food on 12th april and the TAT was 35 mins or the food is free. The restaurant didn't bother to call and inform me about the unavailability of food. However, the delivery partner called and informed me about it. Thanks to him. I called the customer support team and the representative Mr. Rajkishore has informed that he can't do anything of it, except cancellation. I clearly mentioned him that I waited for 35 mins, talking to the rep was 20 mins and again the max i had to wait was 45 mins so to get deliver one food they legit made me wait for 1 hour 30 mins and it was around 11 :15 p.m. at night, I said all the restaurants will be closed but no action. Yesterday in afternoon I received a call from swiggy representative +91806175xxxx and he informed me about the gift hamper from the company. I said I won't be available at that time however can send today but when I raised a chat the representative Ali said that the company doesn't provide this kind of gesture. I wrote the mail also but no resolution. The customer support system is pathetic. They only have the cancellation policy of the unavailability of the food but they didn't bother to inform me."
I have had an extremely bad experience with swiggy. My last 3 orders have been delayed and cancelled. The delivery partner doesn't respond to customers on the chat option. The call centre is no good.. They provide standard template responses and there is no customer centricity in the way they deal with escalations.. Horrible service provider and as a customer we are forced to use this due to lack of options.. Will never recommend swiggy to anybody and at this rate the company is on its way to getting doomed. The rating I wanted to give is negative
"Order no 132676115913 - complete mess up. Money charged and then order cancelled. After lots of efforts, wrong order was sent. No refunds from swiggy. Bunch of cheaters and fraud company. Stay away. Zomato is much better."
"Swiggy does not take any responsibility when wrong/bad quality meat is delivered. Inspite of giving all detailed evidence, they made customer loose money. What's the point in ordering through this portal ? I paid a premium lrice and lost money. SWIGGY will fall down soon."
"I had placed na order for chicken popcorn and it was delayed by an hour and upon talking to an executive Mr. Amit Pikram, when asked for a compensation due to the constant same doing of Swiggy, he tells me that he's compensating me with Rs 40...such horrible behaviour of Swiggy...never ordering again"
Very bad service i asked for refund as the food was very baad and they didn't give the refund.  Don't order from here.
"When we order food from swiggy we pay various charges, the charge for food, packaging and delivery other than taxes. Now we are the customers of swiggy, right? They also say same when we give it 5 star rating, but when any problem occurs like food is not of good quality, or quantity is sent wrong the same swiggy customer support says that they dont have any responsibility for this. So why we are paying money to swiggy and trusting them that they will provide me the best food. This is what happened recently with me where I got burnt roti which I ordered from swiggy and they just didn't took any responsibility for it, they balmed everything to restaurant. Ultimately no resolution was given and I just understood that its my responsibility to choose good restaurant and its my risk for ordering food from swiggy otherwise for good food I need to go myslef and get the food."
Hi this is Shankar from tarnaka I was ordered a gongura chiken Biryani in Rayalavari Ruchulu hotel today 2 pm but till now time is 4 pm food is delivered till now . This is very worst delivery system
I ordered chicken drumstick 10 to 12 piece and boneless chicken with skin 1kg from swiggy naveen chicken center.  They delivered 4 chicken leg andchicken wings and also it has very bad smell. So immediately I took the photo and complained along with pictures. They asked me to throw it.and they will resolve the problem. But now they said its not comes under the swiggy standard.  So be careful to buy any items from swiggy. Better to choose Zomato or direct shops. You will get cheaper and also guaranteed items.
"My first time ordering on swiggy, and guess what, it gets cancelled, and i dont get any refund, and i am pretty sure delivery partner was drunk... Sad, very poor maintained."
Absolutely fantastic platform for online food ordering & delivery within estimate time..have a great deal with everytime to give better & best satisfaction..
"Worst service. if the delivery boy want to eat food, then they wont deliver the food and they wont pickup the calls too. simply said waited outside for 5-10 mins and we cancelled the order."
In swiggy instamart I ordered a tender coconut it's was really a worst purchase ?????? very bad please don't order in swiggy
"1) We had to order Chapatis from a restaurant nearby. Swiggy showed 30 min. delivery time. There should be some differentiation of time, based on what you are ordering. If the time you are showing for making and delivering just chapatis is the same as Butter chicken then it doesn't make any sense.  2) The order kept getting delayed. Had to call the restaurant first that it's just chapatis please send them early. In spite of that after 30 min. from ordering the delivery person started from the restaurant to deliver the order.  3) I have no idea what the delivery person was doing, he did not pick up the call even after calling 8 times and the order was finally delivered to me 1 hour and 20 min after ordering. The quality of chapatis from the restaurant was pathetic. They were not properly cooked, were thick and had a lot of maida mixed into aata(I had ordered tawa roti)  4) Before swiggy at least responded on customer care and even returned some money on account of poor quality food. This time I waited for 25 min for someone to start chatting on swiggy customer care and then had to hang up as no one was showing up. In the automated chat section, on telling that I had received bad food there was no reply other than we'll communicate to the restaurant. Before swiggy refunded some amount or gave vouchers in such cases.  5) their app doesn't show detailed reviews like zomato.  All in all, a very disappointing experience and this is becoming a new norm for swiggy."
Good company with worst employees. The employees are cheating this company Andy drowning the fame of the company very bad attitude towards proffesionalism never work over here
Once at mid night when I was very hungry I decided to order the food for me and after downloading the app form the playstore.  I wnet through the hotels list around me and immediately I came to know when I ooened the menu bar that price of the food items were up by around 25 percent on some items and more on some other items.  They also a charge a so called delivery fees which is purposely meant for the delivery but why they are trying to loot us.  I would recommend that it will be a lot better and price compitent if you could bring that by yourself and relying on it.
I like swiggy service but recently I used it and used lazypay in the payment options listed and since then it was a nightare though I paid they say I did not and no real customer service person to call and automated system keeps calling every hour  Even my friend s have similar experience  Please remove lazypay option from swiggy else u will be losing lot of customers
"Swiggy is handling the orders in a very worst way that either they are not delivering quality food or not delivering on time....  If u trust Swiggy u can starve for a whole day...  May be they can change their logo to ""Order Swiggy Stay Hungry""...  I would have given no star if there was a option"
"I received my food 2 hours after placing an order. Swiggy in between cancelled and made a replacement order without even informing. When asked for refund, they clearly refused and the food didn’t even look fresh.  Extremely poor service by Swiggy. Never ordering anything from Swiggy again."
They have hired bunch of stubborn people who don't even know how to access the google maps or even can speak in a polite manner...App deleted worst experience ever
One of the worst customers says. The driver says he will eat the food but won't deliver. The customer service care team didn't do anything. Shame on you guys. this is how you assist customers
When I placed my order in swiggy the bill amount along with discount was showing ₹250 but when order came they asked to pay ₹375.Even after commiting the mistake they added cancellation fee of so and so. Deeply disappointed with their careless behaviour. Restaurant-Bikkgane biriyani nit 5 sector 15 faridabad.
"I have ordered, very simply dish, masala dosa.  It took triple time to deliver as promised by swiggy.  This is very much disappointment for me for such a big delivery partner.  I will suggest all my follower and friend not to order any thing by swiggy."
I ordered my lunch from The Square Novotel Pune around 2 pm today. The food was suppose to be delivered by 3 but due to some load at the restaurant delivery person reached at 3:30 about which I was aware. But the delivered parcel was in a very pathetic manner. There were 2 mock tails with delivery which were spilling out and when I checked the food items that was also damaged  It occurred on: 19/03/2022  I simply asked them to refund my entire amount for the order which is Rs. 1348. But they are shamelessly offering me maximum refund of Rs. 600 and pressurising me to accept it.  Order Number: 130753842487
Swiggy genie is worst service. Don't ever use of it as they are not responsible for ur product if it is stolen or damaged. Many delivery boys are using fake a/c of swiggy. Swiggy know all the thing but they r not taking any action against them.
Ordered food and paid online  No food was delivered and no refund given despite more than 1 year asking for it.  Bad company bad policy bad customer service and support
I order food today 12 March 2022 from a nearby hotel. The hotel price is Rs.260 but when you order through swiggy it's priced at Rs.356.  Apart from the hotel item price swiggy is charging extra. I thought swiggy is only a delivery partner not a restaurant. This is really bad.
"Very bad experience for the past three orders. Paid money through online and delivered item as per their will and wish. More than half of the items are missing. And the executive says take it or throw in dustbin, irrespective of order this what will be given. Another instance delivered some other item than what was ordered. Friends be careful I even received the items opened."
"Swiggy has the worst service, it was worst experience 1st and last time I have used, don't use this service, they will only frustrat u"
Well he gives food at home and what is needed  Just one problem: In this deleveray charge and tax is expensive but most of the time 50 To 60 per cent off so it's cover
"Swiggy is really bad with finding locations i ordered many times but I never received without struggling on explaining the address and I always went to swiggy person , and in instamart they don't even refund"
Yeasterday i was order food from Urban in pune there was bye two get one offer at the time. I was ordered 2 dish for getting one more.  But at the time of delivery seen that only two dishes are delivered.  After the n I chat with swiggy to get it but no satisfaction was given to me. Even I called and spoken with the swiggy for the same then also no satisfaction in hand. They asked for screen shot of offer of the Restaurant. Same has been sent on Email which is given. Till no satisfaction.  Am very long time user of Swiggy and was very happy with their serving system.  But in future I want to think more about food delivery companies.

"Orders going via swiggy are not handled appropriately by swiggy.  I had made an order via swiggy but the delivered order was less than the order placed. pre payment done. when swiggy customer support was contacted and asked for refund for the order not delivered they said they cannot compensate but will inform the team. my money has been taken without giving me the ordered quantity. the chat with swiggy higher level executives also went for about a wee, but it was waste of time.  BEWARE WHEN YOU PLACE THE ORDER AND MAKE PREPAYMENT VIA SWIGGY."
"Ordered 3 veg loaded pizzas from Dominos but received pizzas which were missing cheese, vegetables and other toppings  Not properly baked food  Not expected such a low quality pizza's from a reputed restaurant like Dominos...  When I contacted customer care of Swiggy  Executive were ready to chat with me for 30-40 mns but were nt ready to speak on call"
I ve been ordering from swiiggy since it was launced but today was disappointed to the max  Ordered a casatta icecream from swiggy instamart got half eaten which is gross  I was refunded on time but still can't forget the worst  experience  This review is only for this one time bad experience
Have been ordering food from Swiggy and have found it decent but nowadays post adding tip column feel offended as a partner from Swiggy gets commission for delivering food and terms and conditions which he is ready to work . Even after not adding tip Swiggy sends message for adding tip to their fancy name of hunger saviour. Thats like a soft extortion to me and should not be allowed.
"In swiggy,  if we tell one delivery location, they are delivering the item in another location .  no proper customer service.  when we order two items, they are delivering only one item .  money is also, they are not refunding properly. worst customer service in swiggy ."
"I ordered breakfast on swiggy from udupi sannidi, I got cockroach on my food, I informed the same to swiggy customer service, but they not even gave partial refund for the order, I throwed entire food into the dustbin, atleast zomato is better than swiggy. Try to avoid ordering from swiggy, if you order from online you babe to wait for atleast 30 to 40 min to get the order delivered, I that time better go and have the food In your nearest hottel, if you got anything like this you can thoofed off the hottel manager and staff in front of everyone.  I hope everyone will understand my feedback towards swiggy services.  Regards  Sumanth"
"I ordered 6 donuts of Dunkin’ donuts and after offer I paid 416/- total amount. My order got delayed , Their delivery boy ate one of my donut the box was unpacked I ordered it someone else and they received it, it was all spoiled and two pieces of gems were lying in the box and when I shared my experience with Swiggy representatives ( 3 representatives) they told me they can compensate 10/- for the same. Means were they even serious for such experience they will compensate 10/-."
"Hi ,  Very bad experience with manish negi employee of swiggy,  .I am asking about the cancellation charges but he did not waived off the same they did not delivered the food we cannot pick from hotel.  At the end they take off our money they find a chance to get order cancel.  Please don't order from swiggy , of you did not picka call from delivery boy your order get cancelled and your money got waste.  My order I'd 128602000442"
"Delivery guy was unable to find the address and cancel the order and returned because it was prepaid.  19 Feb, I made an order(PAID)  ORDER NO: 128517820352  Today, I ordered food again and switched off my mobile phone. But, good thing is today he found the address and delivered the food without phone call. 21 Feb Today, I made another order of similar amount. CASH ON DELIVERY. I recovered my loss.  ORDER NO: 128518937448"
"I have been a Swiggy customer since 2012. I stay alone and order from outside a lot. There has been an incident today, not at all expected from the retail giant. I had ordered some snack items from 'Chai Days' but the retail "" giant"" failed to deliver. Why?  Because the delivery executive thought, "" Why shouldn't I have the food? It doesn't matter that it is someone's hard-earned money"". The customer is always at a loss because Swiggy doesn't employ 'discretion' when employing somebody to be a delivery executive. We pay the money for the food ( which we didn't even have) and also the cancellation fee as the executive decided to partake the food. This continues then simply one can switch to Zomato where such indiscretion never happened.  Also, the customer support executives keep on insisting that the payment reversal can happen only one time. It doesn't matter if that payment reversal happened two years back. Although the money comes from the customer's pocket, the support executives have full sympathy for the delivery executives. I just want to ask a question. How is Swiggy going to pay the salary of its employees if each customer decides to boycott, based on their less than ideal experience?"
"Email Vijaya.rakini@gmail.com  I have ordered 4 boxes from Karachi and sent it to an address if had a tag that I didn’t remove, however they Swiggy delivery guy removed the tag and took one of the boxes which is extremely not good. I really want to escalate this issue. How can someone be so vile. I want you to get back to me with an answer."
"I was a swiggy customer for a number of years now, but nowadays their service has been declined significantly and their cost is increased rapidly as well."
My food was overcooked and smells like pathetic and they didn't help me and I was very hungry I called them but they only say we are sorry thats not the way you are cheating with your coustomer
"Placed order at 9PM. Said order packed, will be delivered by 9.23PM. Initiated chat at 9.30PM, no update. Was transferred 7 times from ""Food Team"" to ""Instamart/Genie Team"", again and again and again, without any explanation. At one point I even asked the sixth guy, ""Would you transfer me again?"" No reply. Few seconds later same prewritten message that I am being transferred. I was on chat for 2 hours. It's very simple, if you don't have the sufficient infrastructure to handle a type of tasks, just don't add it as a feature. Even if you do, if an order doesn't go through or gets failed, it should be updated so a person can seek alternatives."
Swiggy persons hire stupids.and they won't deliver the food..  This is the 3 rd time as far as I remember.  Don't but any shares of swiggy..
Bad service. Delivery person never has proper change. And help centre doesn’t help much.  I’m very disappointed. They won’t give the whole food and won’t even refund
Worst app .and fake also they deduct it money and will not take ur order and make excuses..they will not refund ur money....
I have ordered dal khichdi..it was badly spoiled...having smell..  Very disgusting on swiggy's part..have not got full refund or food in return...i came home late from shoot n ordered something to eat...and this injustice has happened.  Won't ever go for swiggy
"I have experienced worst customer service from SWIGGY.  One of SWIGGY delivery refused to follow COVID protocols and argued with our Security person and got into physical fight. I sent a very detailed complaint to SWIGGY and all I got was "" We are looking into it"" response. I sent at least five reminders over a period of one month but got no response.  The worst part is - After a month, I got an automatic response that my complaint ticket is closed!  I have never seen any company closing a complaint ticket unilaterally without the complainant's knowledge and acceptance.  I will never order from SWIGGY now! Of course I do not think they care about it any ways."
"Thanks Swiggy and staff for your quality services.Keep it up.Best wishes.Me and family highly recommend your, trustworthy, convenient, efficient services to our known.Thanks for being there, specially in this time of pandemic crisis."
"Feb 2nd, the order was placed from Ratnadeep Supermarket. Swiggy genie delivery exec Mr. Riyazhussain sheikh charged me Rs.3010 & wanted me to transfer it to his Goole Pay a/c. But for safety reasons, I paid through Swiggy. 15 minutes later he called me to check the brand of apples that I want him to buy.  I realised that he took the payment from me even before the bill was generated by Ratnadeep. When questioned how he charged the amount without a bill, he replied that he made a rough estimate. I asked him to wait at the supermarket while I complain to Swiggy and cancel my order.  Swiggy, as we know, are not easily reachable & I had to keep typing on chat box receiving their standard replies of apologies, escalation of the complaint, asking me to send an email to their support team etc etc and finally closed the chat abruptly asking for my feedback.  All this chat wasted almost an hour with no outcome. Through google search, I got Swiggy's customer support number and called. The call got disconnected after playing a recorded msg that I do not have any active orders though my said order was still active and undelivered.  When I checked the status of my order in Swiggy app, it was marked as 'delivered' by Mr. Sheikh. I then had to resume the only communication channel provided by Swiggy - their rubbish 'chat box' which gave the same replies as in the previous chat.  Finally, spent many hours of my time gathering all details of the order & waiting to get a copy of the actual bill (paid by Mr. Sheikh) from Ratnadeep Supermarket.  To my surprise, Mr. Sheikh paid only Rs. 1812.99 but charged me Rs.3010 which was paid through Swiggy. Ratnadeep also confirmed that Mr. Sheikh had taken all the order items and left their premises. Disappointed and dejected with Swiggy's mean tactics, I sat typing the marathon episode once again in an email to the Swiggy support team and sent it at night for which I got an auto-reply stating that I should wait for 24 to 48 hrs for them to get back after investigating.  It is past 72 hrs since the order was placed on 2nd Feb (today is the 5th of Feb) and there has been no resolve from Swiggy and not even a courtesy call to inform the status.  After 48hrs the support team had sent another email (in response to my reminder) to me stating the same that I should wait for another 24 to 48 hrs for a resolve!  What do we understand from all this?  Is Swiggy encouraging its employees to pursue such frauds or is it innocent?  Mr. Sheikh claims that the money goes to Swiggy and he has no share in it since it was paid to Swiggy. Finally, as I see it, Mr. Sheikh got items worth Rs. 1812 and Swiggy got the balance of Rs. 1198 from the money that I paid of Rs. 3010.  Why would they want it to be resolved?  Hope Swiggy understands the fact that customer satisfaction and the support extended to their issues alone bring back the glory that Swiggy enjoyed at one time. Else, it is just a matter of time before such fraudulent practices and avoiding tactics of Swiggy paves its own way to see the end!  Please refer to the uploaded pics."
On 29 jan i placed order at 9.35 pm and at 11:30 pm I'm still waiting for my order... After I approach customer care the executive telling ur can't be delivered...  Friend I suggestion pls u zomato don't use swiggy... They are fraud people
I have ordered a cake from supreme bakers trivandrum on 24th December 2021 at 6.14pm ( order number: 1045897956549) and paid the bill by myself and later booked a pick and drop from genie. The order was seen to be delivered. It was send to a family friend and they told us that the cake was brought to their home and the delivery boy asked them for the payment. And since they refused to make the payment the delivery boy took the cake back.  I had a phone conversation with the delivery boy while he was at the bakery and I clearly mentioned it to him that i had already made the payment. Even then he asked for the payment at the drop address.  Right now there is no information about my order. It hasn't reached back to the bakery or my friend received it. The delivery boy didn't inform me about the issue and I wasn't informed that the cake was taken back. When I contacted the bakery they said that they didn't receive the cake back. I am not able to contact the delivery boy.  I have already emailed them(swiggy) several times raising my concerns but they are not taking things seriously. They are asking for proof see how can a person provide proof if they didn't receive the order.  The response from the swiggy team was very much irresponsible. I even emailed in detail about having a phone conversation but they didn't even made a call. Ever since I was asking for refunding my money there has not been any response regarding the refund.
Swiggy delivery getting worst.  Even customer care representative have no clue. What to do.  So helpless.
"Hopeless service by swiggy, they don't know how to behave with customers. Bad services. Even kfc people know how to deliver the order. These people don't know how to deliver the order"
"Highly disappointed with the services provided.  Executive calling n sayin that he is working for zomato instead of swiggy, is I a joke or wat???  N number of times I had faced the issues here.  only executive keep on changing to retain their customer"
The delivery boy is fraud ...he told bick problem after cancelltion he called me and asking money worst delivery partner you should terminate that fellow
Sir me indore se bat krra hu yha Fm. Call msg ka reply ni krte h or meri id company se band ho gyi h  Google form bharne pr call par kahte h ki apne beg tshirt ki pic ni di .. jab ki me deta hu par temprery bloke hui thi id order delay k karan but ab permanently band kr di h meri id on kese hogi
"I had ordered and got items delivered which is completely different from my order. Our package has been delivered to another person and his to us. My family don't know what I ordered and when I checked with them later what they got I came to know of this. I informed about it to customer service and their simple response was as you have no image of food we can't pay any compensation or any action. I clearly told them I don't need compensation but an acceptance that it was a mistake from your side they are so adamant to do that and told me to take a photo in future of what we receive. The restaurant person contacted me and said the other customer had contacted them about wrong delivery. She also told us the delivery person was informed well about different package and numbers written on them. So, it is casual approach of the delivery person but Swiggy never bothers to accept that. Looks like Zomato is somewhat better but to be safe go for local restaurants."
Unke delivery partner khana khaa jate hain aur order pahuchaye Bina cancel kerke customers pe penalty lagwa dete hain ki customer ne phone nhi uthaya aur khud khaa jaate hain
"I ordered food from Subway, Swiggy person could not understand the address. Out of the 3 items only 2 delivered. There is no response from customer support. No refund also. Worst app and worst service. I unstalled the app."
WORST WEBSITE. EVERYTIME ORDER ISSUE. WRONG THINGS MENTIONED ON APP. NO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. ZOMATO MUCHMUCH BETTER. Plz unistall this app and use only zomato
Swiggy is been consistent in pathetic services. Numerous times orders placed by me and after waiting for an hour the response from the team is sorry for the inconvenience as either the order not acknowledged or the delivery partner not in time or not available.  After giving enough chances I decide to stop ordering
Order not delivered still they want to blame it on the customer dont want to accept their mistakes and want to make the customer pay for it
Swiggy service is the worst . I felt very bad about their services today. Even after complaining they don't take any action and same issue is repeated many times .
Order never delivered without going to the home address or calling the no mentioned in the address. And the customer support never gave an appropriate reply after sending several emails. Very unprofessional.
"Swiggy doesn't ever fail to surprise when it comes to their customer service. I stopped ordering food on their app recently and use it on and off only to pickup stuff using swiggy genie. Never had a problem with the genie staff until today's incident. I placed the order for q pick up at 9.45am, and the delivery person was assigned 10mins later. He called me at 10.01 saying there is a very long queue at the store and it will take 45mins, and that I should cancel the order and will get a refund on my delivery fee. I used th cancel order option under Help cos there is never an easy way to do this on the swiggy app. This takes you to customer support and I told them exactly what happened, they place me on hold and come back after 2mins telling me exactly what I told them in the first place and ask me to cancel the order. Now I am confused...isn't that what I contacted you for?? The rep then says support team is working on the resolution, then I get a call from another guy called vikash and he quotes swiggy policy and all and that I will get a refund of Rs.12 out of 32 cos the delivery partner can wait at the location only for 15mins. I can't start explaining the level of argument he indulged in and that forced me to tell him to keep the Rs.32 as lose change that will fill the swiggy coffers. So in effect that is no resolution. I hang up and wait for the partial refund. Shortly after I get a call from him again and he is sorry now and has assigned another delivery guy to pick the order. This new person calls me at 10.22 ready to pick the order. Mind you..it took all of 20mins from the time the first one said it will take 45 mins to the time the second delivery guy reached the place. Who is to blame here, the partners, the customer support, resolution team or the culture of not helping people that swiggy has built?"
I have ordered food and we were waiting for the food to be delivered. We didnt receive the parcel and got the status as delivered I was immediately asking for help in the chat but that was not responding. The immediate next day I wrote a mail to swiggy they were like not replying why this has happened but still were in reverse were very rude in replying that my amount will not be refunded. worst app
"Swiggy one is one of the bad plan and more ever the support is very bad then that. Food will get on time but not our problems. I order 2 dish and lm regular customer for that restaurant so i know what quantity they will give but this time i got less.l raised complaint but the swiggy rep tried to convince with will report this with restaurant and it will not repeat in futurn. Use lesss. Coming to swiggy one , giving 300 is charity. You get only few restaurants free delivery and few coupons that also less."
"Pathetic service and poor management, team misbehaviour and harrasment by deliver executive , poor application"
Very bad. Yesterday I orderd but food was not as ordered. No quantity no quality and price too much. Talk to costomer care but no refund. This app is totally fraud. Are aap restorent me baith ke order karte he to adha ghanta lagta he ye fresh food itne kam time me kaise delivered karte he. Bahut bada golmal he. please remove this and pick from restaurant urself. Aap aginst me comment Karo to sabmit nai hoto. Chor he sab
"Worst application.. dont waste time.. they will take premium fee of 400 rs and after that they will close delivery from your account.. never order food .. and there back office service is really pathetic.. they all will say you same line ""this will not repeat again"" and then too no solution for your any complaint."
Worst experience I face immediately I cancelled my order...but they didn't given the food which I ordered and they refused to refund amount Rupees 734..
"Never ever use Swiggy. Pathetic company and pathetic arrogant restaurants. Swiggy does not have any control whatsoever on their restaurants. Had many bad experiences most of the times i used it. Orders don't reach the restaurant and you are kept waiting. On calling restaurant, they ask you arrogantly to call only swiggy. Items may go unavailable anytime even after placing of orders. Refund don't come automatically. Once I was asked by their customer care executive to submit form for refund of my own money!! The wait timer on their app moves as per it's own algorithm like for 1 minute when your IST wall clock has actually moved more than 10 minutes !! I would give it zero stars but that option is not there."
Swiggy doesn't even take the ownership to check if the order is delivered to customer or not. They easily wash off their hands by saying hotel and delivery boy is not responding to calls and you need to end up waiting for ever. I had to wait for one and half hours for the order which never got delivered and the contract centre executive Sreejit doesn't even have a clue what is happening. Horrible service. These guys don't take any ownership not take any action against defaulter hotel or deliver partners. We as customers have to just keep waiting.
Swiggy is delivering orders on time and best thing is that delivery guy was very polite. Thanks to Swiggy.
I ordered kfc from swiggy. But they dont deliver and not ready to cancel my money. This same issue happeing thousands of people. But no one gi Court. They stop order through this bloody fraud company. Dont go and buy from swiggy. They are cheating people. And their service very bad. Any one can help me retuen my money from this fraud people???
I have order meal at 10 PM on 31st dec 21. I have received my meal after 12. I got call from Swiggy staff to convince to late deliver my order and i accept as per rush. They deliver my meal bute they charged twice. It is more than week i did nit get my refund back and now they stop replying such hide their mistake. Is swiggy real? Are they scam? Such ridiculous service
"Today I ordered some snacks from Amma’s pasteries, Vadavalli through Swiggy by 03.40pm.  After ~10mins, I got notified that the order is picked up by the Swiggy Delivery Partner named Staniley Premkumar (804581xxxx).  But there were no updates on the tracker (Swiggy app) from the Delivery partner.  After waiting for ~45mins, I called him several times but calls were not answered.  Later got the message that the Order is delivered by 4.46pm  So I used the option “Order not delivered” and then called to the Customer care.  Then I explained the problem and the refund was initiated.  This is inform that even Delivery partners cheat and mark the order as delivered without delivering.  Request all to be cautious with the Supplier (Amma’s pasteries), Delivery Partners (Swiggy), Delivery boy (Staniley Premkumar). Especially Staniley Premkumar."
Swiggy shows you all the quality and 5 star rating restaurants where we can enjoy our meal with super satisfaction.The app is user freindly which can be used by anyone .The delivery executive and staff is ultimate
"I trusted Swiggy like Amazon and Flipkart and generally pay them advance for orders. I placed an order with KFC through Swiggy on 31st Dec. 2021. It was cancelled and refund initiated that stated the amount will reflect in my account in 3-4 days, till now it was fine. I was hungry so placed another order with Barbeque Nation amounting approx. Rs 800/-. After 15 min., I received a call from Swiggy representative conveyed that there are more than 50 riders are standing outside restaurant so what to do ? I asked him I can wait for my order. Thenafter 15-20 min as I opened app to check the status of order. I was stunned it was showing that order was cancelled and a message appearing that no amount will be refunded. I LOST MY MONEY AND STAYED HUNGRY ALL NIGHT. Swiggy looting money and while contacted they say to customers that customer cancelled the order and as per policy we have right to take all the money and no food will be delivered. This was my experience with Swiggy. I have screenshot of chat anybody wants it to believe that can be shared.  I am writing it for their customers awareness on all social media platforms and thinking to approach consumer court later."
Ghatiya hai swiggy is sait pr kbhi order na kare koi contact support bhi nhi hai pesa lootte hai bc sale bhen..... De
I placed order they received it after waiting half hour. They called me with an excuse of bike problem and asked delay in for delivery I agreed. After some time they called again and asked me to cancel the order but I refused and ask for delivery they said ok for delivery but they cancelled order. N remained hungry for night
"Swiggy is a big fraud, they accept the order take the money but don't deliver the food and their delivery executives are marking the orders as delivered without even attempting it.  It is happening regularly.  So, Think twice before ordering food from swiggy."
Very bad experience with swiggy they are cheating with customers don't go trow from swiggy only making money
"I ordered food with swiggy, food was not delivered but I get a msg food delivered  Upon checking with cs they connected to delivery boy but delivery boy has not even reached my place where I was tracking his vehicle. When enquired about the order delivery he started all slang languages.The superior denied to deliver the food as a re order  Highly unprofessional. Please think before placing the order."
Vegetarians don't ever order on swiggy they marked non veg items as veg items with green symbol .government should ban swiggy  Place:neyveli swiggy menu
Ordered food for my mother on the Christmas night in swiggy application. I usually get ordered delivered . Even yesterday I got grocery supplies through swiggy. My mobile number wasn’t working . So I tried to contact the delivery executive but the system could not connect several times. So I text for help and gave alternative numbers so that they can contact me. There was no response to my chats and suddenly I observed my order got cancelled from their side. I have given full address then I failed to understand the reason tor failure of delivery . Again no one bothered to act on my messages . When I found there is full cancellation fee charged . I tried to interact charged and I observed they closed my chat . I could contact them on chat through where is my ruder which was not answered . After exchanging several messages another person came online and chatted and promised a call back in 15 mins . I again gave the alternate number. But more than an hour has passed there has been no effort to contact me . My mother from whom I ordered food on a Christmas night waited for food till 11.30 pm. I paid advance money and that’s become a problem . I realised their customer service is pathetic . Their systems do not function . This is a criminal offence taking money fir a service or delivery which they failed to complete. They are harassing customers like this. They failed to resolve my case .
Today i have ordered paneer tikka which was 1st prepared wrong by Kanhaiya veg and after repreparation it was ordered to someother customer. I have ordered this order on my friend phone. These ppl lack accuracy and what a waste of my two hours.
The rating should not even be one....worst service...the customer service people do not know anything...robotic templates...Non sense service and non sense people
"So, I want to order from the nearby place which is less then 1km (0.7 and 1km) in the Google maps. But for every restaurant the delivery fee varies.  I read in an article, that swiggy charges 29INR for first 2 km but while ordering, whole scenario changed.  Also, for the same restaurants- delivery charges differs on weekends and weekdays.  This is insane. I felt cheated."
"Half the orders placed on Swiggy do not get delivered.  I place most of my orders on Sundays and I no matter which restaurant I order from, there will always be 1 missing item. Of course Dominos, McDonalds are an exception, but the rest of the restaurants do this in Bangalore. Customer service of Swiggy is also so annoying that they don't do anything about it except say - we apologize. We will take your feedback. Almost all their agents have the same line. It is as if they have a script for the entire unit and those fellows keep copy pasting the lines in reply to your issue and don't bother to type out a response. Ridiculous service by the restaurants listed on Swiggy and the same with their customer support.  I have switched to Zomato for now. Hope that's better."
"Instamart Store Club Florence Sector-56 store manger Rishab, mohan, Aman, Himanshu make froud order ask another person and send sigrate, dry fruits etc item .And sell another place for earn money .Looder ask manger then manger out from store .Club Florance basment 15 Box furtine Oil distribute Aman , Himanshu, mohan, Rishab to ask Looder divide 4 part .Milk and other item are parcel to another person take money ."
"The company started well. Then the service was very bad. Thy do not have control over their delivery partner. In one instance delivery partner was under influence of alcohol and picked up item and never came to deliver. In another instance the restaurant partners do not prepare swiggy orders as they are not at all bothered for swiggy orders. swiggy eats up about 23/24% of their sell price. Swiggy customer care can not reach the restaurants not can reach the deliver personnel. The service has gone really down. In This scenario, I believe, I would have really imporoved the standard with drastic measures or would have thought of closing it. Please, think!"
"From time to time they don't deliver, and the cancellation policy is so pathetic. Even after sharing my live location their unable to deliver ."
I have ordered the food online from zyka restaurant. I have paid the payment online.I had shared my live location of the hotel . The delivery boy was totally drunken. When we were calling him he was not receiving our call. and when we the call was connected he was taking rubbish. He was totally mental. His behaviour was Ill mannered. He leave the delivery on another hotel. he was totally mental. When he comes to our hotel location the food was totally spoiled. The food was frozen. When I called to Swiggy customer care center then they were offering a coupon of rs 100 . Our order price was approximately 200 rupees. Tell me the thing what will we do of their coupon when we are in need of food at this time. Very bad experience Swiggy. You must either refund our money or you have to deliver hot food for us but you don't do anything. Really disappointing Swiggy. I will never ever use the swiggy .
"Five months ago, I have ordered a simple Dal and Rice from Swiggy. They, not only, give me the delivery on time; but also, their quality if food is also great.  Recently too, I have ordered Noodles yesterday only. They given the order on time and exact on given location and also the quality of food is good.  The fact is when a hunger person is ordering something. They are actually depending on 2 factors : Quality of food and Ontime.  If they fulfilled this too, then the customer is happy, like me."
I am happy with this because I got the delivery always in time and I always follow the rating while ordering the food for which I get the best food .but now a days there is no coupon code for discount option and the price was also too high for which I am unhappy
I have ordered in swiggy and as address was different cancelled my order within 5mins.They have charged my complete order amount as cancellation charges. Very worst app.
"I am a delevery boy in my location. i have only getting 20ruppees to 5kms. in rain, customers paying more than 40ruppees, we have only getting 15 ruppees."
I was ordered food from swiigy but not received till 2 hours.....very bad service...they don't care for customer
"I have been waiting for so long for my order from swiggy..But, they have delivered a wrong order to me..  Worst service from Swiggy.. very irresponsible staff.."
They will give u the timeline of delivering of your order but never deliver on time  Give the same answer evry time don't worry u r order will deliver on time
Swiggy delivery is very bad. And too late for delivery and one more thing if am order the item taken by another delivery boy and some times items also missing.And also charge’s are very expensive
"I ordered Swiggy genie to collect birthday cake from Labonel. The item was intact before pickup but damaged in the delivery handling process. Unfortunately Swiggy help was helpless and could only share feedback. They as well stated disclaimer (that’s neither available nor accepted during ordering process), customers are responsible for fragile and high valued food items if they are damaged during delivery process. Ignore the compensation or refund, they didn’t take responsibility or owned for damage caused monetary and emotionally. There was no insurance to consider. There is no assurance by this way and could trust Swiggy genie any further. I’m extremely disappointed with spoiled birthday preparations and extremely disappointed with Swiggygenie pushing back the damage caused. If there is a process set, it will be highly appreciated atleast if the responsibility and ownership remains with Swiggygenie rather than stating that it’s customers responsibility while we are ordering. We ordered trusting Swiggygenie but not delivery partner, a complete unknown delivery partner."
Sector 62 rolls king chor and same for Swiggy…Thank you for your pathetic service…I ordered 2 items but received only one item and I have paid the full amount for both items and now they are not able to refund my money…bekhari….
"I have been using swiggy mostly since the pandemic started. However they never deliver on time. I cannot remember how many times they have delayed my orders( few minutes one can let go but 1 hour plus delay is unacceptable). Today I lost my patience as they took 2 hours to deliver my order. On top of that when the delivery person arrived, he was rudeAF. Customer service is useless and it is just robots sitting and giving standard replies. My order value was around Rs.800 and they offered me Rs.241 refund?.I thought they were joking. I doubt I will ever order from swiggy again."
"One of the worst service they steal money from people, I ordered cakes for father buy two get one free. They sent all damaged cakes, they replicated the order with only two cakes when I returned the order. Sick bloody ate of third cake and the agent never informed that she is sending only 2 cakes not three they bloody cheat people."
Very disappointed with the seiggy delivery guy. I ordered food as I was very hungry. Delivery guy told me to come down across the road as he can't park his bike . He was very rude as am old lady I can't come down or cross the road .after hearing thT he sreamed misbehaved with me  I did not eat as I was so hurt and humiliated.  Never ever order from swiggy again
"Swiggy took my money and lied to me.  Swiggy promised free delivery if I bought their plan called ""Swiggy Super Binge"". So I bought their ""Swiggy Super Binge"" plan, but now I am paying again for delivery because they decided to not honor the plan I paid for.  That is stealing. Swiggy steals money from people."
Rated 1 because of support on Order #121537875767. Order was received after 90 minutes of ordering and all support person did was was replying with pre written templates. Chatting with a bot is more sensible rather than chatting with a person acting like a bot. Switching to Zomato and hoping for better experience there.
Wrost delivery part of thies comeny and not well time for give me the delivery. And wrost app. Food quality is wrost
I have cancelled my order just because my adress was wrong they have charged 100% cancellation charge
"Had the worst experience with Swiggy. Placed an order with at 8:20, it was supposed to take 40 minutes to deliver. Called the delivery partner at 9, he said his bike had malfunctioned. From then till 10:30, spoke with customer care executives, who promised that the food will get delivered in 10 minutes, but nothing happened. Finally called the restaurant, they said the order had been handed over to the first delivery partner. All Swiggy did was apologize and refund the money. Have lost faith."
"Shame on you guys, , , a 1st class cheater, you guys have withdrawn the package after getting millions of rupees subscription from the customers, ,  Posted the below in all the platform, , will procceed further till you guys come out with a solution for the customer who purchased the package..food cheaters yo the core...  , I purchased MY super bite member ship 250rs plus from Swiggy 3 weeks before which has 30 free delivery and 30 buy1 and get 1 offer by using Bogo code in few selected restaurant which will be visible in our app and I also used this facility for few times, refer the attached screenshot.. Now when I try to purchase again the buy 1 get 1 offer the app is not showing up any restaurants , so I contacted swiggy so called customer chat which was really useless and wate of time.. They have their own idiotic automated answers from Every questions... They keep swapping my chat with different people who has no answer for questions, after reinstalling my app , my package still shows as valid to 31/1/2022. But swiggy says I need to get some other package which they have introduced now by spending 253rs again., , , my question is whr is my package which I got, why I can't use this package even after I purchase it my hard earned money... Why these companies are cheating their customers by getting the money.... Really pathetic and frustrated to handle these of issues through their chat...#swiggy #swiggyindia #swiggydelivery #chennaifoodguide #foodie #chennaifoodscene #chennaifoodie"
Ordered from McDonald's kadakpada kalyan west at 1300hrs at 1500hrs unit manager says order is delivered but delivery personnel denies. How and who to complain.
"Worst experience with Swiggy, bad Delivery and IT team .. wrong locations recorded, stubbornnesses of delivery agents … they will spoil you evening don’t try to order from them …. BEWARE… mine is spoiled ."
"If u order by swiggy, and there is merchant or driver fault , they do not do anything, neither u get the food, and the refund also takes 5-7 days. happened with me twice. as customer the service is terrible and would not recommend anyone ."
"Fassos chandigarh delivered poisonous wrap to me through swiggy . My entire mouth got bitter for 30 minutes after taking a bite from paneer roll. When I talked to their chandigarh kitchen head Ashish we totally ran from his responsibility and told me to replace order. When I asked about managment and staff detail who prepared my order he refused to give any details. I am going to submit poisonous food to food and drugs agency for further investigation and going to launch police complaint against swiggy, Fasoos and chandigarh kitchen head Ashish .kindly, don't trust these online food delivery companies as they are just playing with customer health without having any check on their food partners and blaming each other for serving poisonous food to customers.instead of investigation swiggy employee I am frustrated and providing 128 rs is the best she can do."
"Its really rude and unprofessional these days. Never delivers orders on time! M pissed with the rude behaviour in its service! In place of serving a penalty for constantly delivering late orders, they are putting a penalty on me when i told to cancel my order as it was late again!  Would never recommend now to anyone!"
"My experience with the service of Swiggy company is very bad. I ordered dosa at 8:00 pm. But the company could not complete my order till 10:00. When I called their marketing team, they did not respond for half an hour. When I canceled my order in anger, the company deducted the cancellation charge. Marketing team of Swiggy company is very bad. It does not cooperate with the customers at all. Therefore, if you ever want to order food from Swiggy, then you should get it done cash on delivery.Their website is good and you can easily order food in it."
You guys do not have a sense of emergency why we order. You just know how to make profit. Order was given 2 hrs back and ur delivery guy ran away with it...... I get a call after bloody 2 hrs that the order needs to be replaced..... One of the crappiest moment anyone can come across when guest is at home ...... Kindly shut ur services down of u don't know how to fullfill an order also.... Sorry to say but u suck big time.
"With rise in food business and app based communication few small companies like Swiggy thinks that it is fine if once or twice customer complaints can be ignored, we will keep growing.  If your marketing team is good with bad customer support your survival will become a challenge.  Coming back to recent incident.  I used their service Swiggy Genie trusting the brand, the delivery boy Dev Kishore Yadav came to pick dry fruit boxes which I sent to my sister who stays 6kms.  I sent two boxes, but she received one, I immediately called delivery boy and he said someone on the way stole the box and he did not report to anyone.  He uploaded the correct pictures to the order, before delivery 2 boxes are visible and after delivery 1 box.  I reported to Swiggy and they took 4 days to investigate.  After 4 days, the customer support team said, order was successfully delivered.  Even if they have proof, this is the condition.  Now, the matter isn't close from my end, I will make sure to share story with as many people as possible cz more then money its about ethics of company."
This app was so good delivery persons sharp time delivery the food and the customer service very nice this perfect food delivery app.
"Zomato is way better than swiggy.  I used to prefer swiggy because of its low prices and same food but over the time I realised that it makes fool of us. After few succerssful orders, it plays a game, saying that you didnot pick our calls so we ought to cancel your order without any refunds.  No calls or messages are recieved, even delivery executive is made not reachable."
Very nice and tasty food to say here Kahna restaurant dahod ke staff service is good I'm always comeing
"See how Swiggy operates. I ordered a mosquito bat from Swiggy. It's battery wasn't working. I complained but Swiggy is just refusing to provide refund or replacement. People, I urge you to learn from this horrible experience and don't order anything from them."
Very poor management of system or employees and his business partner in bettiah city.  Taste is also very bad
"Worst app, delivered wrong items! No chance of refunding the money. Better buy via CoD. At least that way you have your money."
Highly disappointed with their disgusting services. Rather than providing ETA they better start robbing people on gunpoint. Extremely hopeless!
I ordered dinner for my family and guests visiting us around 9p.m. was told I could expect delivery in 30 mins. I expected to serve my guests by 10 latest. However around 9:45 was informed of another 30 min delay due to food still being prepared. On calling the restaurant I was informed the food is ready and awaiting a swiggy agent to collect the same from the security where it was kept. It took swiggy 2.5 hrs to get to me regarding the food. Which in the end was collected by myself in a downpour. After waiting for over 1.5hrs for the food. I got a terrible customer rep names pinku who wasn't able to assist in any way shape or form to add insult to injury cuts off my call on asking to speak with a manager. Morale of the story pay on delivery
"Worst service support, ordered something and support I form uploaded images are not valid.  Worst experience"
The delivery guys says he is being directed to a different address - support says delivery guy is unable to reach you. and while I am chatting with them for the last 60 mins they cancel my order and don't refund my money coz delivery partner could not reach us.  I don't understand how their bad mapping and their incompetent delivery people and support are my mistakes. If anything my mistake is choosing swiggy.
"We paid full payment, they didnt call and deliver food too, they cancelled order and taken full cancellation charges. worst ban swiggy i dont want to refer anyone to order through swiggy@swiggy"
"I have ordered dinner as a gift for someone . Delivery boy asked for extra money to that person to deliver the order . When he denies, he called me ask me to pay extra money. This was so unethical. I ordered at 7:45pm and at 10:00pm swiggy canceled my order. And they simply said sorry for inconvenience. No efforts put to deliver the order. No one cooperates from swiggy . I will strongly recommend , not to use this application to order the food unless you are planning to donate some money. Because food you order will not be delivered."
Swiggy has stolen Rs200 for a undelivered food on my card. It’s a worst begging bowl app and they are all beggars. I removed the app and never use it.
I ordered through swiggy instamart before 9 pm and my food is coming at midnight. This is so unsafe and unprofessional. I also paid extra for instant delivery since I am a girl and I feel unsafe with late deliveries. I requested to swiggy but no one could help. Swiggy kept on transferring my chats to 10 different people for over 3 hours. They don’t even compensate for their mistake and only says sorry. This is the worst experience I ever had. Swiggy is just getting worse.  I bet their senior management would not do anything about it.
"I placed an order at 8.41 pm it has bee more than 3 he's its not delivered, after two hours customer service told me cancel that order and place a new once. Every 15 mins they are telling they will assign delivery. Partner but it was assigned. Wallet no. Was also unregistered in swiggy app. I tried too many times no. was showing invalid. This was done on support chat, name Abhishek Verna very I'll behavior and fooling their client. I tried asking him for delivery boy no. He didnt gave."
"This thread is write about the worst customer experience and the embarrassment caused by this APP. I ordered food at 8.30 for me and my guest, as the food was still showing in transit and it was 11.15 night I seeked help from support and the solution that they gave is cancel the order. There was no attempt to make alternate arrangement even though the restaurant was still open. This was so embarrassing for me in front of my guest. We have to spend night virtually hungry. Swiggy is epitome of dishonesty, unprofessionalism, bad support, lack of empathy. It is a case study of how an organisation shouldn't be."
Swiggy is fraud company they are doing fraud with pakka profile They hire me and i work for one month when i asked for my salary they removed me from group they using innocent people they have not paid a single rupee to me they have used me they have mentally harrassed me.. they are doing fraud with there employees #swiggy haye haye #pakka profile haye haye
Swiggy is a big blunder. I have received chicken order instead of veg and when complained to customer care they have replaced only one item instead of two and simply denied another once stating the other food item was any which ways free under binge plan. Never go for swiggy plans and order only from brand food chains.
"Very disappointed to say Swiggy is not reliable - if you are arranging a small get-together and totally relying on swiggy instamart to deliver the Meat and groceries.  The order no is 129055848708  I have made an order in which the money got deducted, I have been waiting for more than 40 minutes for things to get delivered.  No message or not even a single update, so I had to check the order but the sad part is the order has Not been taken itself, I assumed that the money has been deducted so I may get the order anytime.  After all, when I try reaching support for a callback, they denied it more than 10 times, and the issue wasn't resolved, the support team is so pathetic and least concerned about the customers.  Thank you for ruining my weekend with your pathetic service."
You can call to swiggy Fraud Father and the staff is Frauds Fathers childrens.  They are dakait on the pockets of public and looted to everyone.
Missing and incomplete items sent.not giving refund back for there mistake.no proper response for the team.
"Sad to say Swiggy is not reliable - if you are arranging a small get together and and totally relying on swiggy to deliver the food - be careful  I always have a bad experience when I  We ordered 11 packs of food and after one hour they delivered only 1 pack  we ordered 7 large pizzas, and they were all soggy while they reached us  We ordered food for 2 in late evening, and till mid night we were getting notifications that the person is on the way to our home  they may not deliver in time, the food may not be presentable, the quantity may not be correct  I am writing this review, due to multiple bad experiences  It was very difficult situation  ""do roti ke liye itna wait karne se achha hai, restaurant mein khud ja khe kha lo""  am uninstalling your application - will never order again  Sanjay Shah  +917698001495"
In my last week payment they have taken for payout adjustments 4000 as they will take service charge of 30% from consumer and they deduct like payout adjustments of 3000 and 4000 from our payments means how can we give salary to staff an day the rent and bring the ration we are investing for all goods only these swiggy and some other company's are tieng up as partner with hotel for food delivery that's it they are not a partners of our business.
"I ordered to eat from Sweety. Swiggy was not giving the option of cash on delivery, was asking to make online payment. Their customer care support is also not working properly.  These people promise to come on time but make them late on the pretext of traffic."
"Swiggy Delivery boys never have the change they owe customers upon payment. Initially I thought this was a geniune issue but over a period of time I've noticed a pattern. If the order is small the payback change is almost always 20-30 bucks short, if the order is large the payback change will be as high as 50-60bucks short. I sometimes pardon the change they don't have as tip and let them go but after the exorbitant delivery charge Swiggy levies this kind of scamming to extract tips is unacceptable!"
Why swiggy continuously cut 400 rupees on the name of security deposit from delivery boy..what is this ?
"I had a package delivered from Jalahalli to Hulimavu through Swiggy Genie in Bangalore. The item was delivered to someone on the street in the wrong address, with absolutely no confirmation of identity, according to the words of the delivery boy.  I have tried to contact the customer care through umpteen platforms, but nobody has responded. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE."
At the joining time they not told me about security deposit and now they dectuct 1000 rs from my earning shame on you swiggy refund my 1000 rs
"I had made an order at 9.06 pm for my guest, but till 10.30 p.m did not get the delivery. Then I raised a complain with swiggy and they told be to wait for 15 mins.  I called the delivery valet and he informed that he has just recd the order and will take 45 mins.  This dumbo app wanted me to take the food after two hours of order.  On raising a complain , the unskilled executive just kept on saying sorry but failed miserably to address my concern on the company service policy.  Swiggy is just concerned with their commision.  Guys don't use this"
"This is the 3rd time it has happened. If you order from Swiggy on weekends, you order receive a short order or you receive a wrong orde. Invariably you receive it very late. We ordered last and the delay left the kids crying. We placed 2 more orders from another app after this order and they got delivered but this needed followups, tweets and phonecalls to get it delivered in more than one hour. Hopeless service."
Received food from sri krishna pure veg restaurant at powai. Paneer tikka was pathetic burnt gravy and veggies. Paneer was like chewing gum. Had ordered butter roti with paneer tikka and also hara bara kabab. Received call from swiggy delivery boy when he was at restaurant. He said butter roti is not there sending chapati we said should have said before confirming he said talk to restaurant guy we somehow agreed. After delivery we did not find hara bara kabab in parcel. By then number and rating page was gone. With great difficulty found chat option and got number of delivery boy. Called him he says what can I do as he HAD made me speak to restaurant guy directly. I said restaurant guy spoke only of rotis and did not mention hara bara kabab and you yourself were present there you heard the conversation. He said What can I do. I opened chat option again got swiggy care number . By this time guest had gone eating pathetically and less. Swiggy care agreed to give refund in my saving account after giving me other options of swiggy money and voucher. It was heart burning experience.
"Today I have got a cockroach in the Soup(North Indian Meal), which I have ordered from A2B Veg(Rating 4.1)."
I am vegetarian. I have ordered vegetable biriyani from swiggy but they have delivered NON VEG biriyani.  Worst.
"This is regarding my order yest swarnam madhushala Ahmednagar Veg bhuna balls were not even dipped in gravy ..hard as stone, after 1hour 15mins of wait..TOTALLY WASTE OF MY 900/"
I am a long time users of Swiggy and it was great app. Customer support was great too but now they have been very bad.  I gave order no 114192804434 and received burnt tikki .  now Swiggy refunded me 15rs . wow I am amazed.  not using swiggy again
My order was delivered two hours late and nobody bothered to inform me the reason delivery boy bike tyre punctured  This is a regulàr excuse given for delayed delivery  Please don't try swiggyfor reliable service
"I found a bug on their stupid site, in their payment processing system, which results in multiple orders. After SO MANY hours of talking to their useless customer service folks and email support, I didn't any meaningful resolution.  MOST OF THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS COPY-PASTE STUFF THEY ALL WRITE.  They just blamed me and said since the orders were delivered they don't want to help.  THEY DON'T RESPECT CUSTOMERS. ONLY CARE ABOUT MONEY. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ARE USELESS TIME WASTERS."
The cost of the food is more expensive than the cost at the restaurant. I don't recommend swiggy at all zomato is much much better than all other food delivery companies
"Wth is this! Unbelievably dirty service! Swiggy should be closed! I ordered from KFC in Kolkata and they kept me waiting for 1 hr and then cancelled my order! No one should order food from Swiggy! Horrible dirty service and they call themselves ""hunger warriors""!  Never order from this unbelievably dirty app!"
"I ordered some items from Manasarovar sweets from Vasai a little while ago. After sometime, there was a message from Swiggy that methi thepla was not available. I edited the order and added khaman dhokla to the order. I had to pay ₹27 extra and the first time I tried, the transaction failed. I was trying again when I received a phone call from Zeenat, Swiggy who informed me that thepla was not available. I informed her what I was doing and she seemed happy that I am editing the order. After the phone call ended, I found that my payment retry was cancelled, and khaman was removed from the order. I tried the chat with customer service but for 5 minutes none responded. I called the complaint service and someone called Meenakshi picked up the phone and she said she will call the restaurant to know if khaman was available. She informed me after two minutes of wait that'it' is not available. When I asked her that if khaman is not available, she said that she will'check'.?! What was she checking for two minutes then? Also, she informed me that Zeenat had edited the order because my'transaction failed' with such venom as if I was begging for food not buying it. Finally, she edited the order for khaman after'checking' and asked me to pay ₹27 to the delivery boy. I have ordered from Swiggy many times and found that food is high in price and very low in quality and value. SWIGGY.WE BUY FOOD FROM YOU, WE DO NOT BEG. Please be polite when communicating with your customers.Also, keep people with some brains in the customer care, not IDIOTS."
Very poor refund policy  bad service  bad behave  I want to refund but not refund my amount yet
"Ordered veg rice bowl food from kfc, got non veg rice bowl so called customer care again they told they will order properly 2nd time also non veg receivedinstead of veg, customer care people told they will give coupon they had not given coupon also again they put cancelation fee on us only, all this happened at 11 night finally also we have not got food and money ours is wasted and again cancelation fee on us only, is this a silly thing what kind of services waste to exist , and all managers and customer care peoplewill behave rudely"
I got my order after 2.5 hours whose ETA was 30 mins in Dwarka Delhi . On the top of that the customer care executive Santanu was very rude and insensitive despite the utter inconvenience caused by swiggy . Hopeless!
"Some idiot mannerless person “pratik samaddar “ promised me to give coupon code worth Rs 300/-     As my order got canceled and u guys kept me waited for 4-5 hours.  Ended the chat without giving coupon code.    Delivery executive -when I called him asking for status of my order. he started conversation with bad words. He was totally unprofessional and disconnected the call.    When I tried taking customer care help- I didn’t get proper response and timely reply from their end. also, I didn’t saw any helping executives who seriously looking to resolve my issues. all they wanted to end the chat.      Worst service.  Totally pissed off. unprofessional customer care executives  Unprofessional delivery excutive  Worst service. will never going to order from swiggy  And never recommend swiggy to anyone  I will definitely put this issue on social media."
"I am not happy with the service provide by swiggy. Its the 3 rd time where my order is getting delayed and when u complaint the will say sorry we will check where is the executive, are but that even we can locate.My question to u is zhen why do you say that we will deliver it in so much time and all that stuff I can understand if the weather is bad and then is a delay but u are always the same.  Secondly yesterday I had ordered from swiggy and unfortunately my online payment was not working properly so I requested for cod and mentioned to please get the change. After saying also they didn't communicate that to the delivery executive.When he came to deliver he was not wearing the uniform no bag just came with parcel.  He didn't had the manner to talk how to behave stubborn and arrogant.He said I dont have change then I said ok and requested him to get the change from the shop which is just four mins walkable since my small daughter was all alone at home he said no I have other work and wasted that time in arruging with me spoke to swiggy executive and instead of telling him even he was fighting with me saying that we cannot force the delivery boy. But I suppose he is on the payroll and all the above atleast he should have the courtesy to behave with a female.  He was behaveing like a roadside loafer what kind of quality of people u hire. Really u people don't think about the customer because of u people my daughter was nearly waiting for one and half hour. Shame on u people.  Requesting u to stop this business SWIGGY is worst app the people now which they are hiring is also more wrost"
Mapping of SWIGGY is so poor that it takes delivery boy to some other location. It has a delayed delivery every time and so the result is they serve us cold food. Inspite of paying so much of our hard owned money all we get is cold food. Not worth at all. SWIGGY should immediately look into this matter or else they will loose all the valued customers. So SWIGGY now a days u really have a very pathetic service.
"I ordered coffee in Pune on 18th August and after 30 minutes, I received an email from Swiggy saying that you order is cancelled and the delivery boy attempted the delivery at our doorstep.  We placed the order from a office which is on the main road in Pune and the office building requires entry into the building.  Swiggy delivery requires approval in our building. There is no entry by the swiggy delivery boy in the system.  Swiggy has absolutely hopeless mapping system. This takes delivery boy to some other location. However, the real scam was discovered when we called the swiggy call center. There was a man by name Harsh Deep Singh, who was a very adamant call center executive. We requested to the executive to get the number of the delivery executive who delivered or tried to deliver the food. But the executive was adamant and kept saying - Galti Apki Hai.  Which means the delivery boy not reaching to the location is our fault.  The cancellation email coming from swiggy without calling us is our fault.  The delivery executive not calling anyone to confirm the location is the fault of customers.  Guys be aware of the scams of Swiggy. Swiggy customer executives like Harsh Deep Singh( I dont even know if he told right name)."
"Very very late delivery, the delivery person does not reply! At all.  And the refund takes two Hours!"
"Guys  These days swiggy is totally acting commercial and cheating customers  They are forcing delivery boys for multiple orders delivery and thereby forcing customer yo wait for longer time and adding to agony is cold food being received every time coz of delayed delivery  And they have come up with their cancellation policy, coz they adjust the time post order booking manually and often u find clock not clicking at all coz being manipulated everytime  Its been a routine now where these guys are adding frustration for the customer who have placed order  And smartly there is no ratings for swiggy service but only for restaurant and delivery boys but all the wrong strategies are being implemented byb swiggy  Request you all to note these cheap tricks being adopted by swiggy and ensure u give negative ratings based on your experience  to available options"
"First Of All Why The Hell You Guys Harass A Customer. I Even Complained About An Issue Of A Restaurant Earlier As Well But You Guys Didnt Have Gutts To Speak On Customers Behalf To The Restaurant If He Is Making A Mistake.  And If You Cannot Do Anything Then Why The Hell You Have Opened The delivery Services?  We Customers Rely On You For The Delivery Only Then We Order Food You A Trust, But If We Are Getting The Issues In The Food Again And Again Then Whats The Fun In Ordering Food From You.  Secondly You People Sell Food More Than The MRP Decided By The Restaurants, And I Have A Proof Of It. Then Why The Hell You Charge Us So Much If You Want To Leave Your Weapons And Runaway?  START TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE WORK YOU PEOPLE DO, I KNOW THE COMPANY WORKS IN INDIA BUT STOP BEING LIKE A TYPPICAL INDIAN COMPANY WHO DONT EVEN CARE FOR THE SERVICES"
Delivery is very fast and Delivery boy behaviour nad talking very nice all most superster Farhan shakh ha
"Many a times, my order was picked up by the delivery guy, who conveniently ignored to update the system, took the order home and I had to sleep hungry as the restaurants close by 11 PM and Swiggy notified me at 11:35 PM that the order is cancelled.  I have been talking to them since 8 days now. No action or any suitable compensation offered by Swiggy."
Start paying salaries to your employees. Don't pay them 20rs per delivery. Such a shame on this company.
"I order and make payment for one order by netbanking, but my order did not take. I inform this to customer service - they said payment failed so we can't accept your order, even I have screenshot of payment made to swiggy, when I gave proof they deleted the complete chat support where I have done complaint against it. I lost my money, not received any order, the customer service deleted the chat, so swiggy is having new trick to earn money and fraud with people. From now I ll try my best to show this real face of swiggy."
"I have very bad experience. Because i have cancelled my order but swiggy didn't refund the money.. So I was disappointed, no food. No money.. Delivery boy said that if you want cancell the order u can do it. Then I have been cancelled but no money refunded. ????????"
I had a baby shower party of 15 people at my place and had ordered dinner from swiggy... The estimated time showed 50mins and after like 40-45mins i get a call saying they cannot deliver my order and have to be cancelled. Finally i had to order from a local restaurant .. And my whole plan was ruined.. On this the the executive had promised me a coupon code for the time i had to wait ... But i never recieved any coupon code and on checking back with swiggy i come to knw there was no promise as such.. And the executive just plain lied to me... WOW.... On contrary he was saying tht i was lying abt the promise and no promise was given..... Wat a customer service.... Grt.. I will never be goin back to swiggy again... And wud never suggest swiggy to anyone either.... THANKU SWIGGY FOR RUINING MY BABY SHOWER
Always provides quality food with nearest available best restaurants. Their websites works perfectly with no problem to load the pages.
Horrible service and they have false description on item and pathetic customer service  They waste customer money
After asked to deliver to nearby address delivery guy was unreachable and there help link is of no use. And if you contact through email later they give lame excuse of exceed 5 hours. They don't want to find out why order didn't deliver and forget about the refund amount.
"I order regularly from swiggy and they have various positive things include reasonable price good delivery services but on various occasions when there is something wrong with your order costomers service doesn't respond properly for an instance, Once I ordered Shahi Paneer and they delivered me Dal makhkhani, I was so disappointed when I raised a concern they ask me to report it to restaurant rather than them. It was such a foolish act, while I am paying you why would restaurant is responsible for order mix up. They should work properly on them"
"When asked about the address I entered location. After 45 mins delivery person is saying address is not serviceable. I dont understand, if the address is not serviceable, why did you take the order in first place. The call center guy is saying that I need to cancel the order as the address is not serviceable.  Why should I pay for this? I did not cancelled my order the, you people do that. Why should I pay for it then? Either pay back the entire money or deliver the order.  Not at all happy with the service! absolutely not recommending swiggy to anyone."
"With ETA 26 min, they are unable to deliver even after 1 hr. While request for cancellation will cost you the entire order amount including delivery charges. On top of all, despite delay in order preparation, the delivery boy will distribute other order on the way/off the way and then will give you your order. Customer care unavailable. No choice but to move to other food app :-/"
"These guys are looting people's money in the name of delivery charges, and. Other charges etc... Even after paying and waiting hours long for the food, these delivery boys and restaurant people delivery pathetic answers we don't have electricity so we can't deliver order, another restaurant tells wr don't have delivery boys at their store, so can't deliver food! While asking for refund, these guys telling cancellation charges etc... As customers what can we do if delivery boy or restaurant cancels orders, why we have to bear those unnecessary charges? These types apps should ban in India!"
"Never ever place order with Swiggg Worst experience with swiggy, This time delivery agent was missing his number was switched off, customer care had not responded, even restaurant (Insta Pizza, Rajouri garden new delhi) was not pickup, Finally they come with a reason that there system was stuck!!!!!! Due to which either you cancel your order or re assign that cold Pizza with new executive. They really don't care for there customers."

"Order#108398808490 there wa 2 items , I had received only 1 item which not as per the cart.Swiggy charged for both the items.Post this there is no resolution no refund of my amount.Thinks swiggy has started a new scam to charge the customer and don't provide the deliver as per cart.More than 72 hours has completed no resolution has been provided ."
"Swiggy is not at all bothered on attending customer issues, I experience these behaviour from couple of order recently.just bcz on raising concern on quality of food from restaurants and issues. They stopped or what ever they did whenever I try to go help and raise issue conversation get closed immediately.they r least bothered to listen or anything. For name sake they allow to select list of issue an d make it closed without solution. So stupidly behaving from swiggy to customers. Most of us helplessly opting swiggy.so they r taking granted. Swiggy take action on these issues from ur end.. other wise no longer u will be serving"
"Order number#106457819286, They have charged 664 Ruppes to deliver cake, they went to different set location than to Delivery location mentioned in the order. Very bad service the customer care people did not even understand the issue. Very bad experience and money looting."
"Ordered Chicken Biryani(Family) and Chicken Manchurian on 10th June 2021. Order ID: 106379464778.  Worst ever chicken biryani we have eaten in Hyderabad during last 25 years.  Reasons: The Chicken in Biryani was extremely tough, fibrous and not at all cooked properly to make it edible. Entirely chicken was removed and discarded,  Chicken in Manchurian: Was also tough and fibrous and could have been cooked much better.  It was a total Loss and never again will we order from Mujtaba Grills and perhaps from Swiggy also.  Others, please be aware of this!"
I don'tknow why they can't just ring the bell and make the delivery. Every time I order for my parents in another city I am discouraged by the number of calls I have to attend to for the delivery. The address is there clear and there's even a google location . Then why so many calls.  And come to customer service. They miss items like regular stuff. I am a vegetarianin a non vegetarianfamily and invariablythey have messed up with orders andmissed the veg food.  And the customerservice will stink of false empathy and push you to brink of 'GTH'. They will only pay you the cash for missingfood. All that waiting and going hungry or havingto eat maggi at an odd hour is not worth considerationfor swiggys customerservice.  Isense doom for them shortly. When jetairways was behavingsimilarlywe couldsense where it was going and now we all know how it went.
"Pathetic service..I have ordered recently from Nagarjuna restaurant through Swiggy. I saw a message saying your order has been cancelled. When I tried contacting them their phone numbers, those were designed not to receive any calls you can only get harrassed.  I used their chat service and got to know that they cant do anything. Can you imagine at 3pm afternoon your meal will be canclled automatically and in response you will just get that you will be charged fully for your cancellation..why dont they understand if you are charging fully you should deliver it and charge full..and why someone will cancel when they know your preset clause that you will charge them in full..what do you do with the food cancelling them purposefully.  Bunch of idiots who have set the clauses.."
Bad Bad experience . They keep money and do not pass on the order and they Swiggy tries to say they are sorry. put their money where their mouth it. my refund is still not with me and who ever is responsible is still there and ready to mess up another job.
"#Pathetic service.  I happened to order food for my family from a restaurant. No idea whom to blame. swiggy team and the restaurant owner played a smart game blaming each other. The order was not delivered. No one took the responsibility to inform about the issue. when called was told it was a technical issue. When spoke to swiggy the representative said the order was not prepared due to confusion. When called the Delivery Executive, was told the order has been prepared and ready but they are waiting for a confirmation from swiggy.  Such a disaster way of minting money where they are ready to cancel the order but not refund immediately.  This is not the first experience with Swiggy.  This also happened on my birthday in 2019.  #dominos has delivered spoiled food, just becoz we have ordered food at 10 am in the morning.  Couples of experiences put together, holding my horses not to share a negative review on or about anyone or anything.  Finally, the time has come that I had to update a review.  Very disappointed with the swiggy team, its process, and procedures which only mints money and nothing else.  Sheer waste of time where I finally ended up spoiling my day as well as my family's day.  During this lockdown, we had to run around for food in the night.  This takes a default 1 rating which is not required too.  You need to rethink Swiggy."
"Customer service never reply you on time and always try to buy time for getting their delay justified. They have nothing in their control and there is no reverse SLA on them for their service  Customer has to suffer for delay from restaurant, delivery boy delay and also any excuses like bike breakdown, multiple deliveries"
I had booked from this.But very disapointing and time wasting.I dont like this site beacuse of poor food delivery.  One day I had waited for food lot of time and they delivered very late .
"Customer care very bad. I give one order sp chicken fried rice. but got chicken biriyani. I ask customer care person help. customer care person send mail after 8hr swiggy contact u. I didn't eat dinner . I don't want, 1star very very bad service."
"Almost all meat delivery stores listed on Swiggy in Bangalore are cheating customers wrt quantity. I have tracked this from many stores and multiple orders using a proper digital kitchen scale.  BE ALERT!!  This is what is happening:  1) 300-320 gm delivered instead of 500gm  2) 900 gm instead of 1.2kg  Be smart and protect yourself from this widespread scam by verifying the weight at home. Though we can only give low ratings and complain to Swiggy, at least you will be able to find a store who is not cheating.  Stay safe."
Brief  Yesterday I have order some food from Swiggy and in today's Review I just want to share my views and opinions about Swiggy while ordering food how helpful Swiggy is .  Pros  Ul : it is really simple when it comes to it's Ul and there is nothing like a complicated process while Ordering food.  Large Number of Brands : Swiggy has really extensive range of Brands and restaurant it have every restaurant that you want to order from.  Great Discounts : Swiggy Offers Huge Kind of Discounts Every time You Ordered.  Promised Delivery : it deliverse On Displayed Time.  Cons  Delivery : sometimes Delayed Delivery.  Cost : When we physical visit restaurant it's price of food is low as compared to the Swiggy.  Less Food Quantity : shows Something Deliverse something.  Conclusion  If you don't have time to visit or you are not in the mood of visiting restaurant then you can order food from it. The Food they are showing and the Food They are Actually delivering is Completely different Quantity and Quality wise both.  Stay safe Stay indoors  Peace.
Worst app worst customer service. Never gonna use this app again and I recommend others also not to use it.
"I really wonder why many people are giving a very low rating for Swiggy. I am Swiggy customer from the last 3-4 years and I am happy with their service. Infact I should say they have improved a lot recently, atleast from the last one year. I think most of the guys who have rated Swiggy low is due to the outlets not providing good food or not behaving with customers properly. Infact, behaviour of the delivery guys can also be a reason. I would definitely not hesitate to appreciate all the delivery guys for providing support during these pandemic times. A BIG thanks to all of you - SWIGGY and the delivery guys."
"I had ordered cupcakes from cake zone. The delivery had completely damaged cupcakes I placed a complaint and a second delivery was dispatched. That arrived in the same damaged condition. On the second delivery I opened the package in front of the delivery man and showed him the damaged cakes. He blamed the shop, told me to place a complaint and left."
I think many peoples spred rumour about swiggy bad service but every rumour is wrong. Because I also ordered on swiggy so delivery is on time and delivery boy is also disciplined.
Food delivered very late and customer care response was too worst. They don't bother about customer satisfaction. I will never order again via swiggy
"Swiggy has worst customer service .All they do is deliver clichéd responses, and frustrate customer s, so that they can cancel order and move on."
"Terrible experience everytime I use this service, these people have horrible food partners and sick customer service"
Ridiculous Services by Swiggy!!!! Never going to use there services ever!!! They harass customers after taking money!!!THIRD CLASS SERVICE!!
"We ordered food on 5th April  a uthapam was missing we called delivery person he harshly replied you have not ordered it .we then made swiggy live chat they said missing item would be delivered within 15 minutes. We waited for hours & hours, made many calls and chat. Nobody delivered  it. Atlast after 3 hours they said that we wouldn't receive the missing food, and they promised to refund the cost .We didn't receive any refund till today but they had closed our refund status in customer history .we made email, called Tollfree No, made chat but no use"
"The Swiggy team is adept at making promises and not keeping them. I had placed an order on the app on 17th of April, when I complained about the condition of the food, I got a call back promising that the amount would be refunded to me and I would get free deliveries. I was happy. Then when I followed up on the chat portal because Swiggy has the right to call their customers but we as customers don't have that privilige, I was told they cant find any records and now since the time frame is over they cant do anything. WOW talk about service. I took the effort and pain to contact their leadership team via LinkedIn and email, I didnt get any response at all. Today I got a call from apparently their escalation team stating in no uncertain terms that they apparently have investigated this issue - if you can believe that and again they cant find any records of my conversation. .so essentialy they cant do anything. I have a good mind of taking them to the consumer court. I really hope Mr Sriharsha. M lookas at this because he doesnt bother to respond to customers anyway. Very poor, very pathetic."
"I orderd two food items on Swiggy, from a restuarant near our residence. After waiting much beyond the committed delivery time, we started calling the delivery crew at his mobile number. The call was never answered and when we contacted the restaurant, they also informed that they were waiting for the Swiggy person to pick up. The live tracking site of Swiggy was showing that the food was being prepared in the restaurant!  I complained to Swiggy on 25th March by e-mail, the Request no. is 10450984. They were supposed to reply within 12- 24 hours. So far(after more than 30 hours) no reply has been received and when I called the Swiggy(Kolkata) no., it never got through. I have already paid for the foods while placing the order online, and am not sure how at least the money will be refunded and when."
We placed an order for 4 burgers from Burger King which was on offer but received only 2 burgers with a different bill from the amount we paid. Clearly showing that it was not our order and that there was a mistake. When we called customer care they kept arguing irrelevantly saying that the order was the right one. There was absolutely no use of calling customer care. Totally hopeless and a waste of time because they said that they could not solve our problem and that we had to send a mail.  When people are hungry and waiting for a meal is this the time to wait for a reply in the mail box indefinitely. So please don't trust Swiggy because you will end up starving. This is not the first time we are facing this issue.
I have ordered fud.after one minute I called customer care to cancel my order n take new order.he is saying if u cancel this order u have to pay whole bill amt for cancellation. Wow this kind of service swigy they r giving. Guy don't order in swigy better u choose another app.n they have communication problem.
"Never ever order food from Minerva coffee shop Hyderabad through Swiggy .I always had very bad experience and suspect the problem is actually with swiggy delivery people.  Its a mixture of experiences - several fines, we noticed or or two items be missed out and today, they have replaced two of food items with road side prep- wrst experience..  Don't go for Minerva THRU Swiggy"
"Hello friends  Love this application, I ordered regularly customer service amazing the price put ridiculously high I am a regular customer of a nearby hotels and I know it's price.  Everything else is fine, food delivery also gets on time. Sometimes due to poor packaging, food packaging comes out. I understand that there are a lot of problems in bringing food from hotels to home. All these problems they can be handled much better"
I had ordered kwality icecream from Swiggy. The price on the pack is Rs 149 and Swiggy is charging Rs 165/-. This has happened before too. We tend not to check and Swiggy merrily cheats. Beware friends.
"Very disappointment for order placing.its not shown near by Restaurants.If we order one particular restaurant, but we received the order from local restaurant or others.Service tax is very high.  Quantity are very less then the order quantity and images are not relevant to actual received items.  Not Satisfied ."
"There is no option for Quantity (only piece selection option is available). Fruits and Vegetables are not bought in pieces, but in Kgs.  That option is not present in Swiggy Genie. Due to such Poor Software System, Both the Customer & Delivery Agent has to Suffer Harassment.  ....  Also, during Critical Situation, Swiggy People do not attend on phone. Everything cannot be explained accurately and effectively just on chat."
I order a lot of food online but there is only a few app through which we can order and swiggy is one of them. I have noticed many problems which need to be addressed.  First thing I need to mention about swiggy that their service is not so good. first we order food only by looking the stars but food could not match the taste standered that has been shown through the stars.  Second restaurent some time sent the wrong food. For example once I have ordered veg momos using swiggy as I am pure vegetarian but they have sent me non veg momos. I raised a complaint against it and they have only returned money without any sorry. Being a vegetarian its a very big deal to recieve non veg food.  Third restaurent normally doesn't pick call if we want to mention something. They should atleast pick customer's call.
Never ever order from kfc. Just now i ordered food from kfc madipakkam through swiggy. Most of the items were missing. When i complained to swiggy they just told me to mail them which will take 6 to 8 hrs to reply. The customer service executive was so rude. Nearly my 1000 rs is lost. Now i tried contacting kfc madipakkam. Line gets connected and they disconnect the cal abrubtly. Never ever order through swiggy and never order kfc. Mc Donalds is far way vetter than kfc
I have placed my order 3hrs ago in Swiggy app for raw chicken. Till the time I contacted the Customer care noone bothered to reach out and inform me that the order can't be delivered. The funny part is they are only sorry about the horrible service
"They are game changer, ordering food is equivalent to Swiggy, it's swift and safe. Lots of offer makes things pocket friendly."
"This is one app which disappoint me every time I order food but I always give it a try if they improve there service but they have failed all the time, I am writing this so they can improve there service. On 13th march I order food(order No #98722201463) from this app and I was out for some reason I thought of making payment by my Debit Card, After completing transaction my money got debited from my account and it says Something went wrong please retry.  They have initiated the refund but question is not about refund question is about there service, This app is build to deliver food when required but it dint happened.  This same thing had happened with me many a time."
The delivery time it took one hour and food you can look in attachment not only this but every thing was worst today we four people ate this food and sware never to order again on swiggy as it's not ist time you people don't even think about customer is hungry and ordering a good food to eat at your prices if we ate at hotel or go for pack than we can change or ask the owner to change but you people just work for your own com not humanity
"I ordered a dish on given rates and swiggy cancelled the order by its own as it was showing lower rates than usual, and I asked swiggy why they cancelled my order? They replied with a LAME REASON that they thought I was in hurry and ordered something different.  Com'on swiggy GROW UP..!  MY RATING TO SWIGGY : ""-5 STARTS"
Made an online order for my parents in India. It did not let me detect the location for restaurants near my home and then chose the wrong location itself. This created the whole chaos and food wasn't delivered for an hour.  After I talked in customer service they tried to put it all on the food place while to it was their fault to begin with. Never using Swiggy again and definitely won't recommend to anyone.
"I've been using swiigy since 2017. Been ordering from the app in Navi Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru.What I like about the service is they have good delivery and many a times extended their service to replace food items when its oily or too spicy, which has never been a scenario while ordering food."
"Hi,  My self lohith placed an order in your Swiggy but my order not received and deliver partner has marked as delivered  Tried contacting to all the customer care exective  but no responce from them, worst experience  below is my order number:97925217757  Delivery Exective Name:Raja  Phno: 780956xxxx"
"Order Id 97697258244  Order Date 01/03/2021  Paid Amount Rs 544  On March 1st 2021 I made an order from swiggy where I made a payment of Rs 544 which includes charges such as Taxes worth Rs 26.37 and Order Packing Charges worth Rs 4.50.  First of all, the order was delay from swiggy, the delivery person was lazy and not having knowledge of handling of the food. He made all Packaging spoiled due to which I have to ask to swiggy customer care to replace it.  After a long time the swiggy delivery person came to me without the main item  I.e hazelnut Brownie which made me very angry I reported this regarding to swiggy support and the support is very bad they didnt even refund me till now nor I have recieved that special item which for I have Pay Rs 110.  Very disappointing service from the swiggy customer Care."
"Off late Swiggy has become the most unreliable food delivery service and my feedback is based on not just one but multiple back to back experiences that I have had with their delivery executives. They all seem to have one common excuse whenever they fail to deliver the food on time. They always say that, 'they met with an accident, got injured or their bike broke down! It's like they are simply not bothered about the customer reviews or management anymore! There have been times when my order didn't get delivered at all ! Yes, it never reached me and when I tried contacting the executive, their phone was switched off! Even after several escalations, the customer care was also not able to track their delivery executive !"
"Liers, not on time, app itself says wrong delivery time and support is so arrogant, even delivery boys too"
Received wrong item ln night & very long process of complain in swiggy. No response by restaurant also.
For 5 times they Cancelled my order after 40-50 minutes of order time and tell restraunt is closed and as it is night by the they cancel all other restraunts also will get closed when I want to know details the customer executive will disconnect call and initiate refund as If I am ordering refund from swiggy
Swiggy and these restaurants make a real fool of us on the name od discounts .the amount swiggy gives us a discount the restaurants cut it from our food items..ordered food from raj restaurant chembur ..another theif.....never trust swiggy ir ths restaaurant
Order at lunch if you want your dinner on time... Swiggy is most pathetic way to order food... They will not let you cancel any order after a minute but these people and their hopeless systems cancels the order 45mins after placing it and then has the guts to tell us to place order again... It is food not clothing etc for which you can wait.... You can give benefit of doubt once may be twice but Swiggy has made it a habit. Very unprofessional behaviour. If the customers have time limit to cancel then delivery partner should also follow the same rule.
"I lost Rs 628/- to Swiggy. They canceled my order within 5 minutes and;; it has been 30 days now, there is no Refund. They are asking me to check with my bank! I'm totally frustrated with Swiggy help desk. My order was dated 26th Jan 21."
"Have had a number of issues with swiggy before, but today's episode was a nail in the coffin. I ordered for 8 rotis but was delivered ONLY 1.When I called the customer service, they say that I need to write an email to them and someone would reach out to me in the next 7-8 hours - after which I can have my ""dinner"". Absolutely no way to treat your customers! When someone orders for food, it is expected we receive the correct order/quantity and if we don't, it is swiggy's responsibility to make it right. I was instead simply told that ""someone will respond to your mail in 7-8 hours"" ( no one cares about your dinner ma'am!) . This is the last time I will ever use your horrible services."
Swiggy offers the worst food delivery services I had a very bad experience with their delivery. Unfortunately they also don't have any ratings system post delivery unlike Xomato. The Swiggy delivery partners are usually don't use GPS to track location they are indulged in too much calling very bad delivery experience
"I have been a loyal customer of Swiggy for many years now, but, of late, their delivery boys have become very rude, ill-behaved, ill-mannered, rough and aggressive lacking the basic good manners, courtesy and etiquette. Have had several terrible experiences with the delivery boys in the recent past. And what is most sad, disappointing and annoying is the fact that ""Swiggy"" is siding with and encouraging such blatant misbehaviour on the part of the delivery boys, instead of reprimanding them and taking strict disciplinary action against them. Their attitude and response to my several complaints and grievances via several chats and emails says it all. I am terribly hurt and aggrieved with the reply/reaction/response from ""Swiggy'. Totally unacceptable. Will now think a hundred times before ordering from ""Swiggy"" again in the future. ""Swiggy's"" loss is someone else's gain. It's as simple as that."
Same order from restaurant n order from swiggy its rs. 100 different..  Fraud of rs. 100..order no. 96744397935..  Uninstalled swiggy...
"I ordered food from Jumbo King, Parel outlet, and there were live ants on the coke container. Swiggy did nothing about it. Horrible service."
80% food missing and Swiggy cheaply refunds partial Amount..no ownership and no sense of CX. Chat bot says only 1 thing that he is sorry..absolutely cheap And horrendous service
Pathetic swiggy service ever. Charging more for items and showing delivered where item was not delivered. My kids starved and had to eat maggie
"Quality & Delivery to the lowest level. We ordered 4 dishes via Swiggy and 1 dish is not even included in the delivery. The remaining 3 dishes, 1 dish is not packaged properly and spilled all over the swiggy bag. No food for the family . Swiggy cancellation is another mess. 5-7 days as per terms & conditions and if not I will need to chat with call center to get my refund. Swiggy hopefully you will be able improve service on agent facing, sales. Absolutely unacceptable and inhumane."
I am a regular customer but I will tell your service sucks. You guys either go to wrong address and deliver nor cancel the order nor take hours to deliver . My latest order took 8 hours and I am still seeing that the delivery person is enroute to deliver . I would suggest not to use swiggy services and look for alteri. Frustrated with this service
Delivery is excellent for order Order #96014586054. The delivery boy understood my office address and location of self beautifully. as we have more than 300 employees.
I have ordered from swiggy this guys took too much to deliver and before delivery I have called the executive to explain him the directions actually my place just 1-2km away from the restaurant he took 50mins still not reached my place first when I called him to explain the directions he cut my call with out listening and he got lost in directions. That the reason why hate swiggy this guys don’t maintain proper crew and they don’t take action in this
"I ordered Food through Swiggy today, money paid through phonepe, the tracker showed food picked up from DFC, Rajahmundry.  Time showed as 7 mins for delivery.  Tried calling the delivery person, mobile switched off.  After 30 mins it showed it showed 3 mins, chatted with Customer care. Later I waited for 30 mins, finally canceled order. Very upset. I am yet to get my money back in days. Kids waited with hung"
Worst experience I have ordered dosa bt I recieved idly which I didn't order I called restaurant they said they gave dosa only .I still didn't get response from customer service worst
Never order food through Swiggy especially on Sundays. If you do you will be starved for sure. I had a lot of bitter experiences on Sundays with Swiggy. So i switched to zomato who are more reliable.
"Very bad service . They took 100rs. Extra from my mother , I had ordered for 241rs. Including the coupon which they gave but he took 345rs. From my mother ."
Now a days they assign multiple deliveries to one delivery boy. That means late pickup of the order and late delivery. They will show on app that order will reach in 30 minutes but you end up waiting for more than 01 hour till the time food reaches to you. At the end food is cold and stale. If you ask for a refund it will not be granted and you feel cheated.
"I ordered Oven story pizza combo with some other item. One of the item from the combo was missing. I placed my concern on the same day, Swiggy acknowledged me for refund but haven't proceed with it. Order number#94396456816  When i tried to follow up with Swiggy's support, they declined saying it.  Pathetic experience. Will never order again."
"Ordered Naturals ice-cream from swiggy. Delivered absolutely horrible, fake and stale ice-cream boxes with exactly the same cover as original Naturals. When discussed the issue with them on chat, refused to refund or replace the order and promised a compensatory coupon of 600 Rs, which also was never given and later denied. Was a very old customer but extremely dissatisfied with their dishonest attitude. Have deleted swiggy and will never order again."
Swiggy is had not good service. They are not providing good services for customers . Zomato is better than swiggy . So i will say not to use swiggy.  Prefer zomato they are giving good services to customers . Swiggy is worst .
Worst customer care support. They are not responsive. Please do not use swiggy. Zomato is much better
"I'm one of the loyal customer of Swiggy placed an order id 95152611518 by 12:47pm and around 13:14 received a call from Swiggy and it was conveyed to me that the order was picked by other delivery agent so Swiggy will refund the money.  I replied that this is the not the first time it happened to me and Swiggy can check my orders how generous I'm being for the past such incidents. Swiggy mentioned that they can give me a compensation coupon of Rs.25, is this the way Swiggy values it's customer's time and hunger. I would have appreciated if Swiggy might have made another arrangement to ensure the delivery happens instead of such lethargic support service.  I escalated to the supervisor but his reply was also not a solution to solve my hunger.  All in a sudden I got a notification that the order is delivered this is a deceiving. Is Swiggy making money out if its customer's hunger? What is the justice for the hunger?"
My order(Order ID: 14218463) for plastic container was cancelled from Swiggy Assist but till date I didn't get any refund or notification from them. They take almost 20 days to cancelled my order with out any notifications. Also the helpline number is+917259085922 switched off till date. This is not a professional behavior expected from Swiggy. Pathetic Service.
"Zomato service bester then swiggy service , don’t take service from swiggy, not on time and call support all so not good"
Ordered beer and wine through Swiggy - received order with missing items - delivery agent is confessing he delivered 8 bottles where as the item ordered was 13 bottles - I had placed In order for a friend and we realised order was short - when contacted customer service / they washed their hand saying we should have crossed check the order - WOW !!! Y Swiggy didn’t check order before delivery ???  Trust issue !!!
I had order from swiggi and my payment was also dedicated and even I havent received the food and order get cancel. Even they are not given refund. Will never order
Too much bad experience bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad never go with swiggy
"This is worst app and worst service. They are experts in cancelling orders and ripping off more than half of your money. On top of this they picture themselves as they too generous to refund us half the value of the order. The reason they give for cancelling the order is ""you din't respond to our call"". They claim that they system says so that they called.  In reality they never bother to call or even try to call. Big-time cheating app."
"We had placed an orders (#94053444547) from Mithas on 18th Jan but the order was cancelled from Swiggy. Immediately after that we placed another order that was delivered to same address. As the order was cancelled by Swiggy, We were expecting the refund to come from them. Later we came to know that they have deducted the entire amount as cancellation charges for the order that they cancelled. This is ridiculous."
"I had very bad experience with Swiggy customer care and delivery person , I given complaint in Swiggy customer about Swiggy delivery person which he made me unsafe, given complaint multiple time even though there is no propar response nor mail from them , very pooor service they give stop using Swiggy, go for multiple options are there with good service"
"I ordered 3 lava cakes on the 14th of January. They delivered only one. When I complained, they only refunded money for 2 of them. Kudos cheating. ."
Horrible support team. Completely unapologetic to the customer. Waited for 30 minutes in the cold for an order in karol bagh for a patient. No call recieved. Maybe the covid crunch is too much for them to be human. Inhuman thing was that the patient had to wait for another 45 min. Thnx swiggy. Lost a super user plus a long time regular for 166 INR. Go zomato! .
Very very bad experience I advice not to use this cheap app for food all member of this are not able to even speak they shoud close company they only make loss to.people from cancel there order...  Very bad company swigyyyyyyy very bad
"I am too much disappointed with swiggy. I got my food in bad condition. No taste, bad handling of food as well"
"I lost 5000 rupeess which I added to swiggy wallet . I added it on 31 dec 2020 and later I had to change my contact number . from 1st jan 2021 the funds disappeared . I chatted , emailed and called swiggy many times . its been more than 15 days now they have still not resolved the issue . everytime I contact them they are asking me more and more time . please dont believe swiggy anymore . They are frauds and stealing peoples money upfront . I want swiggy to refund all my money with penalty for my time and money spent on phone calls ."
Being a genuine customer for all these years I had experienced bad quality food delivered for the first time. I had enjoyed the service and had recommended the app to many of my friends. But shocked and disappointed this time. Had offered fried rice from a good reviewed hotel and received soaked rice. Probably the hotel had sent the leftovers. I want my money back not in bits and pieces.
I ORDERED BUT STILL NOT DELIVERED MY Order #93684301784 VERY POOR SERVICES DON'T USE SWIGGY! NO REFUND AND NO RESPOND MY CALL
"Very bad service, delivery not on time, delivery time increased five minutes after help again and again, bad experince"
I am requesting not to use thier service they have cancelled my order and even not refund my amount in the lockdown I suffer a lot I don't have money
"I ordered a special Thali from Sagar Gaire of Rs. 185 /- from Bhopal. I chose upi payment. The application was showing food is preparing for last 2 hours. It's crazy guys, I had train on same day. I left for Delhi after waiting about 3 hours but food was not delivered.  After covid-19 it's my worst experience with swiggy. I love it before by the way."
I just wanted to recommend everyone try swiggy coz it gives fast delivery as well as they have the connections with best restaurant who provides the delicious food  Also I want to tell about the discount/offers by swiggy is worth I am sharing my experience I am using it from last 2 years and I always prefer swiggy for online food order.  I also compared other online food app and website but they couldn't give such a good service.
Ordered goods not delivered and then even refund is not done.  Complete cheating and strongly recomend not to use this site
"On 23-12-2020, I ordered Burgers from Mc Donalds via Swiggy. Patties in the Burger were raw.not at all cooked and food was cold(not even warm). I raised the complained on the same day with Swiggy. They replied me back on 25-12-2020 saying that they could have acted if I had written within one day(when I actually wrote them within one hour and they read my complained after 2 days).  When I highlighted their mistake, they came back to me saying ""Having gone through your email, we see that you reported having received poor quality food on this order. Since the restaurant is solely responsible for the preparation of the food, we will be unable to compensate you for this issue.""  Please don't use Swiggy. Zomato is still far better."
"Very bad experience, pls don't order from swiggy instead use other apps that are much better than swiggy"
I ordered some burgers from swiggy but they sent me a NON-VEG burger very disappointed. Please don't order from swiggy you can use ZOMATO it's better.
We ordered food on new year eve from Swiggy. Since there was condirion that no refund if you cancel the order. They didn't deliver the food and marked the status as delivered. Support team is also not helping except auto response mail that need 24 hrs. to investigate. Please be careful bout such offer. Verybad experience with Swiggy.
"Swiggy is the best online food delivering product . most of the people like and buy this online food. these are provide many food failities like shawama, burger, chicken lolipop etc. the cost of food is very less expensive compared to other others . I recommend to all buy the food swiggy and enjoy the swiggy"
Delivery boy lied that I did not answer the call and cancelled the order. swiggy denied to make a refund of money. What a FRAUD company. They ate up my 836 rupees. They are denying to share a call log showing the delivery boys attempt to call me. What a FRAUD place and people... Beg borrow steal for money would be a better option... A bunch of Fraudsters
"I ordered burger today on 31/12/2020 order no#92485871033.. Because of some genuine reasons , I couldn't pick up the phone. I have given detailed adress and I am staying at decent locality. Still only as I didn't receive the call, Swiggy cancelled my order and neither I received food nor my money(Rs.640/- . )After 20 min I saw missed call and called customer care then they were giving stupid answers..  such a ridiculous service and people are!!!"
Not accepted this from swiggy.  Bad delivery.  This was not what we accepted. I loved this place and got this
I ordered chole kulche from lunchbox restaurant but their service is very disgusting. My order id is 90162912860. Swiggy delievery box is very rude. He said he is busy and will deliver my food after 1 hour. I called swiggy customer care but they said they can't do anything as the delivery boy is not picking up call and food os with him. 3 hours passed but my food was never delievered. The delivery boy blacklisted my number and my money which I paid online got wasted. Really poor service of swiggy.
Swiggy is one of my favorites. I have ordered food many times form it they give good quality food on time. They also have fast delivery. I am satisfied with it. You all must try.
"I ordered the food at around 9 pm. The delivery agent by the name Sivakumar has been moving in opposite direction. Then few minutes later it is marked as delivered. When called he said he has given it to some lady. I enquired, no one has received the order. He lied about it. Probably he has eaten off the order. When asked him to come back to location and point the lady out, he denied.  Swiggy customer care is pathetic and useless. They will read out the script and always eager to escape from the issue with a refund. If you say you don't need the refund, they are okay to proceed with that. Delivery guy was very rude and challenging me to complain. Swiggy is useless. By the time everything was over it was around 11:30 pm. Almost all restaurant shut. I have ordered again, hopefully it gets delivered and I don't have to sleep in empty stomach."
"I have ordered a food yesterday from the swiggy outlet but the delivery boy took 20 minutes to hand over the parcel to me, even after reaching at my place. when i opened it, i saw the packet has already been opened and tasted from the corner. i asked the delivery executive to take it back, as i want to replace but he refused. later i mailed many times, uploaded pictures for proof but no response i get. even i did not get my refund also."
I just ordered a mandi. One of your delivery person has not delivered a food but in the app it's showing it's delivered then I called him then he is using very vulgar language his name is shakeel 728786xxxx
Just check the restaurant menu before ordering anything price is 3x they charge only same menu rate in big restaurants that’s it like Meghana’s n all
"Zomato is much much better than swiggy. Swiggy delivery sucks, delivery boys have zero experience to handel the customers and they don't have manners to talk. For rating I've rather give zero star but it's compulsory to give atleast one. They don't deliver food on time infact sometimes they don't deliver it also. Swiggy sucks!!!!"
Fraud company.uninstall it. Zomato is better that swiggy. customer service of swiggy is also fraud. Don't use it.
"This is now third time I have ordered from Swiggy. My delivery address is a well-known hotel and delivery instructions are crystal clear.  Three times now - the driver today cancelled the order while he was in front of the hotel(followed on map) and while I was chatting with the customer service on chat. I have photo of the chat with time stamp= the customer service agent confirmed ""the delivery agent has reached the hotel now.""  Two minutes later I received a cancellation notification. I called Swiggy, with photographs and time stamps of the conversation and they only agreed to refund me 50% of what I paid. I declined and called my credit card(AMEX) and notified them of fraud and offered to send the photos of the chat with time stamp. AMEX was wonderful - they refunded on the spot and blocked the transaction.  I then ordered the same with Zomato - and after two hours finally received the burrito I was craving. This will be my LAST time using Swiggy. You would think during these hard times of Covid, they would be happy to work with customers to get them the food they have ordered. But sadly this was not the case. I have deleted Swiggy off my phone and suggest you don't waste your time or money with these fraudsters."
I ordered food from swiggy and it got cay just because delivery boy could not reach my location after giving proper direction. And all loss is mine. There are so unprofessional. First they agreed to refund after 2 minutes the denied. Lack of integrity. Very disappointed. It's like they are running scam. If your phone is unreachable for 10 minutes it's their lucky day because according to their policy they have right to eat your food and you will sponsor it. They will cancel the order and will not refund you also
What kind of service you all giving swiggy we already give proper direction to delivery person delivery boy so damn! arogant simple direction cant find and you swiggy just cancel our order u dont refund the money you cant give proper service
"Many time my order gets canceled after ordering, bcos the delivery person has picked up the wrong food or the delivery person alloted has not gone to pick up. The are unapologetic and simply say we have to cancel your order and they go ahead. I have using this for last 2 years, I have uninstall the app."
"Whenever I order food from swiggy, delivery boy always late.I guess I have to uninstall swiggy! Coz there’s no better results"
Did not deliver my order .i paid in advance for order they changed my location and did not deliver my order even did not get any refund . wahiyaat ghatiya se v ghatiya service . dont use swiggy
Dear Friends this company is the one which works on fooling customer and making money in on other and if customer really faces an isssue they are not bothered to hwar him they have their set of predecided statements and in some cases they try to settle issue by giving partial payment like if your totall bill order was 118 then they will say sir are very sorry for trouble you face and for time being we would like to offer you Rs 28 back coupon .Sir will you like to take it or will like to our executive . Sometimes customer who is already fed up try to manage as he knows they wnt return he just let the issue go . But I had so many worst experience with the. and chat chatting which shows they even don't read what you are texting .
Worst app ever.. U can not cancel any order and if u do u will be charged of full cancellation fee.. I literally hate this app.. I wish i could give it a 0star
I ordered food at 8 pm. Even after 30 mins it is showing 40 mins for delivery. Hence I canceled the order through their chat. They have not taken the cancelation and the delivery agent has reached the place at 9.10 pm. Upon checking on the same chat thread after 10 mins they are responding with a 100% cancelation charge. How pathetic service it is. Their issue of not taking the cancelation and delayed delivery they charge the customers. Horrible time required even to reach the customer service team.
I live in a gated community. The delivery guy called on my number which I cud not pick up. He took this as a loop hole and went away with my order. He did not contact the guard room of my society knowing that the customer lives there. Swiggy cancelled my order n took the billing amount also. This is how they r managing their budgets. On the other hand one day zomato gave me a credit of a billing amount in my wallet coz the order got delayed. This is the difference in professionalism.
"Hello, i never encounter any ordering site which has this pathetic service, and ever after 1 hour long chat and call they were not ready to refund my money. i have paid 470rs and now they are giving me coupan worth 200 rs to shut my mouth and they just took my rest of the money without any service .  i had chat with shalini and the contact number they used is 913368205600."
"I used swiggy for 3 times, and everytime the service goes to new low. This time was the height, so thought to comment on social media. Oven Store pizza delivered in a smashed way. Complained to swiggy customer care, but they too were pathetic. I will never ever use swiggy henceforth, uninstalled the app now."
"Order that was placed, was not delivered. Reason: Delivery guy met with accident and food is not in condition to be delivered. Customer care - re-order the same food from same restaurant and within 6 min guy picked up the food but didn't move vehicle from there. after multiple follow up and 45 min later, he moved the vehicle and again I was told that food cant be delivered as delivery partner met with accident. OK. Swiggy refunded the amount in form of coupon. I used the coupon to buy sweet and that came out to be smelly and rotten. Now Swiggy will refund the amount only what was paid by cash/card not by coupon[ coupon was against my pre-paid order that was not delivered."
"Worst ever , I ordered food for 130 for 2 idly but sambar was not gud and moreover food was too cold when I received I felt it is cooked last night. Totally it was not worth . Too expensive to oder but no worth , not up to the expectations."
Very high cost. There is no benefit of applying coupon here . I prefer other apps they are better and affordable with quality foods options.
"Uncooked food delivered, uneatable  I had to throw away the food, swiggy shut me by just sending a 50 rs coupon, i mean that much i paid for the delivery.  All order money and food wasted, no one heard the complaint after several emails and calls.  Bad bad experience."
"I recently changed my phone and gave my old phone to my mother, where in my mother's credentialswere logged into the swiggy app. I tried logging in to my account using my credentials in the app on my new phone but I got an error message stating that my number and email are already in use from 6 months by another user. When I raised a complaint with swiggy I got a reply saying my credentialsdo not exist in their system. And today I get a call saying that this is a k own issue and I have to wait for 6 months to log in through my credentials. This is extremely preposterous. Their technical team even after knowing there is such a glitch has not come up with a solution and just ask their clients to wait for 6 months. Extremely disappointed."
"I have ordered the KFC, but the taste is not all KFC. And when I asked the bill, then they told that you will get bill from Swiggy only not from KFC. Then I called to KFC customer care to enquired the same . They told we don’t have any information related to the same when I asked about order .  So completely fraud by Swiggy, what I ordered that is not at all from KFC restaurant.., ,  This is one of the way to cheat the people...  If they really want to earn the money they can do any other things but not on food.,  I am not at all suggest/ recommend to order the food through Swiggy...."
"I wanted to send a gift to someone for Diwali. I selected some Haldiram Sweets, changed the delivery address from my home address as required by the app and paid for it. However, the app was giving directions to the delivery person for my home(default address stored in the app). On a phone call, the Swiggy person said that I have given wrong address directions and if I want a change then I will be charged and anyhow they can not deliver to the address I have entered because they do not cover the area(outskirt of Gurgaon). How is all this the customer's fault - the customer input information as required by the Swiggy app!  There are two flaws in the app for which the customer is being blamed:    The app should first confirm the address for delivery and let the customer select products available in the vicinity of the delivery address from where Swiggy can deliver.    Do not allow a customer to give a delivery address which Swiggy does not cover and of course not make claims of covering practically everywhere in India on their website!      I HAVE DECIDED TO NEVER ORDER ON SWIGGY AGAIN!"
If you ran out of money just ask her for donation or bhik mangalo B.C will give you . Don’t steal the money.
Its heart breaking to experience Swiggy's failure to resolve any issues. They have fallen from the sky high.They say only 'sorry for the inconvenience' & no other solution & you will have to loose money ordering with them.No wonder if they closedown closedown soon .
It's a shame for any food App like Swiggy who claims to give good quality food. HINDI MEI BOLU toh 10 mei se 8 order jo MUJHE delivered Hui Woh ya toh thanda THA ya Sada hua THA. Inke pass koi customer care service bhi nahi hai. Matlab KI Koi sunwai nahi. I must say never order from Swiggy.
Please customers don't oreder in swiggy  This is a very worst experience with swiggy so don't order on swiggy..go with other food online oreder so please don't order on swiggy
Dishonest customer service. Standardized responses. No real solution. Services not worth the money spent. Drivers are pathetic.
"If you cancel food items be careful because not clear refund massage. Immediately you loose money. Fake review, fake food photos and over prize. Best don't bye foo from swiggy. Go with other best app."
"Today I had one of the worst experience from any online food app. I order something which should have been delivered in 45 mins, however they took it more than two hours to confirm that it can't be delivered. I got three calls from them, first within 45 mins of ordering the food that delivery executive is having some issue with his bike and they are assigning someone else, then they called me again within half an hour that next executive had also faced similar issue and they are assigning someone else who will deliver it within next 10mins. After that I waited for another 45mins and the call came stating that the order can't be delivered."
"I order on swiggy n they don't able to deliver with in one and half hour . I can't understand if swiggy has not proper rider to pick the order then why he work in this field , I saw many other negative review in Ludhiana for swiggy , I suggest to Ludhiana viz that not use this app for ludh"
I have deleted swiggy and request you all to delete it they are running a strategy these days where in they cancel the orders themselves by saying oh we tried to reach you and then don’t refund the money too.
The worst service and it's a fraud.. had credit card transaction but the order dudnt delivered in ahmedabad.. so try to avoid swiggy
Most horrible service experience of my life. Never ever try swiggy. They delivered food which was spoilt. Smelling bad. Had to throw it away. And they didn't refund money. And stopped listening to me by avoiding my calls.
Items found missing...when enquired they said it happens....n token advance of 40/ would be deposited in my account....  ...keep my hard earned money as a TIP....PLZ DON'T USE SWIGGY..  ..
They DO NOT know to handle a customer issue. I had ordered a non veg pizza and the restaurant sent veg pizza. Then I placed a complaint and re-ordered and again the restaurant committed the same mistake. Them they have replied stating that the picture I sent was not clear. How can I send a different pizza picture. They look the same! It's the matter of ₹100. But imagine how many customers they cheat with their poor customer handling!
"I have been using Swiggy since long and is preferred way to get restaurant food at home.  Specially when compare to restaurant's self delivery, Swiggy offers massive discounts and somehow generated addiction.  My last order was dated 15th October(proof attached)  I ordered a dish worth Rs 200 but after discount got it for Rs 118 only.  That is the major reason I like Swiggy.  Moreover, the staff has always been polite and professional baring one incident till now.  I highly recommend Swiggy as food agitator."
"I had the worst experience ordering from Swiggy. I never received my order nor any refund even after complaints. The delivery executive never called me to deliver and cancelled my order.  Worst Experience of my life. Please do not order form the SWIGGY APP, it is a total wastage pf your time and money."
"Swiggy assigns multiple orders to single delivery person. During working hours, if you have placed an order based on Delivery Time, you are bound to be disappointed as there will be imminent delay. Also, unless cold items are orders, further disappointment due to Cold Food."
"Just an advice. Swiggy you realizes right you are guys are there in every galli nukad and major cities. Now imagine having a rowdy delivering to your door step. Yes guys that's what happened with me today.  Late night 10pm am ordered my pizza. Office stuff so was busy on call, I couldn't pick call for sometime. I agree my mistake. When I looked out I see this person waiting still with my order. I called him, 1st he argued with me. Agreed !! My mistake. I said sorry to him since I felt pity and bad about it. He comes down my house cancelled my order right in front of me and was show bad attitude, acted very senseless. He could have just given the ordered and maybe discussed with me. I could have helped him with a tip from my end for waiting.  Now here's the point half of bangalore working professionals work like what till 2am most of the days. Now when it's food we think swiggy and we order.  But guys beware I realised late night ordering swiggy isn't safe these people hire any random manner less people to do there job of delivery it is not safe to trust swiggy."
"Repost because I want other people to be careful of their hard-earned money.  I had the most horrible experience with swiggy. they are thieves and they don't even have good customer service. from the food, I ordered I did not receive half of my order. and instead of speaking for me to the restaurant, they tell me that it is not their concern. I'm sorry it is. they should have stood up, and instead of offering a total or even half refund, they offered 85 rupees for an 800 rupees order. the worst! spend your hard-earned money on another food delivery service."
I had ordered a pizza from Dominoes. The App showed order collected for delivery much before it was actually collected. Also while tracking the order it showed delivered when it was actually delivered 25 mins later. No contact details of delivery man is provided by the Swiggy App to enable contacting him. Because I had paid online I was worried my order was received by someone else. Also my address was showing wrong in the tracking link. Overall a bad experience
"Swiggy is a cheater, its happened twice to me, IPA for the orders and somehow they end up cancelling it and I don't get a refund .the excuse given is that my phone was not reachable whereas the whole world is contacting me through out the day.my 10 year old was made to wait for an order for 50 minutes and then it was cancelled from their end , no refund , no nothing.i am uninstalling this cheater app, and would advise people to avoid using it"
"I placed an order to swiggy today but have not received it.  Firstly the delivery boy who was coming to deliver the order spilt the food then one of the swiggy executive called me and said that he is replacing the order and I don't have to pay for the order.  Now when the replaced order came, the delivery boy was asking to pay. I called the customer care and one of the executive said I have to pay for the order. I told him that I have already paid for it but he didn't listen to me, on the top of it he was very rude to me. He cancelled the order. I had to return back the order which was their at my doorstep.  Again when I called customer care, executive said that I didn't have to pay for that order then I asked for resolution. Now the executive gave me a coupon of Rs 125 which was half the money that I paid for my order.  I don't understand if swiggy customer care executives are not able to handle the customer problems then why you guys are expecting the customer to order from swiggy.  I will make sure that me and my friends and family doesn't order anything from swiggy from now on.  Pathetic customer service"
"It is not recommended to use a very very bad service, please, if you want to keep your position, please strictly manage your shipping manager. The delivery service turned off its phone.  Too long wait and I had to cancel my order and stayed hungry for the rest of the evening."
Why can't you people make a strick rules so that your rider Cary deliver bag along with them we pay money for packaging charges and what ever extra charges you make this riders slowly eating your business
"I have been a regular customer. I ordered more than 500 times. hey were good initially but then, after having the monopoly, they started stealing. I ordered food worth 650+, delivery boy was lost somewhere and called me, I started telling him the way and he said that this is not what our app shows. He literally said ""Petrol nhi lagta hai kya?"". He denied duty. I asked support, had a chat for couple of hours and few calls. They said that they will refund the money in 14 working days. I checked it after 20+ days and didn't receive refund. I checked back with support and they said Sorry for inconvenience and they will make sure that this doesn't happen in future. I asked about refund and they kept repeating same. Finally, I didn't get the money. That day, I and my friend slept hungry and they stole our money too."
I’ve had the worst experiences with swiggy so far . The management department is extremely careless when it comes to confirming your order and checking the sound delivery of it . There have been times I had to cancel my order after hours of waiting only due to the carelessness of the management. This tends to show they don’t really value the customers time or money.
I recently ordered food around 12 in the night and it was supposed to be delivered in 27 minutes but it wasn’t. The app showed the food delivery guy collected from restaurant but not moving from that place for more than 1 hour. Then I asked customer chat team about the status and said they too don’t know and they can cancel and refund the amount. This was the pathetic experience that I faced when am am hungry hoping food will be delivered in 30 mins.Thought never to order from Swiggy again as the customer help team is not so kind to help customer.
"Hello Friends  Mostly of you have heard or have ordered food from Swiggy. Well I too ordered the same due to to discounts and offers they were proving at first place.  However, I regret now why I wasted money on this site instead ordering the food directly from the outlet or through other apps like zomato, UberEats etc.  Basically the incident was of 17th june, 2020 after the lockdown, I used the platform to order some starters and main course from a nearby restaurant which is very famous in that area. However when I was finished up with my selection, I was shocked because they had out Rs.100+ taxes and charges on thst order which was way too more.  No discounts and offers could be availed and the same costed me around Rs 1100 which is way too costlier if I got the same things physically in the restaurant.  The deliveryman was late, food not properly packed and why the hell do they they ask map location of delivery in their app, if deliveryboy has to call you every single time when you place a order stating, "" sir I can't find you! Could you give me directions? "" So annoying! Isn't it?  So yeah, thst was my experience from Swiggy  Let me know your reviews in comment section  Thanks for reading my review."
"It was a paid order. The delivery boy marked the order as Delivered however the order was not delivered. I contacted customer care and they showed no concern over it, however kept telling me they will look into it and take necessary actions. This happens at night 9.21 om and there was no response untill next morning 10 am when I messaged back about it. Please be weary when you place orders with online payment. This delivery boy was Hemant Chavan .... he said that I had asked to mark the order delivered without actually delivering it .... I mean who does this ??? Funny. But this is not the first time swiggy has played around with any order ... the attached image says delivered at 8.39 however the customer care said the order was confirmed delivery at 10.39.... I mean after two hours. They give multiple orders to the delivery  Person and then he drops my food package and I have to cancel my order they don’t even bother to reorder from their end.  Very poor service"
"Swiggy acts as a monopoly in this and very bad service , they take the orders and cancel them without informing customers and also they will not trabsfer the amount back in wallets and there is not customer service numbers if any problem with the order, they are taking advantage because no competition and also the etra surcharges are worst ( hidden charges are almost the 20% the order total swiggy has become worst ...."
I had ordered from KFC today at 7:50 PM and it is 9:50 PM right now which is two hours and they have still not delivered by order saying that the bike got towed once and they are speaking very rudely
"Today ordered evening snacks as I was Hungary all day long, busy so unable to cook but as the delivery guy unable to reach me on phone and not present near my location and they registered that he was on location and unable to reach me. Now I want to tell you that I am seeing him on map I doubt we why he was standing upto 1.5 km away showing 5 min to reach and telling he was on location. I want to tell delivery guy can't locate the address and he tried me but unable sometimes it happens, they mailed and SMS but i haven't checked it as I was seeing him on map free from any doubt that why he was standing at one place so much, until I could recognise they cancelled my order and I was put for penalty of 350+ by swiggy as a consolation for their partner( restaurant), because for such inconvenience. Now tell why I should suffer for all this."
"To  The head office  Swiggy  Subject : fraud delivery service.  I ordered food using swiggy app on 21st September order Id was (83767635753) and with COD payment option. I got a call from delivery boy that he was not getting the delivery address properly, so i guide them to reach the earliest. After some time I received my order by a Swiggy delivery boy and I handover the money to him then delivery boy told me to cancelled the order as there is connectivity issue so it was still showing that your food is enroute, but i denied to do. after few hours I got a call from Swiggy that you have cancelled your order and now you have to pay the particular amount or it will be a debit note in your Swiggy account, but i ignored it. Next day i open the app to order something but there was showing that you need to pay the previous cancellation amount as they had add an debit note in my account. The above scenario was explained to customer support team but there is no satisfactory response from them, they told me to send a mail regarding this scenario. So, i sent the mail to head office. But even after 72 hours i didn't get a proper solution, the debit note is still showing in my account. If your company has not found solution to such problems, you should not advertise your company and service so much. I strongly feel your company should have anticipated such types of problem. I'm not going to refer this app to anyone to order food as they don't have time to solve the costumers problem, and keep doing this type frauds. I hope you will look into the problem and do something in this regard."
Worst and unhygienic food handling and worst customer service never order the food from swiggy... if we say to replace the food they say we cant replace we can refund half amount or 100Rs coupon...u all can see in the pic how they deliver the food...and on that the delivery person says to plz adjust .... who will eat that kind of food during the covid time....
Hi plz dont order through swiggy the are not giving proper service. The delivery guys are open the pack and having the food.after we call customers care no response from them
"Bad services with delivery not on time... People are good &, genuine but taking to much time to locate and deliver"
"I ordered a dinner today through swiggy, they collected on time from restaurant and on the way delivery guy stopped for 20 mins and then delivered. Food was cold, unable to eat, swiggy help was not provided on time delivery help, guys use other services for delivery than these bugger swiggy. They even dnt cancel orders so that they eat money but no service.. how to eat cold roti?? Waste of my money.. Bloody buggers"
"I ordered food from a nearby restaurant for my 25th birthday and 30 minutes into my order I got a call from a number belonging to a swiggy employee (most probably the delivery executive for my order posing as someone else ) with all my personal and order details and asked for an otp which I had revieved on my texts saying that this otp is vital for the delivery of my food as the delivery executive for my order had picked up the wrong parcel and he needed this otp to reprocess and deliver my order , unknowingly I gave him the otp and realised in minutes that I had made a mistake and began speaking to the unhelpful and loopy customer care who just understood my problem and dint help me in whatsoever did not explain what might be happening right now, although the delivery executive showed up to deliver the food after about one and a half hour from me placing my order (the food was cold and inedible at this point). The delivery executive asked me weather I had spoken to the customer care and continued to say that my payment may not be processed and I would have repay him the money for the order through Google pay to his personal account since he picked it up from his money or asking if this is swiggy protocol he said there was a mistake , now checking the imagine of the executive provided on the swiggy app the person. Does not look anything like the image provided. After speaking and coordinating to swiggy officials for hours since yesterday like the guy promised I got an email saying that my payment has not been processed. I feel my personal safety and my family is compromised and swiggy has not really helped me or compensated me for my major inconvenience in any way . Will not ever order from their services and urge people to stop as well because if this happens to you they are not going to help you in any way. Attaching images of the ordeal which I also have shared with swiggy officials"
I placed an order with swiggy about an hour ago but i did not receive any delivery also i didn't get update abt the delivery I personally recommend not to use their services  Thank
The biriyani from Behrouz Madhymgram outlet is very very bad. Completely waste of money. Very bad experience.
I ordered food. Delivery man was not getting my location that's y he called me and I received his call every time but after some minutes they cancelled my order and they haven't refunded my cash also. That was so disappointing .
"I had Ordered 4 Artisanal curds Epigamia, but received 3 inplace of 4. When lodged complain with customer care, they don't respond. On chat they say send email to support email. They are cheating the customers. They are say we will forward your feedback to improve next time. What about the customer who is affected?"
"PLEASE Guys Don't order anything from swiggy becuase most of the delivery partner will not able be available..and the last solution you will get from the customer that "" shall we cancel your order"".  I wi suggest that order zomato.atleast you will not face this kind of issue...Swiggy is providing the worst service."
Most unethical and worst delivery criterias from Swiggy...i won't be ordering again.. very disappointed.they call you standing in front of your door and if by any chance u couldn't pick up for few seconds they cancel your order and charge you fine...even asking the agent to give the order and take the payment he refuses and take your order from front of you for which u waited more than one hour.
"This is reg order issue - the Swiggy delivery partner did not deliver the order. While handing it over to me it fell down on the ground and all biryani and other boxes fell down in front of my house. he took the boxes and thrown away, please check with the delivery partner on his number: 900898xxxx.  Its happened because bad packing, everything was pouring raita and gravy was spill over and bottom of the paper brown cover was completely wet. I got shocked and unfortunately I did not take the pictures. Now the delivery partner marked the order as delivered and the swiggy team is denied for compensation. He was clever and took away all the boxes and overs.  Then we called the customer are but rude response. I waited some time then no response then I ordered mani dum biryani(attached proof)  I have the below proofs.  1- conversation with the delivery partner regarding the issue  2 -delivary partner raised ticket- that proof  3 -My other ordered bill    Swiggy invoice     Lots of time waste, money waste, patience wait, my kids were hungry and had to wait long time and no food delivered. Please do the needful.  amount Rs, 504/-"
They provide worst consumer servies. Not at all userfriendly. Content is average not so good. It takes to much time to load. The price ( rate) of food is also high as per quantity they provide.serously like 400 600 700 its too much. During setting dilevry location too much error occurs related to locations. It takes wrong location. They dont even arrive on given time. While online payment its scam or fault dont knew. But after completing transaction they dont even give the surety of order placement. One get confused about it. And money gets cut down from the account.
"I tried to order a cake for a kid's birthday, the first transaction said failed so I tried again and the second failed as well, the third time it said the transaction was successful . But money was debited for all three times . They delivered the order and it was not opened . So I contacted swiggy for a refund and told them to take the extra orders as well, they refused to give a refund and kept saying as I received the order nothing can be done and I will not receive any refund.  DO NOT USE SWIGGY!"
"Third time that the delivery guy has vanished with our food, after we have paid by card and waited over an hour, hungry and tired. Swiggy is the worst app in the history of food delivery, with zero quality control over its delivery boys, abysmal standards of manpower, hiring cheap labour with no verification and absolutely no safeguards or mechanisms of ensuring delivery. They have no shame for this incredible lack of business ethics, not even offering full compensation despite repeated incidents. This is the last time we order from Swiggy, and we will make sure we write this review everywhere possible so others know their story is the same as ours. You should be ashamed of yourselves, please shutdown your business at once."
I have ordered pizza from swiggy and I got it very hot and fresh within the time I loved it and it's mouth watering .
"Am very disappointment, irritated, feeling like ashamed on myself choosing swiggy while was I starving. I ordered and by mistake selected my work location as delivery address but after knowing the address I started looking for option to change delivery address the minute I placed order but no use as there were no options. I started chat with CSR and he/ she made me to talk for half an hour with no solution. My only request was just change my delivery address and charge me extra but then cancelled my order kept the whole money as cancellation charge.  I value every penny I earn but this organization has made me feel weak. I would have been more spending that amount to any poor if I didn't get to eat but they fraudulently took my money. My humble request to fellow customer please give a thought to this before ordering from swiggy. You will find other apps like zomato or many other better than this. I have long chat with me which I will share with u as a proof. Feel free to reach out to me 831096xxxx. Thanks Other chat screen I have with me. consider my review seriously."
"I had the worst experience at Swiggy. I ordered 6 items out of which 2 were missing. The delivery man told me to contact Swiggy executive as he couldn't do anything. I called the Swiggy executive through chat box but he just apologised and mediated that he could give me a coupon of ₹120 (even though I had a loss of ₹230) and I would have to order again.Anyways, I had guests waiting at home and it was a disaster since I had to order again and the food came late again as usual. Not only did I lose my money, my guests had to wait for double the time for the food.  Never ordering food from Swiggy again."
I oredered food paid online. The order was cancelled and the full amount was taken as cancellation charges . The reason was the delivery boy could not contact me as he had no network coverage. Fraud and cheat people. If I had opted for cash on delivery he would have come to my door step and delivered. Its Arrogance on part of Swiggy to take away all money paid citing false claims. LESSON LEARNED: OPT FOR CASH ON DELIVERY.
"My order is cancelled by them and charged ful amount as cancellation charges,  rubbush service and fooling people with cancellation charges  I have never received cal from delivery boy for pick up of delivery and directly received a msg of order cancellation  I will escalate this matter  please dont order from swiggy its fake and fooling customers  bycott swiggy"
The cancellation policy has been designed so that no customer can get the refund even if the order is delayed. The help desk chat service is also poor.
"I can’t believe why I keep ordering from swiggy inspite of pathetic service.. tonight order dinner for 580 bucks.. no food.. delivery guy says it’s delivered. Customer care says send an email. Is this shitty joke  A week ago I order sweets for office, except 2 packets on top some cheap quality sweets not in the menu comes.. answer we will get back !!! Shameful"
"Swiggy is a fraud company, everybody please cancel your account in swiggy and dont order from them.  They will charge your card, but wont deliver food"
Last night I was order the food from swiggy around 11:40 pm they shows me time for 55 mins nd around 12:43 I got a call from swiggy that your order will be delay by 10 mins and again after 15 mins when I called them they told me we don't have any riders so we cancel our order we are not delivering the food it's around 1am they cut the call after that I tried a lot to contact with them but no one pick the call even I got a fraud call from swiggy who need my transaction details nd number these people also belong from swiggy they just want to steal the money from your account. Worst service I have never seen.. Even I don't know about my amount whether I get it back or nott.. I will file a case against them in consumer forum..
We ordered food from swiggy and waited for so long.suddenly got a message that the order got cancelled and 100% money is charged as cancellation amount. This is not the way to treat customers. The delivery executive dint enquire anything and just cancelled the order.
"Hello Swiggy team, today i order veg thali + veg roll + fried rice. i received food in very bad packaging. the food was melt together in thali including raita, rice, roti, shahi paneer, dal makhni all mixed together. So, how can anyone eat? the food was smelling, burn and uncooked also. fried rice quality was very very bad. i never eat such bad food in my life from any hotel or restaurant. Street food is more better than the food that i received today. you can check pictures for food quality and packing images. See rice quality and uncooked and burnt and thali food get mixed. please check images that i have shared. But, Swiggy not accepting and giving me discount coupon worth rs. 42. I denied that, because that not appropriate action and solving customer issues."
Very bad experience with swiggy they unable to refund the money bullshits never order with swiggy they make us fool ????
"The service is extremely poor and zero management.  I didnot, at all, like the service. They don't even respond to our problems properly. This is not expected."
"I had some guests at my place and I ordered food from Swiggy. Order was picked up in no time but it was never delivered to my place. On contacting the customer care, I was asked to wait for 10 min and thereafter another 10 min. The mobile of delivery boy was constantly switched Off. very difficult to get refund. will refrain from ordering food on swiggy, better go in for Zomato or ."
Its the worst service provider .there are always issue for order cancellation and payment issues from the swiggy side.
The delivery boys are very unprofessional and rude. They are always annoyed for no reason. They behave as if they are favouring us. Swiggy app is unable to track online location hence most of the times its order is cancelled. I would highly recommend to use zomato as it has live tracking and very quick service with polite delivery boys and minimal calling which is totally opposite to swiggy. Hence as i have uninstalled swiggy u should also do it. Go for zomato??
I ordered food on swiggy and later cancelled the order due to some personal reason. They were charging me 165/- cancellation fee inspite of cancelling the order within one min of ordering. The had extremely bad customer service and weren't ready to listen to my condition at all.
Hello team myself manikanta. i completed my engineering in a stream of computer science. I am here to share a review about swiggy delivery app that i have found an bug in swiggy delivery app that is very important to fix it. contact me for bugs details. thankyou team
Such a bloody team. full of scammers. During lockdown they are using people money as their perks. its been 2 times that they don't deliver the order and give me the msg that they delivered. such a pathetic team. I want my money back or else I will go the consumer court for such harassment
I has ordered many times food from swiggy. I has ordered but I can't get good coupon codes and offers on my order. I think They should improve it
I had ordered from Corner House icecream at 9 pm and after a 45 minute wait the app told me that the order is delivered. I had been waiting at our gate and no order was given to me neither did I notice a delivery executive on our lane. It took me about half an hour to get an executive to chat about my complaint and then was told to make an email complaint. They gave me a phone number which was busy for 30 minutes and then I gave up. Very impersonal service. Still no response to my email. And ofcourse someone else is probably enjoying our food order. Very dissatisfied with their service.
Swiggy is now overcharging than its competitors price comapred are high. Even if they give discount it still higher.  Offering 30% off still fod charges are high.  The restaurant enlisted are not upto to the mark.  The coupons offered will not go by your budget a single person needs to buy 1k to get a coupon applicable. Or minimum 250  Overcharging very often  Delivery executive are polite and delivers on time.  Customer executive are hopeless when they will make us wait and let suppoose while the respond if we are 3 min late they disconnects the chat.  Overall m not satisfied
I ordered a cake for my friend to his address by the guy said the address is mine I checked lots of time the address is mentioned her...I complaint to swiggy customer care executive the executive said don't worry will be deliver the cake to your friend's addressI was tansion free by
"Bake ur day, Thane.  Due to Lockdown in several areas of the city, getting a customized cake at your doorstep is a bliss!  Thanks to Bake ur day for making it possible.  Bake ur day has 7 outlets in Mumbai, you can order from any of them on zomato.  I tried the Triple Chocolate Terrain Chocolate Cake and it did taste super delicious.  The cake was freshly baked with all the precautions taken by the baker.  The design of the cake was very pleasing and superb.  The cakes here are available at pocket friendly and affordable prices.  Taste - 5/5  Design- 5/5  Delivery- 5/5"
"Ordered through swiggy in freshens hyper market, velachery.. but delivered with wrong product and lost some money in the transaction... when approached swiggy they didn’t care saying next time it won’t happen. When searched for the shops contact number there’s nothing.."
"Dear Sir,  This is to inform you that we have ordered two fried rice from a place through SWIGGY.  Very honestly saying that we never had this kind of experience ever.  the food is like red colored mashed chinese Kichdi with 5 gms of minced fried chicken.  Cost @120/ Portion  Quantity - 350 ml silver foil container.  now the question is that no restaurant can serve this kind of food, anywhere in Guwahati and now we are very sure that this must be from some roadside thelawala or any that kind of place, which swiggy never mentioned clearly on the page. Rating of Consumers are there for the food, the deliver boy or the service rendered but there is no grading of restaurant from swiggy so that people will understand, where from they are ordering the food or whether they should o0rder or not or from where to order.  now the question arises how clean and hygienic they are?  do you guys, check?  I am very sure you don't, and being a hospitality consultant I have been serving hospitality sector from decades but never I have seen either swiggy or zomato is coming down to any restaurant to check the SOP.  Sir, to be very honest with you we are not on the days where we can ignore all these matters, random checking is mandatory from your end, also please try to have some guidelines or restaurant screening process before taking on board. Don't just focus on generating revenue anyhow, try to understand that human health hazard will ruin your or can ruin your entire setup.  So be careful and do the needfull.  Name of the Restaurant from where we have ordered is - WASSALAM  Hope you guys will take some pain to go and see  Order Day - Friday, 14th August, 2020  Timing - 15:00 Hrs  Bill Amount @240/-  Thank you."
While joining swiggy I asked my officer about any amount deduction after starting my work apart from starting amount 600. He told me there is nothing. Now last 2 weeks 550+550 deducted from my pay as security deposit. No customer care contact number for delivery partners and I tried to contacted through mail. issue not solved. no proper response from them. Dont know how many people got cheated like this.
I placed a order pizza and after 1 hour he call and told me your order is cancelled bcuz you enter wrong address and I m used ZOMATO for the same address and now swiggy not refund my money also.
Money refund follow ups and their continuous apologies was just time waste. Better I go myself and get what I want. Also Stay hungry as order didn’t go through. Time also lost. It was between office lunch time. My family also stay hungry as I got busy in office work post lunch time
Super fast delivery. Food is very testie. I am very happy.this is osm food delivery website.really is fast delivery
I have placed an order from one of the restaurants and when I received the food I found out that the restaurant has sent me half the order. I informed the customer service and demanded 50% refund. I didn't even ask a full refund. And then they refunded me 1/3rd amount of the missing food. Totally disgusting service.
"Worst food, I ordered khamari roti and they gave me tandoori roti. It was hard to chew.  It has happened twice that I ordered khamari roti and they make tandoori roti and say it's khamari roti charging 25 plus tax"
"Swiggy's new money laundering scheme...  Hi All, swiggy has started new money making scheme by cheating on it's users.... I stopped using it for a while, however tried giving it a try today by ordering from it for Rakshabandhan and again the same old story repeats, I placed the order, money was debited and no order was placed.  On complaining their ever slow team came up with the response that the money debited is not captured in their tool and they asked me to wait for 5 working days.  This is the 5th or 6th time I am facing this issue... now after five days it often happens that we get busy with our work and forget checking on the amounts and it remains in Swiggy's account for ever, unlike zomato who process the refunds immediately...  It happened with me quite a number of times with Swiggy and now I chose not to let it go coz if it happens with me it might happen with so many of you...  I am also providing you with proofs... please stop using swiggy..  Acct XXX696 debited with INR294.00 on 03-Aug-20 and SWIGGY8@ybl credited.Info:UPI-021622510792.Call 18002662 for dispute or SMS BLOCK 696 to 9215676766"
"I don't know why this application even exists. Everything about it is just frustrating. Starting from the number of options made available to the users, to the customer service. Delivery staffs are rude, mannerless. I have no idea whether the team behind it is even doing anything to make certain changes and restore the quality of the service. Utterly disgusted."
This is my first time when i called to swiggy customer care executive and he is abusing me for the same what i am not expecting to be treated that really rediculous still i am sorry to uninstall the app from now onwards
Swiggy is very good for order food online from nearby restaurants and get food deliver in few minutes. Swiggy provide app for android and ios platform with good user interface and easy to use. Swiggy app provide restaurants menu list items with image and review so its easy to place order food items. Swiggy food delivery service is very good and fast.  What I dislike about Swiggy is that Swiggy food packaging is not good some restaurants packs food with seal but some restaurants are not. Also we cant place food order at the same time from different restaurants.
This has been consistently observed that the swiggy boys avoid deliveries citing reasons that the ordered items are not available.When asked to connect to the manager/owner they say your order is confirmed. We are delivering ....after an hour when checked.they again say items are not available.
"I have an ordered from swiggy using website, I have mentioned the delivery address for that location. its my fiance birthday and I was out of that location I thought swiggy will delivered my food to that location. I had ordered chocolate cake worth rs 500, chicken pizza, chicken hot dogs and many more for her birthday. my fiance and her family was waiting for cake and foods after 30 min of waiting the delivery boy got foods and went to that location and called me and I answered him you have to delivered on that location but he was not giving his effort to find out the location, its a first call of me from him, and after that I have called to my fiance home and told them they had to picked up the food the delivery boy cant find out yours address then I called him and said somebody is coming to picked food then suddenly my call was cut. and I repeatedly call him but call hasn't connected and after 5 min I have seen on swiggy account ""Your Order has been cancelled."" I shocked, what happened, its my fiance bday and she waiting for cake and and I was watching this message on the screen. suddenly I have contact to customer care and complaint on it they told me your not responding thats why we cancelled your order, I told them have called so many times but his phone not connected and he was never called me again just 2 time he was called me, but customer care doesn't respond properly, I beg from of them please dont do that to me its my fiance bday and shes waiting for cake, thed didnt care of that, they cant understand the feeling and emotions, I told them so many times pls regenerate my order but they haven't do that and not a replacement policy and not return policy. I was lost my fiance bday because of swiggy . I throw out the money in water, and their delivery boy enjoying my fiance bday cake and lots of foods. I have uploaded my calling things on swiggy on that day pls checked out if you guys thinking I am lieing. I hate swiggy and its services, very bad experience, guys pls stay away from swiggy they dont understand your feelings, emotion and money. they just cancelled orders and feed them to their delivery boys."
Absolutely bad service as they cancel order due to wrong items being picked up..delivery boys don't handle food products with care.
This app connects all the waste restaurants in cities and deliver us useless food.  Even dogs won't eat such kind of dirty food.  Please govt must ban this app.  Never expected such waste food.  Quit it .  Do not install this app at all.  Save money.
"Swiggy can't do the refund process and it is robbing to their customers, I haven't been able to get my refund for 15 days even I remind many times. I request you all, never order from swiggy, it is worst service ever."
The app is indeed giving quick services but cheats alot in terms of taxes delivery charges.inspite of giving delivery charges tips n taxes they on top are charging surge fees...this takes ur bill far high.their menu rates are also high then those in respective resto menu.they wat are they charging so much for.i will not recommend this app.  These menu rates are also different from those in the
"Poor and unprofessional, anytime in BTM zone and your order anytime can we cancelled and when you call customer care people no resolution. only repeated message and sentences.  I have un-installed swiggy app"
Swiggy is the platform to place order and they do not take ownership of what happens.  I added clear instructions on the app ans still the supervisor says they can not take the responsibility. I had paid for the order and now I cant even eat.  They are insensitive. Why should ppl order from there when they can take responsibilty. Dunzo is better.
"Hello friends, Myself Ramanand Anand and going to share my personal experience on the food delivery Plateform ""Swiggy"".  So without any delay, let's come to the point:-  Whenever I need to order food online I only use Swiggy App.  But day by day their services and support team going poor and poor. Maximum times the delivery boy didn't deliver food on time even they delivered unfreshed or unsealed food packets and when I complainet to support team regarding this problems they didn't take any action . So overall experience was very bad if you thinking or planing to do swiggy on any occassion for delecious food then don't go for swiggy because they dont deliver food on time."
This is one of the worst app....they cheat people easily.....if we place the order and it wont deliver on time and they dont provide proper tracking id.....and if v place order from and complain about the food the fool us sayng the food you have ordered is 3rd party so we dont have direct contact wid them and give  bullshit answers....Frankly giving review about this app it is worst and they cheat easily and grab money from us plz dont order food frm this app instead chose other similar apps
Everything is fine. But what kind of delivery charges are these? Every order they charge min 50rs delivery and taxes extra. Sometimes i see they also include packaging charges. Seriously man. This disappoints me big time and feel like not to order but yeah you can smile and laugh that we also feel like kaun bahar jayega better online kar do. But remember sooner or later someone will come and will take big advantage of your this drawback. Business always comes from these issues only. And I would be very happy to leave you. Infact i have got many new online sources. I mostly use it for raw chicken but now Lucious has come.
This is one of the worst food delivery service that I have used. The reason why I am saying it's bad because it dosn't have anyone the qualities that a good delivery service should have.  Their delivery service too bad that rarely we get the order on time and also even after complaining about this issue they don't care at all. The offers they are providing are also not great compared to the ones that zomato is providing. The only thing is good about it is most of the restaurants are avaiable in swiggy. If you don't have any problem with the delivery time and the offers then go for it or else don't even think about swiggy for ordering food.
"Good Service, I had a complaint because of the order got delayed, however the rep from swiggy, her name is Shaista she took care of my complaint. She was prompt and efficient"
"Hi, it's been almost 5 years since I have using Swiggy to order food and initially the services were really good. So the thing is today I ordered Akshayakalpa milk & some vegetables from Swiggy grocery & I ended up paying 173/- bucks for 500 ml milk, 1 cauliflower & 1 packet of curd which costs 10 bucks. So here are the points how they are clearly cheating the consumer and trying to make money by fooling the public:    The milk originally costs 35 Rs and this is the market price for Akshaykalpa organic regular milk but swiggy has charged 44 Rs for the same which is 9 Rs higher than the original price.    Cauliflower is available at Rs 10/- in Big Basket & hardly 20 Rs on the store but Swiggy charged 55 Rs for the same      Also I have been to most of restaurants from which I generally order the food and swiggy always charges about 20 Rs extra on each product, which will generally be cheaper and on top of that delivery & packaging charges.  I am writing this review after a thorough comparison of the rates from a physical store/restaurant and other delivery partners.  Once I had made a complaint to swiggy on the rates & I got an answer that mam I have given you 10% discount so it is arriving at the cost of restaurant. So they usually charge more and make money by fooling the consumers.  Other thing is if you cancel the order the money doesn't come back to you immediately, it takes 6-7 days to reach back to your account so they can keep that money with them and make some interest out of it.  I would definitely not recommend swiggy to anyone."
Update: I am pleasantly surprised to get a mail from Swiggy saying that they have examined the case and decided to refund the amount as it has been charged unfairly. This is the kind of response expected from a professional company. I hope Swiggy will keep it up and serve customers as per their expectations.  Thanks Swiggy!!  Original review: I ordered food online and typed delivery address. The app on its own picked some random GPS location as address. The delivery guy calls after some time that he is at that particular location and can’t deliver food at my home. Customer care executive called but plainly told me that it’s my fault for which he can’t do anything. He cancelled the order without refund and robbed me of my food and money both.  Robbers!!
"They have changes to their so called policy were they themselves can cancel the order and don't even refund back using these new policies, their customer support really terrible on how they respond to the customer"
Very bad.cheating public with very high rates and making people lazy and eat junk foods. Cheating cheating cheating cheating cheating
Swiggy is the worst app ever worst ... if u want to b punished and loose ur money this is the app for u ... worst pathetic
"Thankfully, I dont received my order from Swiggy after trying for 30 minutes! I had placed the order from What A Sandwich at 11:45Pm which was expected to arrive by 12:30Am. The order didnt arrived.  To get my order, I tried to contact the rider but could not connect with him! The rider’s mobile number was switch off. I waited for half an hour but when nobody arrived, I contacted customer support! The customer support was not at all useful in this case.  I contacted the restaurant to get the status of my order. The manager at the restaurant told me that the order has been picked up. It is out for delivery. I told him that the rider is not reachable as the live tracking also stopped at the moment.  The manager had no answers to it. I asked him to provide me with a solution and he suggested me to contact Swiggy only.  However, Swiggy was of no help! After waiting for an hour, the The rider Call back from hotel and he said he is not able to deliver the food because the police don't allowed him to cross the area when I told him if police guy stop you you have to call me from there only I can come till there to collect my food.  But the rider is quite and he transfer the call to hotel manager and he also not helping me out with this.  Worst experience"
"Idk but this company should really re evaluate their staffs they have no consent and no sense of responsibility towards their business.  I hate to say it but its worst than any other delivery businesses around.  Our company wanted to partner with them last year on Sept,  called the customer care did the procedures.  Then this executive comes in all hyped a day on call then stops receiving calls no email reply.  Till today and then we recently called again for resuming the process and the again unattended.  I feel like an idiot calling them to know the status."
I clearly read the cancellation charges and cancelled my order before one minute but Swiggy charged me fully for the cancelled order. I could have rather bought my food instead of paying these guys free cancellation charges. Spoke to customer service who were of no assistance at all cause all they could do was give me only a coupon of Rs.200 which was not valid for more than a month and is not valid for full certain stores as well. Very disappointed with Swiggy. I trusted u guys for a long time and feel cheated today!
"Best app for food in india. Good service . Service charge and delivery charge is higher , but still is good app for food. Variety of food available in different hotel and restaurant. I would reccomend this to everyone."
I buy food from Swiggy rarely. Recently I have ordered food from Swiggy and my experience was horrible. First of all the GPS of the application is useless as it detects the address wrong all the time and I have to fill the details manually. And even when the rider comer with food the location is not perfect on the application.  I have ordered Amritsari Naan and Chole from of the restaurant of swiggy. The order delivered in 47 minutes. The delivery guy told me that the security measures are increased and it will take this much time from now.  When I opened the packaging the food was stale in nature. I have complained in the app buy they offered some Chillar as compensation and denied to return the order.  I have complained several times but no resolution provided. Finally dumped the food for cow and uninstalled the application. Feeling good now.
"Had an issue with my order, initiated chat immediately but no one responded. Tried again next day and no response. Finally managed to get hold of a customer support executive today but no help since the order was placed a day before, even though I had raised the issue immediately!! Uninstalling Swiggy!!"
Swiggy Services are so pathetic and even customer care services is so pathetic and they hired gundaas type of person who delivers and they don’t know how to speak.  Please avoid Swiggy and if you are facing the same problem then highlight as I am complaining about Swiggy in consumer form as well as in high court.  Thanks
I ordered food and they did not deliver. they cancelled it and did not refund also saying they could not contact me when I clearly mentioned them my alternate number. Plz never order from here. Looting people during covid-19 to make money  Govt shud take some action on these people
"Ordered on swiggy from Tandoori House ratings 4.9, which is exceptionally high, Order butter chicken safest dish, got timely delivery so something good.  Swiggy rating is a joke, to give Tandoori House 4.9, where top restaurants fight to get this high ranking, they work their asses out to reach 4.9 and I believe many are still far from reaching this position.  Swiggy have given this restaurant 4.9 and you can not find this gem anywhere else but on swiggy, Amazing restaurant that is not anywhere to be found on web and still 4.9 as per swiggy. if you disagree and from Noida, plz order and see yourself. It is cheap food pocket friendly but that's all about it, but when it comes to taste I will give not more than 1 because that's the lowest it can go.  Swiggy is promoting restaurant without showing true feedback from customer, I will never know if my review makes a difference on swiggy, This is unethical and Super wrong.  Anyone can say this not among top restaurants, many others who dedicate their life's to reach 4.9 don't mess up with simple butter chicken that even roadside dhaba with no experience can make better.. I though it is safest dish but they manage to f¢k this up as well."
"I order food from swiggy whenever want to eat delicious food. I ordered pizza recently, it is just.so yummy with reasonable prices."
"As I see, in few months ago my swiggy account taken for granted. I totally relay on swiggy kind of food delivering app. But swiggy is quite good then any other app. But by time as much as I need the service they always gave me dissatisfied in tones of order. They always create a bunch of issues might that related to the refund, unfortunate order cancellation, etc. Even though the executive they higher for delivery was denied. Now, I'm irritated by this behaviour. They serve for the user totally annoyed. Even the time they provide fluctuating accordingly."
"This has literally been happening to me for the 8th time, 9th time just now. I used to earlier call the restaurants to please sent change, however, a customer support person informed me that I can simply mention it in the comment section, and it should be relayed to the Delivery person. Well, THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED! Due to this, I am forced to give the Delivery person a huge tip on every order. The Delivery person pleads ignorance every time I lose my top on them, claiming that they have not got any such directions to carry change. What kind of a SCAM is this? Who is in charge of informing the delivery person that they have to carry change, specifically when told?"
"My daughter ordered 2 Kunafa's from Kunafa World Coles park, bangalore. The order came without the regular sugar syrup. When I called the restaurant they said they sent it. When I called swiggy they didn't care. It is like eating a dosa without chutney or sambar. I told the swiggy customer person about the situation, but they refused to send the syrup. What's the point of half orders"
"Hello everybody, I'll write a quick Swiggy review.  As food delivery app has been improving over a while, Swiggy remains one of the best for me. I've been an app user for over 4 years and so far, I haven't faced any problems with anything from any restaurant I put my order. Any time this is a plus point compared to other delivery apps, I got my order within 30 minutes.  I would just like to talk about Swiggy's pros and cons.  Pros -    The app and website are user friendly, a very good photo layout makes it look perfect.    Time to deliver.    Offers on the App and Website.    Delivery people are good, and soft-speaking.    Customer service is good too.      Cons -  I have only one problem with the Swiggy, that sometimes the delivery and packaging fees are very high at some restaurant."
Today I've ordered six packet Biriyani from this restaurant via #swiggy and they have delivered completely STALE FOOD.  I don't understand how could someone be so irresponsible to serve DECOMPOSED FOOD to their customers. They don't deserve even one star and should be punished.
When we are using it first time they give us lot of offers through it to buy food but now its taking too much charge.so now we are not able to buy food through it because of high charges.
"Today I had ordered to deliver few items from KFC. And the distance was around 5-6 Km from my house. And they took more than an hour. And there is no customer care contact number is available to reach.  And also I got some food coupons from my office and I had purchased 5 coupons and the website will allow us to redeem one coupon at a time. This is a high level cheating to the people. Invariably I have to use 5 coupons for 5 orders and pay for the delivery, distance fee etc., for 5 times.  I strongly recommend not to use this website for any orders."
"Pickup or Drop anything from anywhere in the city is a new service added during lock-down days in Swiggy App. Beware of these cheats as a service partner of Swiggy. They add more kilometres to your pick up and drop locations distance and charge more. In my case maximum 3.5 kilometres distance was charged for 10.5 kilometres. Moreover, they also charged IGST even when the service was given within the same city. As per rules IGST is only applicable for inter-state transactions. They did not give me an invoice with pickup and drop locations mentioned and the item picked up in the service availed. Simply put, in my opinion, this is a shady service cheating the public with exorbitant charges for the service taking advantage of the hardships of lock-down days. They are also illegally charging IGST for same city services. Are they paying the government this IGST charges collected from us? Questions are not answered by them. So, it is better that we avoid this service."
"2 days back i had placed an order through swiggy on cart, i received a call from there end stating 2 items are not availability, i said ok send remaing when delivery agent came to drop the veggies he said one product was not available u will get a refund, when i contacted swiggy they are saying they wont be able to give the refund for the missing items..really bad experience i have paid for something which i never received there customer service is worst...they are ripp off and fooling ppp around and making money .pls dont buy anything from swiggy"
Mohd hameed he is very good delivery boy he is good behaviour boy. his id 557527 i am impressed with that delivery boy
Please dont go with swiggy its worst to the core even they deduct our money and will not return soon and worst service by customer care department.
"It's number 1 food delivery service, and I have got my delivery on time in sarjapura road, the delivery boy has brought the food right in on time many times, thanks for your efforts boys."
After getting issue with service Swiggy solved my problem n gave solution immediately.Supportive executive.
Order was placed in yum yum cha through swiggy at 9:00 pm today on the 13th June....  At about 9:10 pm I get a text saying that there are some unavailable items on the order...  I was guided to a live chat.... and was assured my order is being processed and will be delivered shortly and that all is well with my order ....  Now at 11 pm I get a call that my order can't be delivered and refund would be initiated  Can i ask the swiggy people or the yum yum cha people should i eat my refund now??  Where should I get my food from??  PLEASE NEVER ORDEF FROM SWIGGY
"I had ordered for lunch in my office through swiggy. The service is totally bad, firstly the guy was late and later for change there was a big head ache. I tell you guys, very bad service and the food was completely chill."
"I eat out a lot and I was a regular customer of swiggy. they even gave a me a title VP of gastronomy, whatever the fck that is. Swiggy only pushes waste product, normally customers don't buy unappealing food when they go to a restaurant, but when you order online swiggy gets that unwanted, worthless items for customers for an extra price. Bottom line- Swiggy should be renamed to SHT, because that's what they are, period."
"Pathetic services. They send you different dishes with lesser amounts. And you order for safety? They provide you food with complete spillage issue. Asks you to upload the images and then does nothing except for apologies. What if something went I to that dish due to improper packaging or what we know if there delivery executive is eating that in the midway. Completely Opened food that too in this epidemic situation and these idiots says that we are providing best safety standards. Knuckleheads not even taking a single measure to protect us. They don't care if someone slept without food or empty stomach. Or someone have spent too much for the items. All they care is taking orders. Many of us don't speak, even I haven't spoken or reviewed this I kept ignoring. but now is the time I have had enough. Please stop ordering, take you family mates out with you on a dinner but don't order. Even there delivery executive stands in front of the door like a beggar for the tip and says. Kuch inaam do. Bhai agar khulle paise hote to de deta. Nahi h to kaha se lau. pathetic app.better to go restaurants all by yourself and take your dinner or take your family with you and get served hot food."
"I have been using swiggy for the past 5 years now and I have been more the satisfied with the mobile application as well as the service of Swiggy.The Mobile app is very user friendly, it is very simple and easy to understand also there are various features that I just love the chat feature that they have started so that if there is an issue with the order I can speak with the executive on the go also the order tracking system is very accurate also I get no errors on the maps as wellThe Mobile app is so convenient to use that even if I am away from my home I can place an order tell the time I reach home I have my food ready fro meI have never had any issue with the app or the serviceAll an all I am very happy with the service of swiggy."
"The company took my money to deliver an order from KFC. I ordered from KFC yesterday. Order number is #74441049577. I paid for add on as well. But to my surprise, I didn't receive any add ons(which includes 2 cold drinks, 2 dips, 8 sticks, 2 medium french fries). Swiggy says they cant give my money back for the items I never received!"
"Be careful guys. Swiggy’s a fraud  I ordered a couple of ice creams through Swiggy and paid for it. 45 minutes later I get a message that Swiggy’s cancelled my order and I’ve been charged the entire amount of Rs 1040. Why, because the delivery agent tried to call me and I failed to respond.  Truth be told, I did NOT get any calls from the delivery agent. Swiggy Customer care then ‘corrected’ me - the agent ‘tried’ to contact me but since my phone was busy he could not contact me and hence had to cancel my order. It’s not about the money but it’s about ZERO customer service and Swiggy sucks at it. Get that Swiggy, you suck. Period  You are ‘DELETED’"
"It's good platform for food delivery, but sometimes the quality of food is bad as compared to food. But the delivery is very fast so we can enjoy food in time."
Hi my name is Ishaan Sukhija my register mobile number is 9971991535 on 27 may I placed a order from swiggy and at the time on deliver ur executive told me the order was destroyed so u have to cancel it and nowtoday is 4 June I placed order and before 1 minut of delivery u guy told me your order was destroyed I am connecting all the screenshots even they does not pick my call this a behave and this is good will of swiggy please hire some educated people the same thing repeat in this week after this refund I m going to delete swiggy from my phone becoz your people are mentlity sick and I m going to post this on your social media account too  Becoz of covid19 u took money online and after that your delivery excutive run away with order .  Poor service  Ishaan Sukhija
I ordered a KFC for Rs 667 from swiggy at 0923pm. Estimated delivery b was in 32 mins. It never happened. KFC tells me that ordered was not placed. Swiggy has taken the money. Swiggy apologizes and asks to write an email. My family slept hungry. I curse and abhor swiggy.
I ordered a cake on Swiggy from Hangout cakes and more. (lokhandwala). Firstly the swiggy customer care called me due to they did’nt find my address on the app so informed thm the location is been already added on it thn y so problem thn she took me on con cal fr again clarity of the address i did a whats app again and shared my live location too bt thn also the delivery boy was unable to find the location and after so many call for him to guide my address I received my order and i was very much unsatisfied due to behaviour of the delivery boy FAIZAN KHAN he used abusing language also as i tld him to take this cake again to the cake shop bt he refused me and used vulgar language and ran away.

My Order no.#74242055379  Delivery boy. FAIZAN KHAN  MOBILE NO. 8454899452
Many things are good while ordering food from Swiggy but Cancellation policy does not meet the peoples expectation.
These people are no less than thieves. I ordered sweets worth 2000 later due to some reason I had to cancel my order. Swiggy took 1000 Rs as a cancellation fees.
"I had requested food from restaurants however after at some point they rang me and cancel the request. However, at the Swiggy app, it was indicating that the request is delivered. Presently I am catching them to give my discount. They have a regrettable client assistance framework. They are really badgering their clients. Swiggy is so much better. I would recommend everyone not to utilize Swiggy to spare themselves from cheating and mental agony"
"Placed an order with KFC via swiggy and paid 1200 bucks for my order.. Waited for 40 minutes for the food to arrive, but rather got a call from them that KFC never received the order.. To top it all, this is the second time that is happening.. The previous time this happened, u had to run after swiggy customer service for 3 weeks before I received my money back... I am not gonna order with swiggy anymore + will suggest people in my friend circle tooo to stop placing orders on swiggy.."
The biggest fraud and chor company...Do not ever take any service from swiggy....Worst attitude to sector 5 wow momo swiggy delivery boy... He is in rush with cheap behavior
They will not refund amount immediately. They will provide coupons. If you apply for order less than the coupon amount. The remaining amount will not be added back to your coupon. This is very bad
"The most exceedingly terrible situation is that they will acknowledge your request and neglect to convey for different reasons. At long last they will encourage us to drop the request for half of the bill sum, and that is the main alternative you have. Individuals be careful you will lose your half of the bill sum simply like that, nor you will get the food. You will starve and get baffled. Accomplish something, however not Swiggy."
I am trying to contact so many for swiggy service(Food) but then dont give exact solution. Very bad experience with swiggy many times. Their chages are very high. They are cheating us. Really don't belive this fraud company.
"Ordered a biriyani meal after the hard covid work n all I got is rotten food n when I ask for refund they say they cannot help with it ?????????????? I literally paid for spoiled food. I am really in tears not cz of the money but after hard working day in this lockdown, all I get is this."
"In these times of lockdown they insist on prepayments and do not deliver your food. They claim they called you and since you did not respond hence your order is cancelled and money is not refundable. Bid fraud being perpetuated on customers, please be careful and do not place orders through their website. This has happened with an order placed by my daughter tonight only she lost more than 1300 rupees but was left hungry at 10.30 pm. Our experience with Zomato is much better so please refrain from ordering through Swiggy. In case you need further details please contact me at 9810060899."
"The worst scenario is that they will accept your order and fail to deliver for various reasons. Finally they will advise us to cancel the order for 50% of the bill amount, and thats the only option you have. People be carefull you will lose your 50% of the bill amount just like that, nor you will get the food. You will starve and get frustrated. Do something, but not Swiggy."
"Hello, friends  My name is Shivam, and I am going to give my personal and honest review upon Swiggy what I experienced about swiggy and what I like and what I dislike but one thing I tell you that my exprience is not good with swiggy.  Moving Further, i was hungry and I don't have food then I think to order food online with swiggy and then I downloaded swiggy application in my cell phone and I see many tasty food which was look very tasty in pictures finally I choose chicken biryani from red apple hotel of Sangrur Punjab.  The application start to track my order and this is the very good feature of swiggy application a delivery staff was appointed for me to deliver my chicken biryani it takes maximum 20 minutes form to red apple hotel to my residence but the trouble begins now after 30 minutes delivery boy called me for the confirmation of address and order and he told me that he was on the way 5 minutes take to reach my residence after 10 minutes I was tried to call delivery boy but he didn't receive the call of mine after 10 minutes he called me and said where are you I am in your street, then finally I received my package but when I opened it the chicken biryani is totally become cold and I don't want to eat it the delivery boy takes 50 minutes to deliver the package and my money was totally wasted.  I hope guys my experience with swiggy will help you to select the right decision  thank you."
"Do not order from swiggy the way the delivery boys speak was rubbish and the refund they have provided to me was half amount I paid them 269/- inr and the refund was 134/-only seriously no one should order swiggy Its very cheap seriously they providing ""actually the thing is I have order from Mc""dona ls the paneer spice rape its cost 269/- inr and delivery will get the proper address so before coming to me gave him a call he told me ya its ok and after picking the order he was talking was rubbish way and he did gave me the order also and my refund was also half provided to me very bad and cheap serious was provided to me so don't order from swiggy guy""s"
"I wish I could give minus ratings to this commercial app. Swiggy has lost its genuinity. I ordered 1000 Rs. worth food from Paradise hotel in Hyderabad and 3 years old kid used the phone and by mistake canceled the order. They looted 500 Rs. The order has been cancelled within one minute of the order placed. The delivery boy might not even had gone to the Paradise hotel neither they must have prepared the food within one minute. They should understand customer's issues and should refund the amount. It is a useless service and the staff who deal with the Swiggy call centers are also useless who only show the technical limitations without understanding the patient's problems. My 500 Rs. just got wasted and they took more than two weeks to refund another 500 Rs. One thing Swiggy should remember is that, their business won't run without customers. And they can't keep taking advantage of customers necessities. It's better not to rely on Swiggy. I uninstalled the app and suggested the same to the people around so that, they don't get cheated like me. Quite a few times, the delivery boy had gone to the wrong address and didn't even turn up. We waited for two hours and all the way had to go out to the hotel we have ordered from on my Dad's Birthday. Services of Swiggy are very commercial and customers plz give a second thought before you install this app."
Delivery charges are too high....  They are 75 rs to 100 rs for delivery as well as tips for delivery person.....  Charges should be reduced.
"Please do not order from Swiggy. I order RS 750 and later cancelled and they deducted Rs 374.  Swiggy app took wrong address, I asked to change the address and come to new address but denied  Looks swiggy is doing forgery and looting money from people in covid situation.I would urge people to take care and not order from swiggy else they will loot giving any nonsense reason.  deliberately the app will pick wrong address and they will do forgery."
"It is an worthless food ordering app.The application sometimes crashes which causes hindrance while ordering food.Their cancellation process is inefficient, even if you spot the app's bug and try to cancel the next moment, you wont'be able to cancel the order and you will be charged exorbitant cancellation fee.The application does not properly categorise your food options which are annoying.Most of the Items on swiggy are overpriced compared to restaurant and their delivery charges also very high.Food options on swiggy are less comparatively to zomato and uber eats.Some of the limitations of ordering food on swiggy are as follows.  1) .DELIVERY TIMELINESS - Most annoying or dislike thing about swiggy is delivery time.They are taking too much time to deliver foods.Sometimes they take almost 2 hours without giving proper reason and proper support which is very hateful.  2) .SERVICE - Their service quality is very bad.Their delivery boys are unprofessional, sometimes they behaves very harshly with the customers.It is very difficult to reach out to their customer executive, If you have an serious issue, you cannot reach them easily as their online numbers are wrong.  3) .They charges high amount as delivery charges, They does not offers free delivery everytime, swiggy only offers free delivery with no surcharge only when the order value is more than 99rs.  4) .There is no option to change your location after placing an order.The only option which will be left with you is of cancelling the order.  5) .They will always delay your order.They never delivers orders on time.  6) .Sometimes the swiggy app gets slower, so it becomes very difficult to place an order on swiggy which irritates you a lot.  7) .Their customer executive are very professional, There is no way to have an direct conversation with their service team, which is very disgusting and hateful.  8) .Sometimes they does not offers cash on delivery option as payment methods on many items, so if you have no option for online payment you cannot place an order of your choice on swiggy.  9) .I strictly recommend and prohibits every individual not to prefer swiggy."
"Swiggy is charging you with overpriced items and other additional fees during this tough times on the name of lockdown due to COVID 19. You as a customer left with no choice place your order with a faith that atleast even though you are paying more than usual you will atleast receive the adequate qty n quality for it. However, that's not the case during this course of lockdown many vendors are cheating you either with bad quality (stale or old), in appropriate Qty or both.. at times they send you things other than you have placed the order for. Now when you will knock the CS they have only one verbiage that we are sorry and will make sure nothing like this will ever happen again. However it's happening again and again and now when you want them to compensate on your hard earned money you have lost for all the above issues they have only one thing to say. Sorry our policy does nt allow is for any compensation we can only place an apology for that. How can you cheat the customers like that on whose behalf you are running bur so called business. Someone need to do something here."
This is my first order from swiggy I hv order some dry chicken but insted they gave me some chicken curry but then I try to contact SWIGGy executive they r offering me a coupon of 50 rd wn I hv ordered for 165 rs they won't gavey money back and they didn't re orderd it ....!!! It's such a fraud company
"There are many time I ll share feedback from last mile Delivery but still no improvement the Delivery boy behave like from local tapori....also today I m order food I m request to Delivery boy I m by mistake add my other home address. Both are address different between like 5 minit but Delivery boy told may nai aaunga tumhe aana he to aau nai to may ye order return restro leke jata hu.. when I m asked for name then he told aap dek lo aap may may nai bataunga jau jisko batana he usko batav... very pathetic service from swiggy.com..... I really do not order again from swiggy. Also I ll share feedback to my friends, family & outsider people..."
"I have been ordering from swiggy since 2016. Once in a while there will be bad food , or an item missing and they have always been prompt in either refunding the amount or replacing the item. Yesterday I ordered 6 items from mainland China for 2798 rs - of this only 4 got delivered. Of the 4 one item was wrong and one was undercooked. After raising this with them over several mails they have promised to take strict action against the restaurant and have given me a 500 rs refund which covers 1.5 missing items. I have battled with their customer care to get the refund for atleast the missing items in full if not the wrong one and have been told that they are just a food delivery platfrom and too bad too sad. So going ahead please shift to cod - check products and p"
"It is irresponsible service provders, because i have madeethe order and i got i call from swiggy deleviry boy, and they said that that one item is finished, kindly choose another item but i cancelled my order, they said i got my refund in 24 hours, but 8 days after i did not get any refund andwhen i called costmer care they dined me for refund, and they said i have not reacied my order than they made cancellation whole amount,  I am very disappointed with swiggy, i never ever make oder.Rubbish"
"We hv ordered vegetables in swiggy.thy hv mentioned rs.24/kg in display, but when you go for final payment it mentioned for half kg.it's totally confused.we may think about paying for 1kg vegetables for rs.24 but they hv calculated rs.48 for onion.in local shops selling same vegetables RS.24/kg. double the price and no proper response from customer service"
Very bad service unreliable  I ordered pizza 418 rupees per paid nobody call me I waited for one hour I checked they had cancelled my order and No refund  I talk to them they I didn’t respond their delivery boys call it is totally fraud nobody call me  From now onwards no swiggy I am publishing this To alert everyone don’t use this app  If you use swiggy you will definitely regret later  I am trying to take legal action
"Yesterday, i ordered something, the delivery boy did not even come to the door i was there and i did not get any call. They have canceled my oder and deducted my money around 300 inr and i was waiting desperately, because i was too hungry. Now they are blaming me that i did not pick their call."
Today me and my husband ordered for swiggy. When delivery executive came he did not wear mask and gloves. When we asked why dont you wear mask and gloves he replied that swiggy has not privided them. Now Covid 19 is spreading drastically and swiggy is assuring they are providing sufficient procurement for it. But all commitments are false.
"Guys, never accept the offer shared on call by the team on your order if things are not as you requested as they will make fool of you and if there is any item missing trust me you won't get your whole money including those extra charges that these guys charge you even when it's not your fault. The same thing happened to me. Disappointed and lost my hard earned money. Negative rating from my end."
I have my own review and frankly telling you friend don't install this app ever. I orderded food yesterday night from swiggy. One hour spent but didn't assigned any delivery excutive for my order. Finally they cancelled my order without asking me to cancel or not. I had a very bad experience with swiggy.
Pathetic service..  Wrong cancellation charges deducted  Big frauder.........bad executive they don't know how give good service
"Never there when needed for some enquires, Bad at refunding money. Lack of information. Do something about it"
"I have been a customer of swiggy for a long time now. Never has it ever happened that I have unable to receive my order. Tonight after I ordered, firstly the restaurant did not accept the order even after 10 minutes, secondly after when it was picked up, the delivery executive was being shown going in a different direction. I was on call with a family member. When I got information about the foods arrival, I went to get it. But soon after it was cancelled. I was charged more than half of the amount as cancellation charges. I don't think I should have been charged for a glitch on the app. But I guess it's tough times.. And people can be fooled easily."
"I had ordered a few groceries in swiggy by paying in advance and their delivery guy cancelled the order on his own and charged me approximately Rs 200 as cancellation charges( in spite of my not cancelling the order), when I didn't take his call, as I was in the washroom. Since then I ve mailed them repeatedly but no avail their delivery guy could've very easily dropped my order at my home , I think it's unethical as well as blatant cheating in this case. I would advice everyone to pay cash on delivery toavoid being cheated"
"With the widespread COVID-19 issue, Swiggy disabled their COD option. Which is a good step towards maintaining safety standards. However, I don't have any option for online payment because I neither have a debit/credit card and hence, nor any UPI/wallet. And now they're even closing the Swiggy Daily app, which used to accept COD for trials as well as subscriptions. I am a daily customer and order at least 2 meals on a daily basis, including weekends. But now, because of this COD issue, I am forced to quit using Swiggy as well as Swiggy Daily. But, in my opinion, concerned customers WILL and SHOULD make online payments and opt for the ""leave at gate/doorstep"" option, whether the COD option is available or not. And I'm facing trouble because of being hungry most of the days due to unavailability of any restaurant on the app(s) that accepts COD at the moment. Thank you Swiggy for the incomparable services. And good bye"
"Hello friends, so today I am talking about swiggy food delivery services. Most of the time I'm ordering the food outside thats why I have an experience of swiggy. Swiggy is most time taking food services. Firstly the restaurant take too much time to make the food and then the delivery boy also take time. Mence if you ordered at 12 AM then your order will reach at 1: 30 PM. And some times it will cancel your order for no reason. And if they want to cancel your order then they also not talking about that, when you call the restaurant and ask that person then they  told you. Im really not satisfied with their services.  Thank you."
The worst platform for food delivery. Neither delivery executives nor Swiggy takes ownership when items are not delivered. Today items worth 428 not delivered and Swiggy gives rs.100 coupon as consolation. Beware of the cheaters!!!
"Very bad service and food quality was bad. No proper response for delivery or anything, on chat gives irrelevant information. Will give restaurant number which is switched off. Then will say will reach the restaurant. Then to complain if we reach they will say will check and update, then will say we cant help you. Very bad. Big cheater and loots money from people. Greedy swiggy. Takes money of the people. Its a new trick they are following to get the money from people."
"I ordered my food, It came with a tampered package, curry was leaking and made the paper cover wet While the delivery @sshole took the cover from his scooty, it fell on down and everything spread on road. I called swiggy and they said cannot refund. Dont order in swiggy, such an @ssholess and cheaters mother fuckr$"
"I would like to inform you that I have already made a complain on swiggy chat but your executive tripti does not able to help me, then I told her to transfer it your senior, she rejected that, again I told her the same then she transferred to Aditya, but same problem, he also not able to help me, he keep on repeating same lines, which are copied and pasted. Now let me tell you my issue, I got my order delayed, my food was cold like ice then it was not handled properly by your delivery executive, not packed properly.  Also it is very sad that I have to write an email to you, if the conversation is going on swiggy chat so why I have to drop an email, I think this is not the right way to move forward. Also I don't have any photos related to my compalin, you should inform to your customers to take pictures of the mishandled food.  At last I want my hard earned money back. I will stop using Swiggy. I think you are not bothering to take care of your customers"
Not worth to order any thing from Swiggy as food they deliver is been never upto the mark and also they don't respond to our query as per customer satisfaction...
Swiggy has hire some unprofessional dilivery person. Very bad attitude of customer care executive. I am not recommended swiggy to anyone. Please stay away from Swiggy.
"I want my money back bhikari lok,  Don't fool customer's,  Go and beg on road."
"My experience on SWIGGY is very bad, this happened twice to me. paid money online, ordered food, SWIGGY boy picked up the food, on the way, 24 minutes to reach the delivery destination, looking at the mobile and waiting for the food, suddenly another message, your order cancelled by SWIGGY, reason - you are not available to receive the food, the delivery boy called you four times. No call came to my mobile, food didnot reach me. I called the SWIGGY boy to find out what happened, he told, the food is with him, he will bring the food, but didn't turn up. Called SWIGGY help line, customer care, bad response, 70% of my money deducted by SWIGGY. I paid money, waiting for the food, no call from SWIGGY boy, no food reach me and SWIGGY deducted 70% money from me.I found out waht happened, from another SWIGGY boy, what he told me, please read carefully.SWIGGY delivery boy, picked up the food, he didnpt go to the delivery destination, cancelled the order with some reason that the customer at fault, instead he took that food for himself or his friends, or sell that food to other people.When you will inform Customer care or help line, you will not get good response, as if they are also involved in this planned process.Sent mail to Customer care, alsoto the Founder of SWIGGY, no good response. This is SWIGGY, please be careful."
"Swiggy is the best Food delivery app ever I had seen . It Delivers Food Very Quickly & Fastly . The Delivery Partner of the Swiggy is very Friendly to us . If we need any help , Surely they will help . I had A Better Experience with Swiggy ."
As we all know the swiggy is the most valuable food delivery service but is it right? of-course not.  Past month I had an order from swiggy at 12 AM it showed to deliver by half an hour. So I was waiting for it and the time was 12:45 AM but it won't came yet and not showing the delivery boy number. I had no option instead of waiting. He was too late and reached at 1:10 Am.  Many times it shows us half an hour but takes too much time.  Many times it cancel orders with no reasons. You can't expect delivery on time. The service and support is not too good and responsive.  Sometimes delivered wrong product and arguing with the customer. This is one of worst and pathetic thing about it. Atleast it is better than other delivery services. This are some pros and cons
"Most of the time their service is good.  But I had a worst experience with them once. I have ordered meals when I wife is in hospital, they didnt deliver even after 1 hours. When I called them they told the restaurant is closed and they are unable to pickup.  At this moment we cant do anything except to cancel the order."
"I have placed an order with bill amount of 660 rupees, however as the expected time of arrival was too high, immediately I cancelled it. They charged 300 rupees as a cancellation fee. Unfotunately, as I already made a payment through online. I left with no option other than accepting it.it is really pain of gettingwhen they chatge 50% of cancellation on total bill amount.This is not at all acceptable.I contacted customer care, they were given irrelavent answers, ."
I hv ordered Mcdonalds. They are claiming that they called me for delivery. But i hvnt received any call from them and not delivered during the lockdown. I waited almost 1 hour after that they said you hv cancelled ua order. After so many argument they said you didnt pick up the call. Funny thinv i never had a call from them n mobile was with me. 50% cancellation charges deducted and looted the money from my account. Very bad experience..
I have ordered bakery items from swiggy. I didn’t receive any call and the order was cancelled. 50% was charged as cancellation fees. I reordered the same items. Still mu cancellation was not refunded. Due to covid19 orders are being cancelled by them to earn from cancellation fees. Good guys. On one hand u r trying to show that u r at service by delivering items. On d other hand u r earning in this way to fees your company. SHAME ON YOU
I am really satisfied with the management. They have intervained into my problem and solved this soon.
I had placed an order using Swiggy. They don’t have a proper services. High risk ordering in the night time. Never ever believe swiggy for that matter. They will make you wait for an hour and cancel the order later with no alternative options or still the order will be active until you approach them. They don’t care how hungry you are or what you do. Fake sorries and ₹100 coupon they offer to accept the apologies. Beggars are even better in the streets. If we accept that coupon. Third class service. For the rating or feedback. Hope there is a 0 to a rating. They don’t even deserve zero for their services
"I ordered food from this app but it was worst. The app says that it will deliver the fast but it never delivers on time . It is one of the worst app to deliver food on time. It delivers the food when it gets cold. When you will call the resturent it says that food is redy but delivery boy is not there and when delivery boy is there, it takes much time by the delivery boy to deliver the food.When you open the app and see the delivery time , it hardly says 40 but it takes more than 1 hours to deliver the food . Swiggy has the worst delevry boy collection with worst attitude , only they say you the reason behind their late delivry and say you to give them full star so that they could get good money .It is the worst app and I say you to order from other app like foodpanda, zomato and other."
I ordered a meal yesterday from swiggy but payment done by me was in advance via paytm.  I asked the delivery boy about the incompelete order and he told me that he cant help it and Then I contacted the customer care which wasnt a help.  This is an act of malpractices done by so called reliable companies
"Doing extortion duribg COVID19 circumstance as they charged twice for single request in one exchange, on the off chance that you paid direct through swiggy portal. If you don't mind check your record exchange in the wake of requesting with swiggy.  They convey just a large portion of the things that are requested and afterward they state sorry we can't redress. Ridiculous villains who requested that you redress? You have to convey for what clients pays or you should discount the sum. Most exceedingly awful client support organization ever I saw. Number one misrepresentation organization."
"It is 1:15 in the night in which I have ordered food from Swiggy.I do not put a review on such a night, do not put it at all. If it does not, I am very upset that time. Paneer two onions and 8 rotis I cannot cook at my house, so I have ordered online and in it Paneer Do Onions is smelled in poverty and cheese is also It has become very tight, it has remained tight, which  does not look good at all, now, where should I Complain in this time and from where to eat food during this time?  There are three boys in the room who eat one of the paneer, one of the paneer, two of the onions, in which I have also put a pick, look at that we have thrown the rest.We have to sleep a lot. We ask them for water, but it is happening to us that it does not look good at 1:30 in the night.  Now I'm afraid to order again Swiggy"
"Doing fraud duribg COVID19 situation as they charged twice for single order in one transaction, if you paid direct through swiggy gateway. Please check your account transaction after ordering with swiggy."
They deliver only half the items that are ordered and then they say sorry we cannot compensate. Bloody scoundrels who asked you to compensate?? You need to deliver for what customers pays or you should refund the amount. Worst customer service company ever I saw. Number one fraud company.
I ordered first time from swiggy and I am very with their delivey and taste of food was yummmmmmmm.  Now I ordered every time only from swiggy
As we ordered for food before 1 hour haven't delivered the food when I contact with restaurant food was ready but delivery boy was not available to pick the order very worst experienced I had with swiggy even so many people guys don order with swiggy  Zomato is far better then this
Many times I have faced worst service from swiggy . They are charging additional charges very high still they are not giving quality services. After they are talking money they will be telling ordered items not available.
Because to this corona why swiggy is not giving holiday to employee those who give delivery because they interact mostly with customers so plz accept my request
Order jain through the swiggy online ordering app. food delivered contained onions and was wrong. no replacement. images were compulsory as proof. first told would be replaced. then told no. totally rubbish ordering service. also took forever to arrive. not confident to return at all. TERRIBLE!  bogus ordering app and even worse service
Delivery person reached on some other address starting arguing related to delivery address  And swiggy has refund less amount instead of refunding the complete amount
Its absolutely a worthless fooding app. Never place an order here. I once ordered here at 10 o clock at night but it was 11: 15 pm still the order was not delivered. Later when I called the food valet he was not delivering the order as he was coming from somewhere else.Later when I called the swiggy customer care they said that the order shouldn't be delivered due to their own problems . We had nothing left to eat for that night.Absolutely worthless and
Get out of my country. I have never experienced such a pathetic service.  My order is yet to delivered. It’s been three days and no refund
"Swiggy are cheaters and liars.they stole my money and didn't deliver the item .I hate the new system of sending an email, when they just bullshit and apologize but don't attempt to counter the mistake they have done . I sent then the image of the bill and the items delivered still they didn't bother to refund the item I didn't get ..losers ....Pathetic experience . From as to worse support"
"Inspite of repeatedly asking Swiggy to ensure that there is an option to remove oneself from their subscription through email and mobile number, they do not have the facility. It is frustrating that they keep flooding ones mail with spam on offers that are not needed and the inability to stop sending text messages. New users who install Swiggy please be aware they spam you with unwanted mails and text messages on deals regular intervals during the day with no option to unsubscribe."
"I had ordered food recently from Swiggy.Before placing the order the website was showing that the coupon code SWIGGYIT had been applied, and that my order had saved rupees 80. The total order amount was rupees 213. But after I had placed my order(COD) , when I recieved order confirmation via SMS the amount was showed as rupees 299. I honestly hate such kind of fraudulence. When I tried to contact their customer care I realized I had to 'chat' with the employees and trust me such a system does not work out at all. I had even taken a screenshot of the order before placing and was asking for a refund as a compensation for such bad service. All that the employees told me were that they were very sorry for the inconvenience. Then someone said they would ask a higher executive to call me back but that never happened. They have no proper number to call them and contact them on and you need to sit and 'chat' with the goddamn customer care. Didnt get any response for a long time and finally when I did they addressed me by another name(they didnt even know who they were mailing to) and started blaming the restaurent about not applying the coupon code. I'm just done with this stupid site and its pathetic customer support. Please go order from zomat. Btw I had to give it a 1 star. It's just that mothshut didn't allow me to."
Tried complaining about cold food got shutdown saying contact customer support via email. This company is not going far with this kind of attitude and poor service. People will remember them.
Order was ruined for me n my night spoilt.  But swiggy did respond quickly to my mail and managed to turn things around. Appreciate it.  Though I hope it doesnt happen again.
I ordered a la pino'z pizza from swiggy. As you can see the pizza i got from swiggy. DISAPPOINTED. Dhnyewaad.
"Are there so much demand of such services in reality? I have ordered a bit from them and the person simply delivered it a bit late, but I do hope that nothing will happens after that anyway. These drivers really mad on car traffic."
"I have ordered my food from swiggy owned restaurant Homely and almost more than 30 mins, someone from swiggy called me, they are cancelling my order as restaurant dont have the item which I have ordered.  AFAIK I knew, the order is confirmed by restaurant and then executive allocated for the pickup. but strange how restaurant take the order if they dont have item.  backend team seems disable, dont act on time and asusual mentioned Sorry when I called. no one called from swiggy to me.  also a strange thing when I go to help option in Swigy app, still it mentioned new ETA for my food delivery. wow  really pathetic service pathetic back end team, I am uninstalling the app right away, as now a days there is lot of good options around.  I from Delhi/NCR."
I am really disappointed with the food ...i instructed them to not add coriander in food due to allergy..they never follow the instructions such bad restaurant and I also talked about this problem with swiggy costumer care about my problem they didn't respond me ...they only look for their money they don't satisfy their costumer seriously feed up ...such an fool app....and costumer service is also non satisfied....they only care about your payment they never care about service which has been given to you by them...they only apologize and step back...that's what they do
"Such a bitter experience with Swiggy . The money was deducted from my bank account but order was nvr placed . Tried many times to contact customer care executives , every time I had to explain the issue to each n every executive. But of no avail. They open a chat window and ask for the screen shot about the deducted amount but attachment option is given nowhere in the app. I lost my money . Zomato is far better and transparent in resolving the issue . Swiggy is not well equipped to handle the customers’ issues . Thumbs down ??"
"Hi,  Order No: #66990206725  Restaurant:Madras Cafeteria  Ordered at 1:50pm  Order should be delivered in 35mins from time of order.  Order Delivered at 2:58pm    Order was delivered very late from said order time as promised in the app.    when checked with your customer care over call said the delivery person is not responding. when asked for status this happened after said time of 35mins.    when you could not send order on time asked for refund the reply was you can cancel the order and you will get the full refund.    if I have to cancel the order and re order the food I dont think you customer care suggest me that. his reply was when ever you get you take or leave it.    if it is such a case that if we have to cancel the order for late delivery and reorder something and wait for another 40+ minutes. this way we have at breakfast time and we will get at lunch time.    for what purpose your are charging service charges+ delivery charges to us to give such support you wait till you get your order or cancel it.    this shows how arrogant the swiggy has gone with its customers.    After receiving the order food is cold and sambar with it was stale.    so to server cold and stale food you are charging these charges.    when took up this complaint to your chat team. they refunded me a 25rs coupon. I dont know for what they have given me such refund.    your chat is just a automated bot which can only response via copy paste of already existing replies present with him.    what ever issue you raise it will be kind of your chating with bot with such responses.    then he say he cannot do anything a write a email to you. that you will investigate the issue and resolve. I dont know how you going to investigate this I think you will take the help of CB CID.    such a disappointment I m uninstalling the app and swear that I will never use your stubborn-arrogant company."
Its online fraud service. They are grabing money from customers. I don't know how long they survive. With burning stomach I am writing this review. They will destroy soon. Im waiting for that day. How long they will eat food by this way. Better go for Zomato. Now im happy with zomato service. I uninstalled swiggy app from my mobile.
Worst service after 1 hour it say food cannot be delivered..Money can be refunded after 1 hr..  Its the procedure it seems
"Service is very bad , i have ordered food, by mistake address entered wrongly then I requested to change the address thy said it is too for from the hotel , so we are cancelling the order and they have charged 50% to cancel the food"
I do not like the service of swiggy because of the I'll service they provide. I ordered my food to d correct location and the delivery guy went to wrong location and he says he is not able to find the place. I asked him to send his location in whatsapp and he is 7.5 kms away from my location... I had updated my address as sathya layout and he has typed the address as sapthagiri layout n I sent him the screenshot of d location I typed in d app.... After 1.5hours of waiting I raised a concern at help desk and the person says as a cancellation restaurant has charged you n swiggy.. I don't understand when I hav not cancelled the order why am I charged? And it is delivery guys fault that he doesn't know to navigate properly.... I had to pay 300+ for his mistake... Worst experience... I texted my family and explainef them in d scenario and asked them yo stop using swiggy

"Swiggy is cheating its customers. We had ordered thru swiggy looking at the menu given in swiggy app. After half hour of placing order the restaurant wants us to cancel the order saying the item is not available.when item is not available why did restaurant accept order in first place. Secondly, during festival time if they have no time for online service. They should have mentioned no online service available.if they accept order means the must serve us all the mentioned items. Swiggy after being big on customers money, has started fooling its customers..it is not waste of time and energy fighting with Swiggy. We are filing complaint in consumer court."
I used to order on swiggy every time but after looking 3 to 4 time now I am writing a review and they are bringing the food from different restaurant when I complaint them at that time they are giving me Rs 200 voucher they are fraud and they are charging Rs 200- Rs 300 on each product and+ delivering .swiggy is cheating with us and I am really disappointed with they service  when that man brink the order there is no bill in the packet and on that packet there is no brand on that pack and usually Restaurant seal the pack and give to the person but here I cant see any brand on packet its plane packet . there are 100% chance they are doing some think wrong with the customer .
"Slow. Promised delivery in 40 min. Delivery came after 1 hour 40 minutes and the cunning little crooks kept on increasing the ""arriving in"" time counter 2 minutes at a time. No option to complain. If you cancel, you pay the full amount anyway.  So get your womenfolkto cook and save yourself some money. If that's not an option, save yourself the delay and frustration and get something from some nearby restaurant."
"I placed an order on Swifgy today. Within 40 mins I had a message that said order cancelled. After speaking to the customer service, I was given to understand that they called my number several time and we dint respond to the calls. However I tried convincing them that I never received any calls in my registered number.  pS the food was for some guests. Not only they put me in an embarrassing situation but are not also doing a full refund. They are trying to convince that it was me on fault for not receding any call. Why would I waste time and money if I am waiting for dinner for guests.  Also I ordered food from 2 places one from swift and the other from somewhere else, I did receive their call and order right on time. I am asking for a re delivery attempt as well, to which they are refusing.  Indirectly no refund and no re delivery. I don’t understand the fact that why shall I loose money when I am not at fault at all."
"Very bad experience with the customer support. Even after sending many reminders about the issue with the Order, they don't even bother to ask. Customer service would send only the scripted mails.. No resolution at all. Be away from SWIGGY."
I ordered on swiggy for red pattaya curry from seson 9 restaurant .restaurant fully help me but swiggy give me 30 rs coupan and don't give my money back because ordered missing main thing of dish main thing was missing and he give me apology against my valuable money ..very dissatisfied
Don’t buy anything from swiggy. It’s delivery agent literally threaten me while delivering order. Because he has to find little bit . How u Guyes hire ur delivery person. I am being threatened after paying money. Hell is a service.
I delivery was fast and quick. I was a great experience with the Swiggy. The food was also qualitable
"I have placed an order for huge amount and paid online.  Got a call from the delivery boy that he is not able to view my order, and asked me to call the customer care, as he was not able to talk to their executive.  Called, the customer care with a long waiting time, when I was speaking to customer care got a message, that my food was delivered, and they were not able to reach the delivery person.  Now Swiggy customer care was giving me two option -  1.) They will enable refund, which I will get it after 5 days.  (or)  2.) They will place another order, but the item what I ask was not available.  This gives a great lesson, NOT to pay the money online, to Swiggy where they service system is not having any process/reliability.  Best is avoid swiggy."
Ordered my food today  It's been 40 min now..  I didn't received yet  Paradise restaurant is just a half mile away..  No customer care support  No response..
Order I received fully spilled and nothing was their to eat when I ask for replacement of food they denied and refund also made 50% only. They are fraud people eating the money like this only when resturant mistake why customer should be penalised hopeless service swiggy is doing... useless service previously also I received spoiled food but no response from the swiggy.. useless worthless and fraud services swiggy is running...
"Have experienced at 2 times that Swiggy failed to deliver food. Recently happened when I ordered food with guests at home. After 45 mins wait, Swiggy told me the delivery guy damaged the food when he was 1 mins away from my home and it will be another 45 mins to 1 hour. Frustrated I decided to cancel the order than wait and it showed up as if I have cancelled the order in the history. I had rush out of home to make alternate arrangements for guests. All Swiggy customer rep could offer was apology and no talk about any coupons, discount for future. So I have been a regular Swiggy customer and this is how they treat their loyal customer. Have installed other competitors app now and very happy with them."
"Service and support : - The service they provide is basically of delivering food from restaurant to you and it is delivered through their delivery mans all around the India , so basically I ordered food from swiggy on 5th march 5: 00 pm the order I received was at 7: 10 pm this is such late delivery I wanted that food on 5 but at 7 it has no use also the food was not hot , delivery person said that his vehicle got panctured in between  Information depth : - thier app is not very much informative and the ui is also not good , I felt like the restaurant has good rating but the food I received from them was not that tasty  Conten : - content is average  User friendly : - their delivery person some are good but some are very rude in nature one didn't even gave me some small change also  Time : - the amount of time they tell you on the screen ( of your phone) is exactly different from that of the actual time in which we got our parcel delivered"
Biggest scam business in market. SWIGGY scam thier customer and not giving any refund. had this experienced more 5 time they never give any refund. I totally recomend you to be safe.
Very bad service as irems were missing from order and customer support does not provide any solution ... And no refund was provided
"I did not get my money refund back, as they mention in there policy they will return money within 5-7 days"
Did not satisfy order after taking it. Forced to change order after accepting payment with food options that were tasteless. Disappointed.
"We poor experience, if delivery boy gets delayed and you try to contact customer care for tracking. They starightaway have only one solution that is cancelling the order. They just don't care if anybody is hungry."
"I have placed order on swiggy after 2hours swiggy persons call that we can't send parcel due to more distance, so we are going to cancel order, after cancellation we will refund ur money after deduction of cancellation charge 50%, with in 4-7days,"
I order at night and waited for 3 hours to get my order their employee switch off the mobile and i was irritated then i cancel the order even today i did not receive my money around 1500 rs worst services ever seen
"The chat guys look like auto chatbots, incapable of resolving any issue. I simply wanted refund for my money for the unhygienic, polythene panni packed chutney with no disposable spoon for sambar, and that much cold dosa looked as if refrigerated for days."
I have ordered a pizza on 8:37pm and delivery time was mentioned 27 minutes and after that I got call thay they are assigned another delivery note so it will be some delay in the order..drama starts here I got call twice for the same excuse and 3 time delivery boy has been changed and after 2 hours:20 minutes of this drama my order got cancelled .this is happening from last two orders
"Worst service given by swiggy and it’s customer executive has also not helped me, they have cancelled the order and charged cancellation fee, very disappointed from their service, now I will not buy a single food item from Swiggy, I will take it from Zomato"
"Worst service given by swiggy and it's customer executive has also not helped me, they have cancelled the order and charged cancellation fee, very disappointed from their service, now I will not buy a single food item from Swiggy, I will take it from Zomato"
Today Swiggy scammed RS. 170/- out of me. What happened was that they put the location wrong. Yes THEY put the location wrong. How is it possible that my mobile is with me in Green Hills Colony but they say that it is showing 4kms way and that too in a place where I have never been before and never heard too. And since the delivery boy didn't know where Green hills Colony was I would have to cancel my order and Rs. 170/ would be deducted (that amount was more than half of my bill so you can guess that the cancellation charge is more than 50%). Pure daylight Scamming. Just how stupid do they think we customers are. People please check after ordering whether the location is right or not lest they scam money out of you like me. For me I m installing Swiggy(been using it for more than 1 year) and going for Zomato.
Swiggy is fraud!!!! Never make a pre paid order with them they will never deliver it. All they care is about drain money from your pocket .their delivery boys will not pik up ur call they dont care about your money and your time all they care is how to make money by cheating people . These people are FRAUDSTERS they should be closed .people should delete their app from the phones they are not reliable and trustworthy . I will never order again from swiggy in my whole life .
"Please read this review carefully.  I am 30 years old and by far this was the worst meal of my life. I am not exaggerating this as well. So hear me out. They charged me around 400 and they gave me coloured water literally instead of iced tea. The burgers had extremely hot red chilli paste which made it impossible for us to take second bite. The fries were not sprinkled with salt I think salt was sprinkled by fries. It was so salty that we had to throw the entire package as it is. Now, I am ready to prove my point. So I am ready to invest more 200 and order the same thing again if any genuine human being from swiggy has guts to eat it and say whether I am lying or not. I am so much disappointed with the food and service provided by swiggy that I am actively looking for legal help in this regards and also trying my best to let other people know in social media how they are being cheated by this companies. The iced tea(omg) or coloured water was thrown in basin as it is. I would have been happy if normal plain water would have been served instead of that. Please take me seriously. This was not a meal but a torture and I am not at all exaggerating. This was the worst experience of my life with any of the companies ever in my life. I mean I feel like if someone would have taken my money by force I would not have been this mad. But the food that I got today should not even be categorised as food. I respect food and I m a person who hates wasting food and I had to throw things away means there is something seriously wrong with the restaurant. If the restaurant owner / manager is reading this, boss please re think your strategy. You can't mess with food this bad and hope to stay in business for more than a week. If this is what you have been serving to customers you might have to close down soon. Train the chef or change the chef. But do something soon. Worst food of my life by far. We trust swiggy and order from the restaurants based on reviews now I think they are all fake. They offered me 100 rs. Coupon why should I take 100 rs coupon I wasted 400 rs. And you get out free. No that's not possible. Worst service ever"
"I order some food in November 2019 from this companies mobile app fullstop I order one plate fried rice and one plate chilli chicken with salad from this company's app. The delivery time of my address in this companies app was 29 minutes, the mail was delivered to me within 25 minutes. Then I I deliver the food out of the packet after delivery. Then I noticed that the fried rice quality was just as bad, the food was shot in a semi boiled state, and there was a bad smell coming out the fried rice. and I didn't get any salad with this mail, and chilli chicken's condition was similar. It was absolutely nasty to eat chilli chicken full stop then I call these companies customer care, and talk about our bad food. And from customer care I was informed that, we will take action on this matter and give you a refund of the money we paid. but then no phone calls or SMS from this company. And the company didn't give me any refund."
I got wrong order i take swiggy customer help but they can't help me i want my money back but they refuse me worst experience i don't like swiggy
"I have ordered a cake via swiggy, , there was miscommunication of location, , i had talked wid the delivery boy, , he said will delivery the cake at right location which was just 1 km far away . I told him i will give him extraa charges..as its was a anniversary cake. Thn customer care call me that Don't pay extraaa charges..we will pay ...later on again after 1hour another girl form swiggy called me nd said as its wrong location we can't delivery , , , so we r cancelling the order nd cancellation charges 182/-..they chanceles the order with charges...if i can afford cancellation charges 182/- , , can't i afford 20rs to the delivery boy.. worst service i have experienced.. they just ruin my day"
"Hi,  Placed an order for cake and added correct addres but selected wrong location since Im new to place, then they charged 50% of total amount without delivering me any product.  worst service"
Need more clarity in assistance and the app could be even more user friendly. Executives should know the procedures of the company and should be able to guide customers. The customer service executives should take customer queries into concern as well and reply with just. They can work for their company and should also be able to answer the queries and mistakes that happens from company side as well.
"I had placed an order on 25th Feb which was and within 2 mins I have requested to cancel it(because from the restaurant I have ordered the food is very far from my place) but the customer executive said(Cancellation Fee is charged to compensate the restaurant). I don't understand which hotel in this world prepare foods within 2 mins.  Than I said OK if the order is confirm then please deliver to me on time but noooo as usual they did not delivered it on time, they delivered the order exactly after 1 hour 3 Mins they have very very bad customer support  this 2 star I giving only for that delivery person as he is very polite and soft spoken"
"As we are waiting for the best food with great deals and at the end of process , it shows dispatching rates , which seems like quite high & hesitating"
"They have no way to change addresses good or bad. Oh and if your do not pick the delivery boy phone( LORDS are called Delivery partners) they may go to wherever they feel the address shows.  Then you may get a cancellation and a hindi speaking dude will call you "" sun rahaa hai"" etc and say you are hereby issued cancellation penalty"
"This incident happened to me on 7th Feb 2020. Food was ordered by someone in the apartment with Order No: #64164503127.  Delivery executive Shahid Khan with mobile number 9741010269 came for delivery. After delivery he has stolen my helmet which was kept on my Activa. We have CCTV evidence for the same. When we spoke to this guy, he switched off his phone after we told him about this.  Its been 2 weeks that we reported this to Swiggy but they have not taken any action against the delivery boy and also I have not received my helmet yet.  PATHETIC Customer service by Swiggy. PLEASE beware of delivery executives from swiggy because if then can steal helmet, they can as well rob our houses!"
"They are now setting up kitchens to produce food in commercial office complexes . polluting the atmosphere, causing damage to building and exhausting fumes, choking up drain lines in premises that are not designed for massive industrial kitchen flouting fire safety norms .  deivery boys running up and down the elevators with thalees nd food plates . complete lack of ethics, hygiene and safety .  with all the massive funding from US they have the money to grease palms and get licenses and NOC from various institutions ."
"We had a horrible experience today when my daughter ordered pizza and cheese garlic bread from pizza Hut via swiggy... The bill amount was ₹649 .... The food arrived completely cold and stale on writing a feed back on app the had a recorded msg on repeat saying a food coupon odd ₹125 been initiated... How can they even compensate without knowing the matter properly.  Worst service ever from swiggy, one food that you can't even heat was deivered cold and stale as if it was made ages ago."
"The worst app and with the worst Customer support team, I faced an issue for the refund of my wrong delivery wherein they asked me to write an email to initiate a refund. Why the hell would I write an email to get a refund of the wrong item delivered to me?.  Zomato is way better than swiggy . I have faced a series of refund related issues"
"I have ordered from Swiggy a couple of times. On November 3rd, I had to cancel my order because the delivery guy did not pick my order from the restaurant and when I reported the same to the call centre executive he said he was unable to assign another delivery boy to collect my order. I was told to cancel but I would have to bear some cancellation charges.but for what? it was not my fault. after a long conversation, the executive agreed to refund the amount in full and it was refunded.  the next incident- it so happened that my food was collected by that nasty executive(ba#^@r#d) and he did not deliver it. I am yet to receive my refund.(9945871487 is that as$#0!e's number)  worst service ever. deleted the app."
These guys dont take immediate actions on missing orders even after showing the delivery guy. The swiggy owner must be one shameless mother fuckker
"First the delivery guy calls and says that he is at a different location from my home and I should send him a Google link. So I did. But he says that he is seeing a different location from what I am seeing (from the link that I sent him on his phone). So he says that I will get a call from customer service to resolve the issue. So, while I am chatting with customer service, my order gets cancelled because ""I was unreachable"". Plus I got charged for failed delivery on my next order. #SCAMMERS"
"Bad service from Swiggy Delivery boy Ramdas Mhask -Please beware from him .He behaved very rude, Intimidating with me female and my mom.  Please beware this man mobile nos is 9594301204"
"I had ordered on Swiggy ap food shows it will be delivered within 35 min and I placed and order after 20 min the tine changes then after 45 min Swiggy guy calls and says he has dropped the ordered and he will re order and get it in 15 to 20 min I said ok but within 5 min my order was showing as delivered and I raised a complaint but there was no topic on replacing they just said we are refunding the amount back and imagine I was like already hungry , all said and done they are not reliable and bothered be careful everyone"

The 3rd class app and 3rd class manager at CONTACT CENTER OF SWIGGY who don't have manners to speak with the CM.  I had ordered the food and they had charged me Rs. 91 after applying offer but buy mistakenly I had ordered on wrong address imidatly I canceled the order and they had charged me Rs.31 for cancelation charges. Only refund initiated of Rs. 60. Restorent Mai bhi khana deneko 25 min Tak lag jate h Inka order 2 minmai prepare ho gaya n jab refund ke leye bola to direct Mana kar deya. Baki ki koi bhi other app cancelation charges nai lagati. Sabji bhi 3 min Mai nai katti bewakuf kisi or ko banao Rs.5 kaat the to kuch ne direct 31 kaat ke bolte h ki nai de sakte bewakuf banake dhande h ab to kabhi na karu order is wearst app se na mere yaha kisi ko karne duing idiot log.
"Ordered vegetarian food from Swiggy and they delivered Non-veg food. When raised a complaint immediately with customer care via app they did not even care about resolving the issue and just insisted to send an email to support team.  Support team responded in two days and just mentioned sorry, this is the worst app, they don't care sentiments and emotions of the people."
Swiggy service is not good  2 time deducted money but order not placed  I want refund  Don't trust swiggy
"Hello, today I had the first worst experience with swiggy. The milkshake that I ordered was half drank and didn't have the swiggy seal when I ordered it today, exactly the same one I ordered yesterday from Shaken N Stirred, mall de goa, Porvorim, goa. The bottle was full with ice cream before. When asked, the customer care said they can only do a refund of half price, no replacement of the order. So we are stuck with a half missing tampered milkshake. Review:: don't do this to your customer swiggy, if you can't then don't provide the service. Attaching the half drank shake exactly the way we got it from the package. Very disappointed with Swiggy."
Disgusting app never  Delay your time more than an hour and no one will take responsibility and waste your time and money  My advice never use this app  And go for another apps they are much better than this
"I ordered a dish from Anjappar through swiggy today at bangalore.  The item was found unpacked and in place of Biriyani ordered some Kichdi was there.  On complainting to customer care, no proper response was there.  I paid Rs.376 for which I received a street dog lunch pack from swiggy.  Neither they replaced the supply nor did they refunded the amount.  So, kindly understand that this is an ill managed setup without any care for the customers.  You are not going to eat anything.  Swiggy is only eating your money."
"I had made an order from French loaf. The delivery partner called me saying that the items ordered are not available, so I decided to cancel my order. But then I received an update that the order has delivered on time in 18 mins. I immediately called Swiggy customer support, within 15 minutes my issue was sorted and got my refund.  I thank Swiggy customer support for the quick and immediate response."
There was a swiggy rider that came down the rizvi college area and knocked a bike off.. Y...?.... Coz the swiggy rider came down a one way and was in riding the vehicle in speed.. They just don't see and ride I guess
Ordered pure vegetarian food and delivered non vegetarian food and when I called them they kept me on call for half an hour and then asked me to sent them the picture of the food.. I sent the same but even after doing all the things which swiggy told they did not even bother to come back and solve the issue.  Worst service I have ever get.. Not going to order anything from Swiggy anymore now.. Ask my friends and family too not to order anything from Swiggy...  Worst ever...
Very bad services form swiggy. if Mobile Network not Reachable then swiggy order cancelled. No Matter Given Address is current. Mobile Number is important for customer delivery care. But Not Provide any customer care Number and Phone Number not provide any massage own my Phone . I lost 205 Rupees. Not refunded me full amount. I am trying to order form swiggy in future.
"Dear All,  I had booked two orders in Swiggy but one item was not delivered I had took the parcel nd went to my flat nd checked one item was not delivered I had called back to delivery boy he told he don't know nd he suggested me to call customer care customer care person told to write a email so I had wrote an email and got reply so surprisingly that sorry for the missed item next time we will make sure not to happen nd missed item money can't be returned back itseems.  So I felt very bad no food nd lost money too.  So frds plz make a note not to be book on Swiggy which is giving worst customer support.  I don't like anyone to loss like me  Thanking you,  Trinadh"
Cakes will not reach as cake.  It will definitely spoil the celebration mood.  It is the same case post escalated on complimentary replacement order too.
"I ordered food from Bhiwandi darbar and Swiggy dilivered the food and the food was not at all of level to eat. The food was oily, maximum colour that was applied, spicy and burnt.  When called Swiggy and they are least bothered and just refunding 350 against 1800 which is not acceptable.  I request people to pls go and eat instead of ordering from Swiggy as if food is not good, you will not get good service."
Swiggy app is number on e fraud today we have order a food in this app the person called only once we could not receive the call as I was in meeting later when I check the app they have cancelled my order and they have charged extra 579 for next delivery hari when we did not cancelled the order why the hell should we pay worst swiggy app
Some of the major fraud that Swiggy does is that on the app they will show discounted price just to fool the customers. Today i ordered milk from swiggy store which was showing on discounted price ( Full cream milk of Amul at Rs. 58) so i went ahead and ordered 14 cartons as it was on discounted price and i paid Rs. 779 online. When the delivery guy came he gave me a bill of Rs.894 and asked me to pay an additional of Rs. 140 on asking the reason the guy said that the milk was sold for original price.  My point is when you are selling things on MRP then why do you fool customers by showing that you are giving discounts or you show them at low price.  Swiggy has always done the same thing on restaurants and on swiggy store..they are best in fooling customers so that they make a purchase. THEY ARE A BIG TIME FRAUD and you can clearly see that everytime you make a purchase they show that they are giving an offer but in actual you are paying the full price.  I am also attaching the bills: Rs. 779 that i paid online for the purchase  And the bill that the delivery guy gave me of Rs. 894 ( the actual price that i had to pay)  Boycott swiggy..use ZOMATO they are much better and they are honest with the discounts unlike swiggy that kind of manipulates customer in looting the money.
Worst ever seen says first order use welcome50 coupon code while payment it ignores and debited full amount  Then raised a ticket they response after ordering they cannot help  Please I request the others user be far away from this kind of services they provide  Worst customer care team
I just dont understand when i already pay they cancel the order later on stating restruant is not accepting which has already been accepeted in app. AND if I do COD they will deliver at 2 am in morning as well. You people are not reliablebetter close your app. Bloody bullshit. This happened with me so many times. And what we will do with your apologies that will not full my tummy.
App sucks. Never captures the right address.  And they simply blame it on the customers.  I should have given a cash on delivery.  You pay online before food being delivered will be a huge mistake. They will charge 50per cent cancellation fee.
"I ordered from swiggy in Mussorie where it was showing available items n I paid 752 rupees for it. In 5-10 mins I recieved a computer generated call from swiggy saying items you ordered are not available please go to help section to choose alternate items. I called on swiggie's number n agent told me that I need to cancel this order.. The moment I cancel it, they charged me 227 for cancelation. I thought what the f is this. Then he replied that your order was for 550 some rupees and rest is cancelation for previous order.. Same thing happened where agent was unable to deliver my order n I have to rebook it from my wives phone. I do not understand how someone can charge for their own mistakes!! I do not recommend swiggy to anyone. Restuarants are fedup of them due to price cut n consumers too... They give advantage to us but at the same time this type of issues are also there."
They cancel order at the last moment. Happened with me for the second time. Waited for more than an hour for food and then they cancelled it.
I m very much disappointed with the Swiggy service. I am pure veg and today on 9th Feb ordered veg paneer Biriyani but they delivered me chicken Biriyani.i called to customer service for replacement but they told me not possible right now for replacement we can provide you cupon. As their responsibility is replace the food bcoz this lunch time. Anothe thing bill is only Rs 118 but the delivery boy took Rs 160 . What a service guys. Keep it up.
"Swiggy really never fails to disappoint me ! Half eaten food , cold food , packaging issues. I’m really done with this app . Would recommend zomato"
I have ordered two chocolava cake and one apple pie dat was complementary but didn't receive pie bought two chocolava cake of 380rps????after complaining got a coupon of 50rps pie was of 90bucks it is not about money it is about trust feeling cheated...
"Very very pathetic and low grounded services by Swiggy Zomato services are far better. I waited 2 hours for my delivery, but Swiggy didn't bothered a penny to revert me and say we are sorry that order is Delayed instead I called these idiots to inquire and what I get in return is we are sorry as their was no delivery boy we are late and in 20 minutes you'll receive your order. I waited for next 25 mins and nothing strange to hear back that we can't deliver your order and we cancelling it. Your refund will be initiated and will be credited in 5 working days. I was striving out of hunger but these maniacs didn't bothered at all. So no solution nothing. They are having Monopoly now as no one can do much. Creepy services of Swiggy."
"I ordered chicken fried rice, but another particles in thies dish and no taste food, sezwan souce very less,"
"Never order anything from Swiggy, the only thing they tell you when your order is delayed, ""Sorry"", ""Can We Cancel the order""; ""delivery partner is not able to find the address""; ""We can refund the amount""; ""We can add INR 75 to your account for your nest order""; they dont even understand people order food when they are hungry not because they want to cancel it or they want INR 75 as benefit. But when the food is not delivered, its really pathetic. Even the swiggy service/order management is confused what to tell the customer when the order is not delivered. #ConfusedSwiggy."
Swiggy is a big cheat one item from my order worth $80/- was missing and they are initiating coupons worth 25/- or 50/- as if we are beggars
Ordered food from dastarkhwan Mira road.  Difference in price on swiggy app and restaurant is more than 50%  Swiggy quotes 762/- for same order which is delivered by restaurant directly at 536/-  Even manufacturer doesn't earn this much in current scenario  Kya baat hai
I have ordered from this app not many times but when ever I did it was satisfying. The only complain I have is it does not deliver food on time and it is also very expensive. This app is worth the use only for people who order main courses of food or food in more amounts. But for the people who order food in small quantities have to spend more money for little quantity of food that is not even hot anymore  I have also read many reviews from different people who have been using this app to order food but are left unsatisfied. Yet I am not unsatisfied with this app  You can go for this app if you want to order food online.  Thankyou
Order #63477381139 was not refunded and now they are asking for 8 days for just 260 Rs  Shame on swiggy
I ordered pizza from swiggy and by mistake put wrong address. I immediately asked them to change the adress or cancel the order so that i can put new order. But they didnt change the address and charges almost half price of the order as cancellation charges. Its really bad. It is very disappointing for a customer as there should be provision for immediate cancellation
"I complained in swiggy for the same and no chat person tired solving the issue instead they said that I will have to mail,"
"I placed an order with swiggy which was not honored and was told it was my banks fault, however, it was actually swiggys fault where their list had a restaurant which closed by 12 but was visible till 2:45 am. Money deducted from my account but the ordet not honored by swiggy. When I contacted their customer service got the worst explanation and not being serviced at all. Even the supervisor zabir had the audacity to just closed the chat without any resolution. Very sad, will discontinue my 6 years loyalty with swiggy. Very unhappy and very bad swiggy."
"Always wrong orders are delivered. No replacement also, kindly solve this n I hope for good services further."
"As I have ordered some thing for which restaurant diid not follwed my instruction for which I have complained and also done mail for this but still I have not got any proper revert, it has been more than 18 days they are very careless for there premium customers"
"Order was cancelled not being able to locate my address and was told that I was called 7 times when I received the call only once. Faulty system logging of calls if I have to believe them and if not, an unprofessional and a lousy approach to solving customer complaints. Something not acceptable from a delivery partner!"
"I order food but not received, my messages will see Delivery the food but am not receiving. swiggy customer will told with in 3days refund with ur a/c"
My order is delivered to someone else.. Worst experience ever.. Now initiating my refund is not the permanent solution
"I ordered thai green curry veg which they have sent without rice and on reporting they are asking to write email we will get back in 5 to 6 hours how can anybody eat curry without rice, very pathetic response given by their supervisors they clearly have very bad services wont recommend any one to use swiggy ever again."
"Not good experience with customer care, going to uninstall. Not such customer support thing it's just filler"
"They play with consumers money and never pay back not deliver the food properly. My order was never delivered nor refunded, they are telling it cannot be done now as it had happened on 05.01.2020. Every forth day I am following it up but nothing is done. PEOPLE BE AWARE OF SUCH TYPE OF FROUD, CHEATING PEOPLE.  This order was assigned to 6 person and none had delivered the order. I had to visit personally after two hrs and bring on my own by paying again. I lost my face value in front of my relatives and also had to travel all the way for buying at that time. My payment receipt is also attached. order done at swiggy never completes this is happening for the second time."
I have ordered food and delivery guy is so rude and he refused to come to second floor.  He started shouting from downstairs. I complained same to swiggy team they said we look in to it and started shouting on me stating you have to go down and take the order. How come this kind of service is welcomed in my city. If there is below one star then I would be giving that
"I had a very bad experience with Swiggy while I placed my first order. They cancelled the order without notifying and charged cancellation fee. Neither I received the food nor was a gesture shown from their end, rather I had to bear a loss for cancellation. The customer service is pathetic. The do not know how to value their clients. I made an attempt to call the restaurant I ordered from but they happened to switch off the phone after my first call. Not at all recommended. Please forbid using Swiggy and save your money from getting wasted."
They never reply to emails..  Charges me for no reason  Worse service  Donot recommend  Charged for cancellation charges without informing
Swiggy App showed delivery will happen in 30 mins. Delivery guy came after 1 hour. Without swiggy bag or T-shirt. The parcel was in pathetic state. All torn and mud in it. When asked to the delivery guy he said it got spilled in the bag when asked what about the mud said their was methi sabji in his bag which had mud on it
"Arrogant Delivery Boy, Packaging issue, spillage, when I was not ready to take delivery, call centre executive insisted to take it and assured me coupn of 50% discount, which has not been provided to me call me on 9922416516, if this commitment was just to buy time and ensure opayment and delivery going forward I will not order from swiggy"
"ORDER ID 95962  MISSING ITEM not 1 but 2. On calling, the customer executives say to send email and they will revert by 6 hours.  Really! To get our own order back we have to wait 6 hours and if they do not call then it is a loss for us.  Even if they call, then they will say that it has crossed more than a hour so we cannot proceed for refunding or reordering the missing items  SWIGGY - If you guys need money, then SIT ON THE ROADS AND START BEGGING RATHER THAN THIS KIND OF UN PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR  I SAY NO TO SWIGGY"
Best service among all. I will always use this app . delivery always on timeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
"I am a regular customer with Swiggy and have been a super swiggy also but last few days the service of Swiggy is very pathetic. If we get wrong order if any items are missed in the food, they are asking us to send mail and wait for 4-6 days and after that they are asking for sorry so it means we have to loose our money . Recently I ordered from Wangs a spicy box which says it included 2 momos but I did not get it and when I chatted with the CS they are asking to send mail . Now what if the delivery person has eaten it. I lost my money and paid for the Swiggy delivery person food"
"Awesome service, delivery boy also nice behave.swiggy is very good for order food online from nearby restaurants and get food deliver in few minutes. . Swiggy app provide restaurants menu list items with image and review so its easy to place order food items. Swiggy food delivery service is very good and fas"
Dosent even deserve one star. Too pathetic service. Shut down your service if you are not customer friendly .
I have ordered chicken momos but I have received paneer momos. When I complaint about that then demands for pic. When I have send pics then demand for email. What is this?  If I have time then what need swiggy?
"The packing received for the items is just a plastic box and a transparent 1"" tape which can be got from any local store. Restaurants charge almost 8 to 10 times the cost of packing and more over not even one identification mark either of the restaurant or swiggy will be there on the items received. Swiggy only advertises very nicely but service wise worst experience."
"Swiggy cheats customers frequently. Swiggy customer care representatives will never refund back the money even if its thee mistake. They will suggest you to write to support@swiggy. Response from support will be "" Sorry this, this will never happen again. We are assuring to take strict action against the restaurant so that u don't face it again"".  Order the same item from the same restaurant, it will happen again.  Summary: Swiggy is doing an organized cheating business. Price differences are also very high compared to the original restaurant price."
I have order food (prepaid)on 1 jan from my mobile app through swiggy.it was showing 52 min to delivered.when I checked my phone after 40 min it was showing delivered. I immediately called swiggy nobody answered my call. Next day I tried to contact swiggy through chat. They told me they will get back since it was showing them delivered so they need to check and investigate.2 days later I contacted again rep advised me to send email to support desk. Since then I have been following every time I have to explain whole story they tell me they are investigating but nobody returns back with the resolution. This is so pathetic and annoying that you have to go through so much pain just to get your money back that too for the services which you have not been delivered.it is worst customer service
Very pathetic. My food was not delivered. And 50 percentage money deducted. Customer service is very pathetic.
"Ordered a cake, pineapple cake...got a butterscotch or something different...that too damaged one.  Raised the complaint with support team and they I have raised with wrong department.  Attached is screenshot..need refund..the idiot support guy venkatesh shares default templates only...with statement that I shall drop an email only...then why you have chat team..."
See how they give you discounts in the images below. They increase the price and then give you discount. Don't trust them ever.
"Swiggy is supporting the restaurants to sale their stale food. At midnight me & my friends ordered a meal which consist butter naan, daal makhani and shahi paneer. All these 3 foods was stale, smelling and tasting was very bad. I submitted my this concern to swiggy team but they just ready to give 85 Rs. I paid 225 and they were just giving 85 and even not taking complaints against that restaurant. After few days when no solution was there I asked them to return 85Rs but then they refused to refund me that amount also. Worst service and will not order any food from swiggy."
For 125 rupees order cancellation they have taken 65 rupees cancellation charge .its very poor and unfair .i will never try nor encourage my friends to order here. very bad experience .
I had ordered from Kesar around 6500 Rs work sweet and snacks.  The order was delivered with missing items and wrong items.  Hurray Now I am following up with them for invoice( I need one for office as it was office party) they still can not give one.  Really are they good at end to end process? Every one needs to think before you order
Please please download swiggy... 100% food delivery is fraud...and packing is also not good... Un install now...
This is the worst experience that I had with a food ordering app. I tried ordering from swiggy and I did the payment through Google pay and even after the money got debited my order was not placed. This was done on Jan 3rd and still I haven't recieved the refund amount. I message them daily and ask for the refund and its of no use. First they told the refund will done with in 2-4 business days and guess what happened it's been 2 weeks and still they are not willing pay back. Do not ever get trapped in their offers. This app is just for looting people.
So i've ordered for food    Kerala style chicken curry    Kerala parrota      And a free Chicken soup  Waited for 40 min approx  Paid the bill but when i opened the packet i got shocked with what i received non- edible chicken curry tastes rotten  And instead of kerala parotta they sent me A naan they charged me bloody 120/- for a mere 15 rupee naan and if you see chicken soup they sent you die laughing i didn't taste it because i got skeptical  Worst part is swiggy guys i would love to share recordings and screen shots of chat i had with them instead of resolving the issue they are asking to write a mail which made me wonder then why you guys even have chat process there !!? Second what i understood over the conversation with Mr.Jack (Swiggy CRE) there's no manager available with them and my bad review online doesn't matter to them so we should not be opting for swiggy  Anymore as they cannot resolve the issue on time neither their services are good
After paying for my food and waiting for one hour..  Swiggys calls me n says they have goofed up with the order and will have to cancel.  After working long day and wanting to have a decent meal..  This is wat swiggy did to me..  Pathetic..
Swiggy delivery partner umair ahmed delayed my order after that they charged me cancellation fee aswell for no reason i want my food and reverse the cancellation fee aswell
This is so disgusting swiggy is giving non sense service as it is delay and product price and quantity is different what it is mentioned
"The Good Bowl Mahim, Mumbai Restaurant and Swiggy together makes a Deadly Disastrous Combination to Spoil your Apetite!  How to spoil an afternoon amd how to fall flat on face in front of your subordinates, the above combination of The Good Bowl Restaurant and Swiggy Does it Brilliantly.  If you order food for Friends or Family, Dare to wait Helplessly, Minimum for 3 hours 43 minutes to keep your Guests Starving for Food!  The Assault of the Sorry Excuse of the Customer Care Representatives and Senior Officials will Add Insult to Injury is a Regular Phenomenon.  People, BEWARE of This Pathetic Service Provider & Avoid Dealing with Them!"
"I have ordered food from a known food outlet, where we usually dine there. We know the food quality and quantity for the price charged. When ever we order through Swiggy, the quantity we get is just the half we usually get directly from the restaurant. The customers who never visited this food outlet, will never come to know about it.  Swiggy is totally misleading customers in name of discounts. The escalation team is horrible to interact with. They say we can't call you, what ever you have issue please write in chat window of the swiggy app. I have received ordered food @ 9.11 pm and then after seeing the quantity, I requested the delivery boy to return the order. I contacted the swiggy help desk and mentioned my entire problem, the help desk transferred the issue to escalation team of Swiggy. By that time its already 10.00PM. The escalation team told that they cant call me and told to write the entire issue again in chat window, all discussions went to night 11.00pm. They harash people in night orders. Just be aware. I asked them to pay me compensation amount for the late night order which is caused by their negligence. I am also the 3 month preferred customer by paying swiggy charges. I shouldn't have done this. Swiggy service is pathetic."
Hi Guys I have been following up with an issue with swiggy for a month now and I dont see a Damn manager bothered aboubt my issue im surprised that this is the level of service provided by SWIGGY.
Cheating and they cheat by increasing the price of food items from the menu of the restaurant. earning good money .
"I order from Karachi bakery, but I got order with missing items, and I have mailed same thing @ support@swiggy.in but, that pathetic customer care guys repeating same matter( ""From siggy CC: I have checked your account, I am sorry to inform you that we cannot process the refund for this order. However, we value your relationship with us and take the feedback as provided.  While we regret that this has happened, we assure you that going forward such instances will be avoided as we are working towards that."") saying we can't refund instead of taking any action( either refund or items delivery). I have mailed them multiple times but same reply from them.  Seems big fraud they are doing by doing these kinda things. I have all the proofs. mine was around 200 worth items. any suggestion what we can do here, I wanna helight this further."
I ordered from pizza hut. Swiggy took very long to deliver it. The food was cold. I had ordered it for my child. It took almost an hour to bring that food.
Cheated me about gps location they are making me fool. In Gurgaon the gps taking the location of Hyderabad.
Ordered an ice cream from cold stone through SWIGGy .... Got the delivery with items missing from it and the quantity was very less ...felt cheated .....and the their customer service is also pathatic ...  After complaining the C's executive says it will refund 50 rupees instead of rectifing their mistake...as if the customer is hard up for that money.  Imagine how much of money SWIGGy is making by cheating it customers of about rs.50 to rs. 70 from each customers.  SWIGGy delivers about 1 million +orders per day ... ...even 20% of deliveries they cheat it about 1 crore +...easy way of making money
"Swiggy is a very good app, online food delivery, fresh food is delivered in it, the order reaches in just 30 minutes, it is fast nothing and you also get offers using which we can receive our orders in low price."
"Got to hand it to these guys!! They delivered my order to somebody else and then instead of reordering and delivering me urgently, wasted time saying sorry and they will refund the money in 4-7 days!! No food and wait for your money! They are thinking of IPO and being a listed company when they can’t even do their job right!! They don’t even know the basics of customer service!!"
"I orders a pizza from swiggy today..after waiting for 2 hours when i checked , it was showing that the order has been cancelled...when i talked to their customer support..they said the delivery guy tried to contact you but i didnot aswered his call..so he cancelled the order..what the hell..i didnot received any call from any one then how would i aswer them..now they have imposed a panelty of 84 ruppee on me for their mistake....go to hell swiggy..already uninstalled the app"
"Today I ordered pizza and unluckily dere was a hair in dat, and when I chat with one of the executive named Jennis, he was giving me a refund of 25 rs as m a beggar....  Cheating wid customers...  Will now uninstall d the app..."
"I had order from swiggy today at 3:57pm and my food got delivered at 5:40pm. The delivery guy doesn’t pick the phone and I was forceful been asked to cancel order and re-order and wait. This is not the first time I m facing issues with swiggy but the 5th time, hate the support and service."
"This is a very shitty app.Please don't use this app and get cheated, I orederd plate shawarma and they are sending me roll.plate shawarma was 180rs and roll is 100rs.And when on reaching customer care that is more pathetic.they are asking to write mail and on doing so they are just saying sorry and no solution provided."
After paying for food didn't get my food... I placed an order for food and restaurant receive my order after 40 minutes they show in app order received and after 15 they call and say unable to deliver your food because your food . get spoiled and restaurants which you order from is closed... And your money will refund after 7days... Now you tell me what should i do i don't have money because i already pay for my food. Just because of you i have to sleep hungry really suck... Pathetic worst
"Recently I tried many times to order from swiggy many times.sometimes, the app is not working properly , sometimes the food is not delivered on time , sometimes they show many offers but they are not available! They always give discounts but when it comes on festive time or end of the year swiggy app is completely shut down .and you can't avail the offers so it's a useless app to rely on instead of ordering a cold food . Moreover the delivery person they speak so unprofessional that you will feel bad at times!!!"
Recently I had ordered from Ovenstore from Swiggy. I ordered the food at 8:25pm and recieved the food 9:48pm. The food which I recieved was totally cold and an item missing from the order. Now when I am contacting the Swiggy customer care they are denying and saying that they cann't refund the amount without giving any specific reason.  I have been following up with the customer care they are not responding to me. In their refund policy they did mention that is any item is missing then they will refund but now they are denying.  @Swiggy.please refund the amount I paid for the food.
My experience with swiggy its too much disappointing I am constantly trying by chat an by email with customer care executive but they did not give me any answer only doing argument with me on dated 31.12.2019 I ordered party package in that 4items were missed and when I told them that items are missed in my order they said madam wait for 4:6 working hrs it’s will refund you. I said ok but today is 02.01.2020 almost 3days passed and I hv not receive my refund or any coupon my Order I’d - 60871447784  Here below I attached all chat an email conservation with them I have telephonic recording also which I ll send to Police Station now because now it’s too much
It is such a genuine online food purchasing platform with a really fast delivering service which have reduced a huge market and customer problem.
"Yaakkk!! Worst chicken biriyani I ever had was ""Bacchan Dhaba's"" chicken biriyani which I just ordered few minutes back for my dinner by swiggy mobile app. It was hard to eat and I left the meal uneaten as there was no potato, no egg, and the half boiled/cooked was highly rich with oil from bottom to top. It will be a total waste of time and money if you buy chicken biriyani from ""Bacchan's Dhaba"" a renowned restaurant in South Kolkata. I had a worst experience and I recommend no one to opt for the same."
Most irresponsible and dumb customer care service. They are just a bunch of liars who will keep on saying without checking that your order is on the way but your order will never reach you and then they will say can we cancel it after you already waited for hours.
"I ordered Briyani from Nizam, by mistake ordered 11 Biryani the payment got processed by one click as I use instant payment options. But we only wanted 6 mutton biryani and 3 chicken biryani from the same restaurant. The customer support was pathetic! Even after calling instantly they refused to modify and placed 50% as a cancellation charge. Support Agent - Mr Viplav showed pathetically bad behavior and was of no use. They call themselves the customer support team but actually don't do anything. Zomato gives excellent customer support and I would rather pay 100 bucks extra to them then order at Swiggy! because I know if I make a mistake they are there to help me out."
Dont make payment online before you got your order at doorstep..i ordered from Swiggy and make payment online but after 4 days i didn't get my order..when i complaint online they dont respond and start arguing give screenshots and all rubbish..when i gave them screenshots they people told to contact my bank and clearly denied and said its not there responsibility ..
Please stop ordering from Swiggy App..It has become pathetic these days.They do not bother if the customer complaints for the quality or for the missing items .Check the deals and the offers in Uber eats .where you don't find offers in Swiggy you will get the offer in Uber eats of the same restaurant
"They always give late delivery, and sometimes they cancelled from their side, they are showing 37 min and give delivery after 45min. Food was also cold. I m very disappointed . I give 2 point out of 10"
An order that was to be delivered in 39 was not even picked up after an hour. Swiggy is unable to handle the volume of business.
"At first, I ordered food, which was never delivered to me. It just came delivered. I realized they delivered to the wrong person. Next time, the guy dint have change, so swiggy forced me to cancel my order and took cancelation fees! I deleted swiggy from my phone, no thank you!!!! Very poor service, very poor food handling. Overall 0/10"
Swingy cheated to me same the deducted money from customers and delivered to order.  Proper responses also not provided to customers see how they are working?
I am a regular customer but this time i had issue with domino thr food partner n when i am trying to reach them numbers don't work n chat I have to repeat everytime n after some time they blocked me n it showed offline n said that I have had enough conversation with Dwight n can't continue... however there was resolution but swiggy felt that I am wasting thr time
Thanks for discounts ...fully satisfied with good delivery service and top restaurants food at rational price
"I placed an order on 22 dec 2019 for food from ""Go Gourmet"" resturant in Hau Khas, New Delhi and paid online. Then after the delivery boy from Swiggy delivered the order, he also took the money and left. I tried calling him  after 10 minutes to return the money but he did not take my calls. Then I contacted Swiggy through chat and they kept on assuring me for 3 days for refund and action against the delivery boy, but they keep promising to resolve my issue, but do nothing. I will never order order through Dwight again. They are cheats."
?+91 6359-600193? the bastrad dont know how to talk with customers... really feeling bad about swiggy tht this type of idiots are working over here dont know how to behave ... swiggy is a worst service
They just show the rating but not reviews. Got to order many things based on review and all are dissatisfied. Please don not do this show the actual customer reviews.
Today I ordered burgers from swiggy I was in office so the food had to be delivered to my home address. I updated the correct address I even cross verified not sure how this swiggy guys told I have updated incorrect address. Delivery was assigned to a particular person he did not come to deliver he sends someone else. They have some understanding and get into an agreement that the food should not be delivered to this person. I even told them I will come where ever u are to pick the food he first agreed and later cancelled my order in a span of 2 minutes. This means swiggy is a fraud they got cancellation money and the food as well. This is the 2nd time happening to me....... They are Fraudsters..... Cheap people they cheat with food....
"I have placed an order with these guys and they served stale food, later on, they want me to accept the stale food with a 50% discount voucher.  I objected that I want to speak to your customer service manager after 2 hours of discussion I Have been told that the manager doesn't speak to anyone. They are very proud of saying that this is their process and they got no shame to follow the same.  Order no: 60101583590"
Very bad delivery services once I got a different order and other time they delivered it somewhere else but I had paid it online I received a message but my account balance isn't changed. So I recommend people to pay cash if ever they order by swiggy or prevent ordering from this app
My Customers are there for project and I ordered evening snacks approx 600 rs online . The executive informed me that one line item was not there so the hotel agreed to replace it with other item and after 1 hr I get call from executive that the order is cancelled from Swiggy.  This was so frustrating that swiggy don't have value of time and they don't value customers. They treat as if they are giving free but they forget that they are earning from both customer and hotel along with delivery charges.  This type of treatment is not acceptable and will look in future not to order from swiggy.  They are not trustworthy and may cancel food so that kids/old people at home may die because of hunger.  Swiggy's Doom Day is very near.
"Just tried to order a food while travelling in a cab, the Swigy application took the address from where I started the booking instead of address that I entered manually and the delivery boy reached there for delivery, pathetic it is."
I ordered a cake zone chocolate jar. The delivery time was 45 mins. The delivery guy reached to different location and asked to pick the order. later he says I delivered but the person was not available at the loaction. Such a creepy ppl. My first experience was the worst.
I had previously placed an order and was delivered food that could not be eaten... Extremely cold lumpy and badly prepared food... This meal that I threw and send pictures as proof costed me 250 for which them gave me a coupon code to reimburse on the next order as an apology..  So I order from mcdonalds and spend 525 for a meal... When the delivery man comes to deliver he conveniently tells me mam I am. Sorry I dropped your cold drink... To which I said wait and you confirm this when I speak to an agent... To this I was rudely told return your meal and ask swiggy to refund the money. Upon calling swiggy they told me we are sorry please send us an email and well resolve this... And then I get an email stating sorry for the experience... Why do you guys ask us to send an email if you can only apologize and provide no resolution.... To this I asked for an escalation as i am done wasting money here.... I was again apologized to by a different agent.... What sort of a horrible customer service is this... Never had this experience with zomato... I have deleted swiggy from every family members phone and pro actively ensuring when my friends and I order we don't choose swiggy...
Worst food and poor response from customer care... Charging very high price  From my side they deserve zero star??????????
The services are going worse everyday. Pathetic company and worst management. The customer service executive doesn’t resolve your issues. The delivery executive misbehaves on calls. They directly say no to delivery the order. I am sure this company won’t go a long way as there services are getting really bad. I think we all should stop using Swiggy and should switch to zomato. The customer service executive is not ready to take the responsibility of his restaurant partner and the delivery executive and has simply said no to help. Kindly refer to the screenshot.
A very totally mad public of swigy i have given order they even not delivered my order and and from them side they have cancelled my order and that delivered boy Indrajeet sharma very rude person shouting on me and they have charged 130rs for my cancellation of my order i have not cancelled my order and they have not delivered my order very very third class service don't buy anything from on this... cheater public...??????????????????????????
"I order at 9:29 PM. ETA displayed was 34 minutes. I went busy with my daily stuffs eagerly waiting for a call about the order delivery. As soon the ETA of 34 minutes about to complete they revised it for another 20 minutes. again and again. At 10:15, I called the delivery guy. I called him consecutively 5-6 times for 20 minutes. But neither he picked up the call nor bothered to call back. I went simply angry of this and called the customer care. They too kept on saying that they will escalate the concern and asked for my next choice to reassign a new delivery guy or to cancel the order. Mean seriously? I would have done that before. I said them that I want updates on the action your team gonna take as I assure you that you people won't take any action else such thing would not have happened. They denied and reassigned a new delivery guy. They dont bother to reassign a new delivery guy in case one does not reach for the order pick up on time. They don't bother why someone would have placed an order, how it could've impacted them and what loss they might have to face. Food I was delivered too was cold enough. Seemed like they themselves have wrapped it and delivered."
"If you are ordering from this site, folk please beware they will make you wait for 3 hrs and still don't deliver your food. They are confused in themselves they don't know what is going on. wow please go ahead in the same way. If they have minus rating honestly i have given it. ??????????????"
"I've been using Swiggy for more than three years now and am fed up. I placed an order and the delivery guy cancelled it without my consent and was charged Rs 200 fine. Later on dialing the customer care, no one picked up. Why keep customer care if no one is going to be there.  Similar issues have happened with people I know.  The delivery guy does not deliver the food with proper packaging, and sometimes even spills everything over.  You should try to work harder on the customer service part. Just delivering the food without any care for how its being delivered to the customer is just plain irresponsibility."
I have lost my money as I received partial order from Swiggy.  I submitted my complaint to Swiggy. But there is no refund or reorder of my missing item.  The customer service only says : we regret for the inconvenience. That’s all.
I really appreciate their Support service!  Once I ordered food on wrong location still they where very co-operative and they cancelled my order and refunded me my money within an hour.
"I picked up some yummy chicken dishes from this place and I must say it was the juiciest chicken I had , all the kebabs I oredered were well cooked and delicious to have , also the pot biryani was so good in taste and I can’t wait to eat it again. Thank you For the amazing service Take away"
They cancel the order at the last minute when the customer is unable to even order from somewhere else as it's too late by then. And above all they are extremely unprofessional and unethical. DO NOT ORDER FROM SWIGGY
I m so much disappointed with this swiggy as ifcould I wish I have given (-) ratings to this swiggy...because not once it is twice or thrice that they have not refunded my amount due to various reasons... The recent one is I have ordered on swiggy... Amount deducted from my account....but the order was not placed...and no option was coming after it...new process started... When I complained about it they always says we will get refund in 3-4 days but it never does....really disappointed... I always suggest my friends not to use this app....they are just fake and never aable to give genuine reasons...
"When you get a wrong item after ordering on #swiggy and you raise this on the app, they ask you to take photos of the wrong item and you have to mention the name of the item you had actually ordered. I am assuming that this we are asked to do so because the person who eventually tries to resolve the case will already have the background of it.  The guy or chat representative or whatever they are called attends the chat, says, ""hi"", then asks me to wait. So I assume he is doing his homework on my case, NOW ......after having made me wait he comes back and says, ""can you please elaborate on the problem"", THAT JUST MADE ME BLOW MY TOP, obviously, I didn't spare him my thoughts on his inefficiency, AND then he says he will call me, and I asked him not to, I just didn't even feel like delving into it anymore, and yet he still fiscal me and asked me to explain my problem again. This time I was loud and told him to hand up immediately. I didn't take any replacement because I was fed up.  I am not sure if they are badly trained, callous or just overloaded with work but this is not the first time I have found an incompetent customer care person..........it happens everytime and sometimes they to force us the cancel the orders as well as a means of closing the ticket early. This is the first time I am adding a review online about any company at all, that's how angry I am.  #SWIGGY #CUSTOMERSERVICE just sucks."
"This is my second experience, I have stopped ordering from swiggy only becauseof location I am using so many other apps have no issues only with swiggy. I really dont understandhow they train their delivery partners .  For an example myntra delivery call me and verify is the location correct or not . I think I would suggestswiggy ppl to check on it .  Delivery partners are rude dont even attempts for other alternatives ."
"I am putting my following email to Swiggy.  I had very bad experience of the quite short food quantum delivered to me.I had ordered ""Chiken in green thai pot rice"" froNighr Evil Borivali West. The person delivered food.At the time of having dinner we realized that there were only 4 small chicken pieces left in the rice. When checked with the owner of restaurant he said the number of chicken pieces must be at least 10...means above 10.This is clearly a fraud from your delivery person. U take action or you don't.I hardly care.I have stopped ordering from you already."
"Recently I have ordered Domino's pizza from swiggy app, they took my order and after deducting amount from my account they cancelled my order. And telling that it will take 5 working days to refund. what a worst experience from them."
"I ordered food from UDUPI hotel and they did not have an item. I was asked to replace the item and for a difference of Rs. 5, I was asked to pay RS 72 saying coupon would not be applicable due to amendment. I was asked to cancel the order and reorder. I chose Adigas. Guess what the delivery boy dropped the food on the way. They replaced the order which took time. I agreed coz I was so hungry. Finally I received the order after 1 hour 45 Mins later. Again the best part is an item was missing from the order. They wouldn't replace it. Ideally I ended up being half hungry. Swiggy wants to gve a coupon instead of a refund. Like wow. Their have standard response for all questions. Crappy service."
"Order No. 59237393141  Delivery was done in one and half hour. delivery for food item with such delay is just too much. It is better to cancel the order then to deliver it.  And in return you are compensating with 50 rupees is just unacceptable.  You need to beef up your delivery system, guys."
I once ordered the food from swiggy where the packing was bad and the food was leaking in the cover which the delivery boy brought me and when I called back and said that the food got leaked he responded in such a way that the food was delivered and its not his fault so wont take the food back.
I hd ordered two items today afternoon for lunch at Hassan and I hd done online payment. But the delivery boy mohan Kumar g m has delivered Oly one item. But the other item was missing. Paise bhi Gaya khana bhi Gaya..
I ordered food through swiggy website from 4seasons in madhapur.The order was not informed by restaurant.I called the customer care and they said they will talk to restaurant partner . The food arrived on time but was very disappointed as there was no invoice of restaurant and no label of the restaurant on the food packet.So basically the SWIGGy agent bought the food from some other
"I'd one of the worst experience with Swiggy. On the same day, one of my order got cancelled and got the refund. Again ordered as I was starving and got spilt food. Got the refund with the system generated amount.  Later my account was disable, stating safety measures. Not sure what safety measure would this be. Later was asked to use other credentials to login, I deleted the app.  I had subscribed for Swiggy Super, which was valid till Jan 23rd, when asked for the clarity on how can I get that facility for new credentials, no response on emails.  This is not just 1st bad experience, it has happened multiple times. Once we even got stale food."
Ordered chicken lollipop it was all burnt and .  The on who was delivered the ordered asked for extra cash for delivering
Bad customer service...received poor quality food and unhygienic.when complain on swiggy thy said we r not cooking it.
I ordered chicken biryani but they bring veg biryani  When I contact to chat support they said write and email to support@swiggy.in when I send mail to SWIGGY they said simply sorry not do anything  My total money was waste
I always order food items on swiggy. They are providing discounts also. Timely delivery is given by their delivery boy . Always fresh and hot items are delivered at their home place.
You are good as long as you receive the order fine. Any mistake or any difference in delivery or any other issue then make sure you pay for it not swiggy. They will raise their hands. Waste having a support team...just for namesake. I got a wrong delivery of a lesser value...no refund. I cancelled an order even before the restaurant accepted it....no refund. All the chat executive knows is one statement - ' we have forwarded it to the concerned team'. Even if you are chatting with them their automatic reply keeps coming that chat will be terminated because of no response. The concerned team is concerned only on whether swiggy got its money. After these pathetic interactions i have uninstalled the app.
I did not receive food till 2 hrs because the delivery partner wasn't assigned. And at the end I had to cancel it as the customer care executive could not answer about how much time will it take. Unsatisfied with the custoner support. I won't recommend Swiggy to anyone henceforth
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE...THE DELIVERY GUY NEVER TURNS UP N WE HAVE TO PAY TWICE N THRICE FOR THE SAME  KINDLY DO NOT ORDER
"As I order pizza from SWIGGY , the order was confirmed but the order was not placed till happened last month and still I did not get the refund the worst customer service and not words to explain that this service is very waste..."
"Very worst service from swiggy, we ordered twice they didn't deliver properly.....don't order in swiggy fraud website....worst and they took money from us....."
I am a Swiggy Delivery Partner...  My ID was Deactivated by Mumbai Office just because I asked him for Bangalore HEAD OFFICE Email address to raise my issue further.  Is this correct...
This is Solomon from Hyderabad  I Ordered Choco Lava  It suppossed to be Hot and this is the second time ordered from cream stone  Better swiggy if you guys dont know how to deliver choco lava better remove that item.  Worst services ever.
Excellent food service app by swiggy partner it has provided several offers and great deals and has excellent service it has good response.
Services are good compaired to uber eats. Swiggy should be working more on delivery timing. Coupon code are of no use as prices are high compaired to compititors.
Hey guys all my family members are using swiggy .it provides fast and reliable service.  It increases the sale of restaurants and shops.  I love to ordered from it
They are thief. They only know how to cut customer money. They are only good for cash on delivery. But for prepaid customers they are only herrasing them. Plz its dont go for prepaid. They have charged twice for the  same and haven't delivered the order and cancelled my order by own and charged the cancellation fee 106 rs. Without any information.
"Swiggy needs to update the GPS Coordinates. Shows my location 6 kms away on map. Always delivery boys from far locations assigned for a delivery that’s less than 1 or 2 kms.  In all Software, Routing, GPS, Service needs to be improved way above today !!"
I was a regular customer of SWIGGy but today I decided to quit it. These people have tendency of deducting money from prepaid order for no fault of customers. If they can't deliver the order they shud inform it before payment afterwards it's very unprofessional to deduct money telling it's a customer s fault instead of improving their apps flaws. It's a very small amount to raise an concern but I am forced to do so as I think they should understand that it's painful to customer to face such issue.
I had ordered meal with complete address but the executive failed to find the location and may be gave reason customer cancelled the order which I dint cancel my order and they charged me cancellation charges this is completely fraud trying to make money I want my charges to be waived off ...not acceptable.  See into the matter and get it sort out earliest.
"I ordered crispy corn from The Red Dragon hotel, order received, but someone picks up my order I called to hotel owner no, but he cut my call I tried to call customer care, but they also cut my call when I explain everything  Even one knows who received my order.  I was waiting for 2 hours but still didn't get my order. When I call the second time to customer call, he was like someone received my order, and he rejects it we are not able to deliver that order to you.  Guys, what the hell he was talking. I have an inferior experience with SWIGGY I suggest no one should use SWIGGY"
Today I ordered meals at 12.15pm iam waiting still 2.30pm no response very very worst cheating fellows please don't order any food worst
I ordered food from Murugan idly Porur Chennai the address I have given wrong street without getting annoying the person came and gave the food within less duration I thought to give rating for that person 5 by mistake it was gone as 1 . Again it is impossible to give rating I Know. That's y am giving review.
It's really stupid of this app to make such a nuisance when ordered in the night and they give to it to someone else and she asks me to cancel my order and then re order that at night 10.30?? and then what shel deliver my order at 12 ?? Stupid swiggy....how is it possible for some other delivery guy to pick up my order?? shows how dumb they are. it's clearly seen on the app that my order is been preparing all of a sudden my order is delivered to someone else??
"I have ordered pizza from this stupid company and they have delivered biscuits with cheese and which was smashed and stinky , when i called them they simply denied to refund my money back.... it's very hard to spend on something what we like cuz we are middle class family and they are taking advantage of it  I have attacattached email also see and also the quality of food ... I'm patient and that I told them still they were so rude to me"
At prest it is not solved 19th november 2019 I chat with swiggy app and customer care executive said the problem resolve 3 to 4 working days. but I am very unsatisfy I usually use this app but this type of issue
Sabse jada kharab service ha swiggy ki.  Order cancellation charge 50% . it is totally process for making fool.
"Everytime I ordered, it shows food has been delivered after waiting for almost an hour but actually I didn't receive order anytime... Delivery person never answer any of the call and on calling customer care they will keep you on hold everytime and thn they will say the same that we are unable to reach delivery guy please place the order again as if we have no other work to do.  It's been happening everytime many of my friends have the same issues with this swiggy.  So don't swiggy it  Worst service app"
I am a regular customer at Swiggy. And the service is good. There was this time when I ordered a Pastry and the order got placed twice due to some technical error. The delivery boy was good who helped cancel the duplicate order. Highly recommend this app. GIving 4 stars because there are less in-app offers.
"I have ordered in swiggy, the delivery executive didn't check the delivery address and he reached to my old address, as I have experienced this, I called swiggy desk and I ensured that the delivery guy delivers to correct address. After 15 min getting call from delivery executive saying he is near my old address.  I told h my son is waiting for food I am in office kindly deliver to the new address which is 20 min from old address.  He refused, again spoke to swiggy e"
"A couple of times, I ordered something and I got something else. When you contact customer care, they say that they can't do anything about it. And that they will serve you better in the future. I'm so sick of it. They call themselves service providers and they are bad as they get. Well, I'd choose uber anyday over swiggy."
"I had placed an order from Domino's pizza, Kodambakkam branch, Chennai, Tamil Nadu on 21/11/19 at 16:57 pm through Swiggy app (it stated that it would be delivered by your representative) It was stated that the order would have reached us by 17:27 PM. However the order was delayed by nearly 2 hours. I had dialled the toll-free helpline number for assistance for which the call was disconnected when I was given a reply of 'please hold while we check the status' by your representative and was of no avail.  I had order from your outlet knowing it would be the perfect food to satisfy my hunger but instead I was let down in a horrible manner. The food has reached by 18:14 PM. The food which we got had dried cheese, stale garlic bread and hard crusted pizza which was difficult to eat. I had no other choice rather than to discard the order. I didn't expect such sort of experience with Domino's and I am utterly disappointed. I hope this delay in delivery doesn't damage your reputation and I hope you take necessary steps to prevent this occuring again. Such a disgrace to a well known outlet and a franchise"
"Very bad experience, not giving responsibility, they even didn't return my money, what kind of service is this?"
I have ordered non veg wraps and burgers they have ordered veg at 12.27am after waiting for 33 mins in the night . When I called and did chat refused to help said you have got the right order . Confirmed with restaurant . They are insane who don’t trust their customers . I have deleted thier app . No more using swiggy. It should be closed and there should be new app instead of swiggy who will more willing to help
"Order #57331260665  I placed an order at swiggy. Before the restaurant confirmed the order, swiggy org assigned the delivery boy to the restaurant. Swiggy app  showed waiting time 45-50 minutes, so I tried calling driver several times but he did not attend my call. The restaurant where I ordered  the food is just 2 minutes walk from my house but in the app it showed close to 1 hour time, so I cancelled the order before the restaurant  confirmed it, but swiggy made a cancellation fee of Rs.170 for no reason. And the driver attended my call before cancelling the order,  he said, Restaurant will take more time to confirm and prepare the food.  I called up the customer service and the executive was unable to help. Hence got connected with Manager and he was extremely rude and said he will not be able to help me in this and I owe the cancellation fee.  I have been a regular customer of Swiggy placing an order almost every single day and this is not acceptable.  Please advise on this matter to your associates and I am writing this in the customer review content on all the online content to help customers understand about the issue."
"Delivery exec`s are horrible, had to cancel my orders a gazzilion times and refund was never made . no direct number to contact the office. exec`s ask us to cancel orders and we never get our money back. am never ordering here again"
Received Rasmali with Worm ordered from shyam sweets from sector 14 Gurgaon.Its totally surprised when I open rasmalai bowl and see worm which is on top of the bowl.Kindly see in pic what I am sending it to you.
They not delivered my order and they cancelled my order without informing me. And giving rubbish reasons I'm not received there phone call. And they not called me at all. I only call back them. How they are making full to there costumer..
"Yesterday, I ordered a product on swiggy. But I didnt received the ordered product. They have served me the product that was ordered by me. The delivered products were very poor quality. I have to throw them into dustbeen. This was not eatable. I complaint to customer support of swiggy. But from there, I didnt get a satisfactory reply. I have personal experience and suggestion that Uber Eats is quite better than Swiggy. I will never recommend such type of careless company to anyone. I will never do any future purchase with this company."
"I have been a loyal customer of swiggy for the past month. I have seen that almost 5 orders were either delayed, or not delivered at all. 2 out of the 5 times there was a delay for almost and in the last minute they say the delivery executive has met with an accident. When asked they seemed to be least bothered and told to wait another for the order to come. Yesterday I used swiggy to order Domino's Pizza, since nothing is directly connected so couldn't call the swiggy customer. They( Domino's) took almost 2 hours to just deliver pizza! But kind enough the company has offered a compensation.  Today when I ordered for a simple veg thali today, the app kept showing that the delivery is en route the restaurant. Suddenly I get a call from the executive talking in a language I did not understand so called customer care and when they spoke, the customer care tells me that the delivery boy doesn't want to deliver! I mean is that even logical! The address was shown clearly and the delivery executive he doesn't want to! That's the most unprofessional answer to get. I think guys at swiggy should get these guys in senses. This is the last time I'm ever ordering from here."
The quality of food offered through swiggy is sick. Stale rotten food. The worst platform to order food from. They only say that your feedback is important and we will pass it on. They don’t do anything
"I am very disappointed with the services of Swiggy. Aain, delivery time is been crossed consecutively since last 2 days and while speaking with Customer care the on it standard statement heard of is "" Apologies for the inconvenience "" . I really doubt if Swiggy team takes our feedback seriously .  I feel the coordination with Swiggy team and restaurants are not in sink and we are the poor victims.  No value for money:-("
Swiggy chat only favour restaurant not customer i had paid 670 rs and still casual response mf need feed back in 100 words
"We ordered on swiggy, not only did they deliver the order late but also missed a lot of the main items in the order when spoken about it to the swiggy valet, he responds in a very rude way and slams our door.  Our order no: #57036810964  The customer care pays no heed to our issues and just after along chat of automated messages, says that we may try to refund and the chat message on the swiggy app is your proof. Cheats I say."
Swiggy made legal clause as per their requirements. If you read that I bet you will never use their app.
"I am an international student here in Gujarat, I was always ordering from Swiggy.  I never seen rudest and unrespectfull drivers like that. I talked to the customer service this time about a driver who gave me the food without even looked at me because he was talking to another Swiggy drivers, so I had to put the money in his hand while he kept talking to them. After the other drivers left, he looked at the money and he told me that he was sorry because he didnt have money change?!  I told him you could have had asked for money change from the other drivers but you didnt even looked at me neither the money. Many many other story! So no Swiggy no more"
"I had ordered food from a restaurant which is around 10 KM away from my home. The swiggy person called me after sometime and said you have set a wrong delivery address and we can’t come there, they also told me that they will charge 60 INR as the food has already been prepared. I tried to convince them that I provided the correct address and if they can’t find me in GPS it’s their problem.  But they didn’t listen to me and just said they can’t come and will also charge the money as cancellation charge. I did call up the customer care but they also said the same thing and didn’t even show any interest to my problem.  I never experienced such horrible management and poor customer service from Swiggy. Sometimes they should also think about customer satisfaction beyond profits and money."
"I just order from swiggy a tamato pizza and it's just approrached to me on time, and first time they got me 50% off on first time ordering any kind of food, I'm thing they should reveled more option like discount offer and their app. bt the way, service of them is splendid and marvellous and courier boy dedication on his job is very best so keep in contact with us  Thankx and regards  Akhil"
"I have ordered from Swiggy several times. One the honey chilli potatoes tasted like crap. The food was cold.  Today, I ordered Magic Platter from Burger Club, GTB. I have eaten the same in the cafe as well. Burger Club is a fraud as they gave me invariably less quantity of food. Also, their veg burgers taste like stale and bad food."
"While my family uses Swiggy a lot I just wanted to share that a swiggy delivery chap on his bike, while riding really fast ON THE WRONG SITE OF THE ROAD, almost ran me over today at 1245 pm opposite MK Retail on CMH Road. Please educate your drivers to follow the traffic rules. I hope someone from the company cares enough to read this and take some action. I was just lucky to not be an accident victim today."
They never meet SLA...that is far thing ..their delivery person never reach properly to the location and tells my address is showing wrong.. delivery person's attitude is rough don't understand any language..at last they cancel order and charge cancellation charges from customer. a thief company will show you discount and steal your money..this is in reference to my latest order no( Your order #56462458778 has been cancelled. You will be charged Rs 61.0 as cancellation fee.)
"Heloo this id hina,  On 10 th nov i was orderd on swiggy.  As I was tracking my order, I saw myself that the delivery track is going in wrong direction & I called myself & the delivery boy refused saying he misunderstood & your order will be cancelled so I contacted helpline & that too was not useful  I demand that I should be compensated for staying hungry & having been accused falseley.  Attached is the phone call details with the delivery person & further my chat with the Swiggy helpline.  Varry varry bad services by staaf and help line. Customwr care exicitive didnt any help , and they were changing thair reply often time they don"
"Swiggy service is very worst due to below reason    Most of the time amount deducting but order not placing, and refund also take more time, more than 10 days.    There is no guarantee that we are getting food from same restaurants as there no receipt proof. In handwritten bill they are providing some time there is no restaurant logo    Customer care people not responding properly    If there is any issue in order and if we raise concern no one calling and explaining what issue happened.    If order cancelled simply sending sms or mail saying order cancelled. If we are not checked our mobile then we will not came to know order has been cancelled."
My experience with Swiggy till now has been gr8. The delivery was on time. The food was yummy n fresh.But today unfortunately their was some miscommunication with the delivery address given. The delivery person had spoken very rudely with me which was really inappropriate.
"I have never seen this type of service even with customer care also. Scenario is when we order food estimated time 30mins, when we call the agent after 30mins he was saying somebody else took the order and in second case some other agent said he kept our food in bike somebody else took the bike. What the fu they think of ourselves and those fu idiots swiggy are dependent on us, when we call them to return the money they says it will take 4-7 working days. How do we look like tothem. Why am so much frustrated is when we order the food time is 10pm and we have a kid waiting for food which is not acceptable. My sincere request to all of you guys who is going to order in swiggy. Try to avoid these idiots swiggy people as they don't have any control on their agents. Thanks"
"Hi all, in last week itself I faced three times problem with swiggy. One time they called and said your package was took by another guy after 30 mins , secondly yesterday I ordered sub from sub way with package spillage issue also sub was not customized one which I kept and finally today I ordered pan cake they delivered red velvet cake. Everytime they have only one word that we wont repeat but very next day they are repeating"
I ordered veg sub from subway.cold food provided...it was not fresh .the delivery was ok but i am not satisfied with the product
"If order is not available at restaurant, Swiggy hardly inform customers and we have to contact them. Even sometimes you have to pay for cancellation charge even though its swiggy fault. Many times order was not available in restaurant but Swiggy will show that on their website menu."
"Wrost food delivery app. Wrong, cold, stale food delivered every time even after giving instructions before delivery. Packing always an issue after paying extra charges. Wrost Customer service, poor management and when you ask about refund or compensation for the wrost food items than they only refund you Sorry, Apologies etc. and close the chat without giving satisfactory solution."
Served by low quality restaurants and shops.  Food will be worst quality you have ever tasted in your life.  Very highly priced.  Once i was very hungry and i ordered different items from around 3 different restaurants and threw everything into dustbin.
"Waited for a lot of time, cancelled the order. Probably they take a bigger cut on each order, restaurants are not interested in supplying to swiggy"
"I order food through swiggy app, order got confirmed, message popped up that order had been picked up by delivery boy, after five minutes ETA was 1 min, after 5 mins still ETA was 1 min, so I called the delivery boy, he told he that my order had been cancelled as my building name was not there in the delivery address and my cell number was not reachable. So delivery boy and customer support executive cancelled the order, I was asked to go the restaurant to check what went wrong, I reach the restaurant and found that order had been picked up.  when restaurant owner asked the delivery boy where is the food he said he had dropped parcel to kandivali swiggy hud, we all were surprised to that delivery boy had reached to kandivali in 15 mins from Miraroad, guess swiggy had provide private jets planes to their delivery boys.  I got one mail and one message that I will be charged 200 rs in next order as I cancelled the order.  Swiggy has all the details of customers, telephone numbers, mail id, full addresses then why this happened I havn't ordered my food for first time through swiggy, if building name is not there so what rest of the address is there in delivery address, delivery boy can ask to customer support for the building name, suppose mobile network is not there and they cant communicate, cant they wait for 10 mins. Customer support and delivery boys can communicate and delivery the food. Not a very big information is missing, if we want we can make it happen, if we want to fool ppl will keep doing it  .  This whole drama happened within 20 mins after delivery boy picked the order.  Really very surprising.  Swiggy sucks, You ppl are make money, dont forget its business, if such things stays happening, You will be out soon. I wish ppl should throw you out from the market."
App food photos are presentable but actually send packaging in carry bag... worst customer care.  Delivered unhygienic food and not same which was ordered. They don't have any control over food shops.  They will not support you if anything goes wrong only try to convince you to accept it.
"I think swiggy hire uneducated , mentally insane people , they don't know how to talk with client they don't how to behave delivery boy was so annoying not ready to deliver food to my home and keep arguing that you come here I don't understand there policy why would I pay delivery free if they don't deliver to home!! Shameful swiggy #  Order no - 55871194089"
After all getting of my live location I ordered and later got i massage saying our tried calling u and u didn't respond the call. If due to network there might have problem. But there was alternative number to call and address mentioned is right but after calling him saying the address was wrong and after asking him in detail saying security said that A106 flat doesn't exist feeling very sad after waited waited n waited n
"Placed order from a place for 365 rs , the guy dint give change for 500 and he left. There is no option to call them and while chatting the respondent is hardly bothered to resolve issue. She went missing for a good 10.mins  Comes and responds and when she feels like. Absolutely horrible customer service and no prompt response either. Such a BS situation"
Swiggy order no. 55753253988 I received the food labelled with zomato cover and I received the food is not good and every item which I order got cold.
In system the app is not taking the location whatever we want .for that they cancelled the order and they charged 118 rupees . very very waste service . next time onwards we wont trust swiggy and we wont order anymore .
When the swiggy service is started at my near hostel I fell very happy. Because of that they give 50% if first order and they will provide the food at door step very fast. There is no service charge also. So that time me ans my freinds are really addicted to swiggy  But slowly they started to charge service charge and other expenes. The charged amount is morethan acutal amount of the goods and the quantity very less and they failed to provide the product at door step.for collecting the food I need to go the some place. Its so irritating. So now I stop to use swiggy.
Swiggy is having worst service across location.  1) They don't deliver food on time  2) They will cancel the order with some stupid reason at last moment.  3) Some time food item will go missing.
I ordered two items from swiggy. I got one item that I did not order at all. Swiggy provided replacement for the wrong item. But they did not give me refund for the missing items. What this means that Swiggy is taking my money and not delivering me anything in return.
"Swiggy is a fraud company and doe snot have any process and systems. Most of the time they rely on poorly paid executives to delivery. This is a horrendous things going on if you see how they delivery. The CEO has made enough money is now planning to merge while customers are treated badly.  There are so many refunds and technical issues, poor systems etc.  Request you to pelase shut down this service. Zomato is too good!"
"Swiggy Home screen advertised free home delivery on fruit and vegetable shops. On clicking on this link i came across 3 store options, ordered fruit as required. No where did they mentioned that delivery will be changed. Swiggy executive reaches the store, buys the stuff & uploads the bill. At the time of payment 70 Rs were added to bill amount as delivery charges.  Pathetic customer service, the agent did not understand the issue raised."
Food was found opened when delivered. Second time food packing and quantity was very poor. Swiggy is cheating. They should shutdown there business as they cannot handle customers. Very bad experience. Swiggy is sending half eaten foods to customers. Opened food.
I ordered pizza through swiggy app. Order was confirmed by dominos. Then after 30 min Dominos team called me and said your order can't possible to deliver and they cancelled these ordered. After I am asking about refund to swiggy they couldn't response me they don't know who will refund that money.
Dont order from swiggy this is fresh post 2019 . They dont provide refund my order #55437215977 still not get refund they are cheating.
IAm living in chennai I have ordered chicken tandoori half but the have mentioned that buy1 get1 free in the app and in the bill but I received only one I don't need refund I need another one worst delivery app among all app  Worst worst delivery app both of them cheated me and my money
"Hello Friends! Swiggy is growing like an ant on sugar, In his app there are multiple of restaurants which can serve our food through swiggy delivery boys, delivery services is very fast as comparison to other online food order platforms, Yesterday I ordered Paneer Makhni( Punjabi dish) which I have received with in a 10 minutes . That's why I use swiggy app most for food delivery to us."
"Very bad experience with Swiggy. ordered food at 9:50Pm and after wait of 1 and half hour it was forcefully canceled from your support team by me for some silly reason that some other picked up the order. And no compensation for customer after 1 and half hour hunger wait. Again reordered and It showed 25min and after completion of 25 min it again says 25 min total 50min, again and again, shows 30 min so again total 130 min. So Im waiting since 9:50PM and order is going to come at 12:15AM. Later when I called Delivery Executive, he says order will be delivered at 1:00AM. Is this the proper service from swiggy that too 2 times in a row for a delivery distance of 1.5-2 km between restaurant and delivery location and a delivery fee of 40/-. Seriously worst and bullshit is my words and cant say more beeps. Good Bye Swiggy. Thanks for the timely dinner to the customer."
"This is second experience I am having with Swiggy.  They are showing status on portal that order is being prepared and if you call restaurant they say there is no one form Swiggy to pick up. it is one of the renowned restaurants. When you call Swiggy delivery boy number given he doesnot pick then after 10 calls he says bike issue and he has picked food.  I am never going to try Swiggy again, it is horrible."
"I am regular customer of swiggy and I have ordered many dishes. I had ordered some foods worth of 1165 and I didn't got the food in time. So I cancelled the order and requested for refund. Swiggy said that my amount would be refunded within 7 or 8 working days. The incident happend on 6th July. So far I haven't got my money back. I contacted swiggy severel times, every time they responded saying that the amount is been sent to your account. When I contacted bank they said we have not received any entry. Now today is 25th oct. I don't know whom to contact for this. This is pathetic."
"We have ordered food (order Id:54828216055) from Meat and Eat restaurant, Urapakkam, Chennai through Swiggy. I was waiting for the order more than one hour and in their update, it said the food will arrive in 21 mins so due to that false update, i was waiting for the order but after one hour, i got call from irresponsible Swiggy saying that restaurant is having some power issues and it will take about another 1 hour!. We were waiting for food for my kids and that was fustrated even more. This will be my last order in this Swiggy."
"Swiggy, you buggers have a cut in every meal we buy. For 200 bucks biryani how the heck will you charge 250 and charge a delivery fee for that. I witnessed your scam. I was counting stars no wonder you buggers pay your delivery guys such hefty salary. ..  You buggers should be shut down for the scam."
"I am really very dissatisfied with swiggy service. I just ordered something and it was showing resturant accepted the order and will deliver in next 30 min , payment was also done through paytm, I waited for more than 30 min , then I received a call from delivery boy hi said""mam apka order aya th pr resturant to band hai vo order nhi de rhe ""  Suggestion: if you cant deliver any order on time then plz don't accept the orders and make people fool's  Now best part is i am trying to give 1 star its not clickable 3 starts are sets in default."
"Hate the tie up coordination of Swiggy. Twice in a week visited the office, fill up the information still don't get any calls from their side.  Why you guys have two office address in Indore if you don't have a time to look forward to the queries of the customers."
"I have ordered food from swiggy and when the delivery guy picked up the food I was tracking incase he needs help I called him when he was 12 minutes away he hasnt picked up my call and then suddenly on swiggy app it was showing the food was delivered. Then I called the delivery guy again few times but he has disconnected my call and then had a chart with swiggy they said they can't do anything so they will refund the money...I never wanted my money back, I was waiting for the food from 40 minutes suddenly they came with a surprise of enjoy your undelivered food."
Horrible uneducated ppl  For cx service  Called customer support 4 times  They just want my order to b cancelled  N refunded in 2to 4 days...y...cheater...  When u ppl took my money quickly  Make a stytem to refund I want my order
Restaurant menu price different  Swiggy price different  Swiggy charge extra Rs.40 or 50 for one food  Total fraud and chor delivery company
It is very slow on service the delivery time is very slow although quality of food depends on the restorent so the quality is same in all food delivery company is approximately same. So I don't recommend you because it doesn't give some discount to there existing users. The delivery charges is also high as compere to other's .  Support and service is OK I have no problem about payment and delivery other than time issue.  Satisfied- Definitely not satisfied with offers and delivery time.
"Folks,  I would want to give -5000 rating as we dont have an option I did not - had very worst experience with SWIGGY.  I have ordered(order number - 52666058896)for food in SWIGGY on 27th September 2019 from T-Grill Good Restaurent in Hyderabad for Rs=925/-  There was a promotion running on which for 75 rs - when I made a internet banking payment for Rs 850/- Payment failed - for some reason [AMOUNT DEDUCTED FROM MY ICICI BANK ACCOUNT] - then I tried with another payment method CC - again failed -[ I got a message saying the PROMOTION is APPLIED every 2 HRS only] then I opted for Cash on Delivery option - as it too late for our dinner we were all hungry.  Problem 1: I have not received my refund till today 14 oct 2019 - when I contact customer chat via app - the executive says you refund had a technical issue - it will process 7 working - I dont know - how many 7 working - still I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MONEY BACK  Problem 2 - I see this transaction as very clever way of attracting people by giving a promotion and declining payments - and make them pay via other payment methods( so that the promotion will be applied for only once in 2 hrs when your payment failed - the promotion will not be applied with the next payment as it shows the promotion is used already - an I need wait for 2 more hours to get the promotion which obviously you cannot wait to hungry for 2 hrs)  Since because of NO Strict guidelines and rules - these online companies cheating customers like anything - if a company cannot handle a payment issues - always saying technical issues for the last 3-4 weeks - I suspect something is fundamentally wrong with the intention of SWIGGY - the amount of stress I had to speak to 10 times is of no use - finally I advised the executives to work for a better company who treats customer well"
"Today, my order are changed  My order no is #53970091793  & my order is 2afghani stuffed chaap& 1 masala stuffed chaap  Order is receive 1 masala chaap& 2 afghani chaap  Anybody not response this order  Swiggy is fake & chor company 4 times faced same problem nobody take a action"
"They have deducted money through net banking and got messages as ‘ net banking transaction was not successful’. Hence, proceeds the order with cash payment. When checking the support, they updated as amount would be refunded back in 7 days. Even after passing 12 days, I am still waiting for my money..."
I ordered some food on 29th of Sept 2019 from bengal sweet corner using swiggy...however money was deducted from my account and no order was received by me...later on I got a sms from swiggy that if any amount deducted from your account will be credited within 5 to 6 business days into your account...as of now neither refund nor any text or sms received by me from swiggy...second time again I faced the same problem when I ordered food on 3rd of October 2019 from kabila restaurant but it was not delivered to me..later on I got msg that your order has been cancelled and amount will be refunded soon...no amount recieved so far...swiggy doesn't have any contact number where u can contact ...in chat they will just try to make u fool by saying that u should contact your branch for refund..it's funny and pathetic at the same time...never gona use this service provider again and I personally suggest avoid using swiggy as your money matters a lot you but swiggy doesn't care once amount is deducted from your account....worse experience u had with them coj I faced same problem twice and I know that I will not get money back. But will be careful in future from this kinda unprofessional company...thanx
"They are not good managers or suppliers, I order at 9:51 they cancel my order at 11:40 with no reason  They think we are fools  We have to stop usingswiggy they learn good"
"I wish I can rate them zero ! I am the regular customer today I have experienced horrible service! I ordered food at 3:15 expected delivery time shall be at the max 40 mins ! Sad part is the restaurant is close by to my place! Firstly they assigned my order to some one that delivery guy didn’t bother to pick up the order which was clear in the tracking status, further it was assigned to some one else he took when we called at 3:50 that delivery boy was still at his house! Finally the order arrived by 4:25 which is absolutely insane! Listen if you cannot keep your customer happy! No point what eve your position in the market !"
I placed order of sweets through Swiggy at Nandhinee Sweets at 11.15 am and cancelled the same at 11.15 am. I was not informed about the cancellation fee while cancellation and instead I was told that the entire order value will be credited back(screen shot is attached).  I wanted to order some other sweet and placed order again with other sweets. Please note that the order value is Rs.876/- and they credited only Rs.438/- and informed through message that Rs.438/- is deducted against cancellation fee. Please help me to get my money back.  I didnt order any food item to be prepared hence there is no question of loss for restaurant. They are cheating
"Swiggy has made me addicted to online ordering. Earlier I used to hardly order online. After Swiggy, I keep ordering online.So addictive."
You guys should shut down your services because your whole so called tech team is mentally and physically challenged. Their brains are fried. These tech guys of yours cant even get a customers address correctly done. Because of you morons I got my order cancelled 4 times in a row. Close down your services if you don't know how to do business.
"I have try to placed order on 27 sept but three times payment deducted from my account but order still showing payment failed error. todays have 12-15 days completed but till not have any refund on my account, I have tried to contact there customer executive but still no reply,  Poor support system I want to suggest you dont use swiggy for online food ordering use someone else."
I placed order of 2 items restaurant tool my order and I have been waited since 50 mints after that they told me that restaurant was closed. worst services and worst support
First the serving of the food by swiggy was good. But nowadays the discount are reduced and they dont deliver the food on time also. The quantity of the food has also decreased.
One of the worst experiences keep you waiting for food because of the system failure no one should use this service most pathetic
"I have ordered meal from Mcdonalds and after 1 hour of order, status was changed to ""Delivered"" without delivering the food. I had started reaching to customer support, they are so slow and not bothered about customer. They responded after 5-10 mins that we'll check and after chatting with them for 50 mins, they responded with 3-4 liners only and after 11, they asked me for refund / compensation. My order value was 176 and they had given me coupon of 175 Rs as compensation(no refund of actual money). These guys are making fool and they are fraud.  Please don't use Swiggyyyyy."
So hello friends I am back with another bad experience from theese online businness and today I have just faced and issue from swiggy .  So I am personally from a city where swiggy was just announced or swiggy has just started selling in my city .  I ordered some food from swiggy and you all know that at the starting time they just give great offers and I got 50% off on my order  I was happy about my first order but they show their real face now  Ist I got a message that my food was arriving in just 30 minutes  Than I got a call from swiggy that the rider with my food had his bike puncutered and he cant come and my money would be refunded . I didnt knew their strategy so I ordered food again as I had 5 coupnes of  ORDER50 by which I could get 50 % of 5 times but now only four were left  Again it said my food will be delievered in just 30 min but a call came and it said that the rider with my food just had an accident and they are cancelling my order  Now I started to understand the strategy and than I ordered food again with only 3 coupons left  Now this time I had a plan  I called the rider himself who took my order according to them  He said that he had not taken any order and he was sleeping in his home  And now I understood all the strategy of reducing my coupons and not delievering the food  These are the worst webcites that just make you fool  I you also had such experienced tell me in the comments section so that they could improve their service  Thanks
"I ordered some food they are not following locations simple saying ur location in other places i west my time and money one of the wrost service in my life never see before they argument with me for cancel order i never use swigy in my life,"
The Rava idli from Krishna bhavan was having an Insect ?? on it. It is not expected that foods are prepared so carelessly.
"My son ordered some dishes for me. The executive delivered with Zomato Stickers and without a bill from hotel we ordered.  I don't understand whether the swiggy overtaken zomato or zomato overtaken swiggy. Anyways I don't take orders which are delivered without bill.  Priory also I had same experience and for that I repented after having that low quality food. I request friends not to order any food from swiggy as there is no more trust involved in it.  Also I don't understand whether the person is really from swiggy as there is no any proof of I'd card or Visiting card.  We cannot blame the totally on the company, but the system what they are having needs to assessed from their side."
My order placed n the executive took nearly more than an hour and at last they came with very simple line . Sir due to technical issue the order is cancelled you order again . I m going to take legal action against them dis is something which has repeated again n again
Swiggy me work krte huye 5 month ho gye mujhe jb bhi koi problem aati h fleet manager kbhi bhi use solf nhi krte h kaam me regarding abhi monthly insensitive bhi kaatiya Mera 1000/- rs koi help hi nhi krta.
Hi  This is to inform everyone that do not order from swiggy as I have been ordering from them from las 2-3 months but on 8september at 3:28 am I placed the order as of late order their was no cod available so I paid from GPay for 328 RS which was deducted from my account but due to some technical fault from their side my order was unable to be placed and they told that the refund has been initiated but nothing done as so it's already been more than 20 days for the same issue they said takes 4-5 business days and the employee s are non responsive and absert and not able to understand the issue
Horrible app. Uneducated delivery people who cant read google map. Order only if you dont want to recieve it
"Wow... Great that you people are providing ridiculous customer service!!!  I frequently order in SWIGGY, though I order from my residence n office I have added two different address.. Sometimes in hurry we forget to switch the address.. I did the same n I agree it was my mistake.. But after waiting for one hour you guys are calling n confirming the address.. Why didn't you do that before.. kindly call the customer n confirm the address because most of them does this mistake.. And after waiting for such a long time you guys are cancelling the order, however it's just 3km away from my residence.. Thanks a lot for your poor service.."
Disappointed with the customer service. Excuses given for every bad service but no improvement in the quality
"Bullshit Service and food .Pathetic people  worst service, takes 2 hours to deliver  many times we get food got delivered notification but never gets the food then also they dont refund the money.  Fraud Comapny"
The delivery person are asking for the mode of payment and if you have told them that it is online the delivery person has escaped without giving the order..happened many times...worst service
"Swiggy is looting from people in the name of offers like SWIGGY30, SWIGGY40, SWIGGY50 etc.  First they keep the inflated menu charges and then they apply discount on the order.  For example, Hyderabad Eats restaurant when you go, the Veg Biriyani price is 90 INR, and on the Swiggy it is 180 + Delivery Charges+Restaurant Charges  On this when you apply 30% coupon you would get a discount about 55 and still it is inflated Price.  Such a cheap Business Tricks. they think we never visit the restaurants and we would never know the original price tag of the Menu. what a petty SWIGGY  You Lost my Trust and if you continue to do the same, you would loose trust of people. and there are big names went down in the history when they loose customer confidence"
NO CO-ORDDINATION BETWEEN DELIVERY BOY AND CALLCENTRE. THIS IS THE 3RD TIME FACING EXACT SAME ISSUE AND NO POINT COMPLAINING AS YOU GET SAME TYPED MESSAGED GIVEN BY THEIR CEO! ITS AMAZING THAT THIS CRAPIS STILL SELLING!  WORST!WORST!WORST  PLEASE SHUT DOWN!
Swiggy took so much time to assign delivery boy to my order. Then delivery boy was not following directions instructed by me. He was not speaking properly and asking me to cancel the order even after wait almost an hour.. my order cancelled by swiggy on 3rd august 2019 and today its 26th sept they haven't even refunded my money. And giving me fake refund id... And also sending me msg of delay in refund and still asking me to wait more 5 days.. @100/- rs is not big amount to me but if they are fooling people like me then this people are really dump...??
"They always cancel food saying the delivery guy can't come n refund half of the amount, and the customer service is worst than anything. They don't respond properly at all. Wish I could give a zero. I have uninstalled the app, will never ever order from them  000000000000000000000000000000000000 BIG ZERO"
"Ordered food from swiggy... Delivery guy cald n tld me he cnt come near ma place, other guy vl deliver it. Cald cx serv rep lied to me dat fud vl b n 2-3 mins, nbdy came, ordr was canceled, they tuk 2k dnt pay me bk, cld anthr cc rep, he was soo rude, gave false info n discnctd my cal saying he cnt help, his name is Sunit, d reps giv diff ans n lie. The rep named sunit was abusive towards me. He said he will not do anything on the call and he disconnected my call. I dont think the calls are being monitored, n he does not even knw to utter an alphabet in english forget about speaking, he also was murmuring swearwords at me."
Yee swiggy jyesa faltu company ni milega aap ko khana order karo paisa dubao.  samajhdar kabhi swiggy se order ni karenge.  gawar hi order karo aur paisa lutao.
"The company should have a point of contact in such a scenario where the delivery guy is moving like a turtle to pick the order. I had to call CCD to know the whereabouts of my order and they informed its ready from past 30 mins. I don't understand where should the customer go if the delivery guy is not picking our calls.  Swiggy, where the company is using the$1 Billion raised investment? why not have a dedicated support phone line.  That's such a shame. Close down or sell the company for better people to run."
I have ordered some food from SWIGGY yesterday at around 12:40 PM . My order no was #52125188107. and while checking at 13:30 it says that will take more 78 mins. Where I have to cancelled my order because I was getting late for my work. But I was surprise when I have chat yesterday with one of the Swiggy colleague. he/she mentioned me that it will take time to refund as this is the procedure. I truly understand the policy and procedure. But as a courtesy you people should take even care of your customer who have skipped his lunch because of you guys.  SWIGGY have some suggestion:(GIVE LESS AND GIVE GOOD) Should not take much restaurant collaboration as it impacts your name in the market.
"If I get chance, I will slap all people working there in support.. Hell.just hell.. never ever use this bluddy app"
"I given order through swiggy, but I am not getting food, I also.mantion my address.proparly but swiggy delivery boy reach other place thn my order cancelled automatically, after that we received massage from swiggy side, your refund amount 50 % and my 50% cancle.  This is not good for customers services so much pathetically. I need refund full amount."
"Well where should I start from?? I'm not just  Disappointed but I'm extremely mad at them. I ordered food after a tiring day and I was starving. Took more than and hour and waiting game got me to sleep. When I woke up I see no calls but a texting saying order dilevered enjoy your meal. I called the dilevery guy and he rejected my call not once but several times. Then I went to the chat and spoke with an executive and as usual the answer was sorry for the inconvenience... Forget about that but that person lied to me saying we are not able to contact the dilivery guy where as he number was perfectly ringing and he was rejecting my call and few atimes it says on another call. I asked for a refund and he said you will get back the money in 4-7 days... So for almost a week I get neither food nor my money back. What policy is that swiggy??? When I asked he replied it's a bank intiated process that is why ..lol when we pay ist that bank initiated ... We don't pay online through clouds saying you will get the money within a week. Okay even ignore that, later the dilivery guy called me and I m thinking it was by mistake but when I told him what trouble he caused me he replied saying .. mujhe nahi Lana that waha isleye Maine nahi laya ?????? that was his words ..... And I again complained but the answer was the same ?? sorry for the inconvenience. Ghanta sorry! Don't even deserve one star... But one star is for those few who work sincerely"
"I ordered a veg whopper  Got a stale bun, 2 cabbage leaves, no tomato. They put the ketchup on the cutlet!!!  This made the whole damn thing soggy by the time it arrived.  No tomatoes, no cheese and they call this a WHOPPER.  Cost- 250  This is the first and last time i ordered with both swiggy and burger king.  I'm done with both."
The experience was great.the ordering was simple and the timing was exact.we can even track the delivery person
They will just kill you craving not by providing the food but delaying it or canceling it and after 1 hr later you will begging your amount refund to account but they will give you a coupon.
Today I had ordered on chicken tikka roll Order No(#51724892892) from swiggy that was sent by Tibb's Frankie.  The roll was very cold & totally tasteless there was no chicken only onions was there.  Then I ordered Hot Chocolate Fudge from Giani's(Order No: #51731126626) for Rs 200/- but the portion was so small. that it was not worth of Rs. 50/- only.  what I think is that through SWIGGY the vendors don't supply the quality food.  What I will suggest you friends that don't don't order through SWIGGY instead kindly order directly through the vendor.
"Nobody has a clue in the whole company about anything.  Its all about there valuation and revenue  If you ask a simple thing from 10 people, they all have there versions  The way the calculate there commission to merchants, selling discount as a product and charging taxes's on top is nothing but a shameful act.  Yes they do generate business for merchants, but they are not bothered about small merchants.  Its not ""SWIGGY"" ITS ""SHITTY"""
Have order food one hour before but cancelled order for some unwanted reason and delivery guy was talking rudely and not responding calls at all
"They order half items of the delivery that they're supposed to. When I called the customer executive, they offer to refund me partial amount but what do I do with it when I don't get to eat whatever I have ordered."
"ITS REALLY SHOCKING TO EXPERIENCE WITH SWIGGY THAT THEY ARE SENDING BOYS FOR DELIVERY WHO ARE TALKING LIKE THESE... READ...  BOL BE TERA LOCATION  MERE ANDHAR DIKHTAIJ NAHI  TEREKO ORDER CHAHIYE TO LEKE JAA  MAIN IDHAR KHADELA HU  CHAHIYE TO BOL...

"I ordered something, order was not delivered, when I complained their response was delivery executive is saying he has delivered they cannot do anything. I am not using swiggy again in my life. I advise other people to do the same"
They dont care about the customer money and provide us with their shitty product and on complaining they just say ill convey it to the restraunt
"From Nerul Subway.  Suraj: Executive who made the subway.  Azhar Manager  Delivery Agent: Ankit Gupta  The order had missing item: No Chicken Kofta Wrap  The other item which is below was made wrong, it had capsicum and made in the least interested way wherein even the kofta was not sliced and just made into whatever mess and sent across.  We waited for the order for like 45 mins and we expected the order to be atleast the subway standard. With such kind of professionalism and compromise on food standards a brand like subway does not stand up to its healthy eating and food promise.such a pity.Placing a strong review for the outlet as well.  I know the least you can mange ia a refund but this is extremely pathetic that even the rider could not counter check the order received and blindly picked up whatever was handed to him. Shrugging responsibilities has become a fashion when it comes to food delivery and Swiggy."
Swiggy service is very bad  When I'll give online order after few minutes shope kipper call me and conform my order and saying after 40 min order will be rich in your place but after 80 min when i call than hi say after 20 min and finally his cancele my order than I'll call again why you cancele my order his saying me now shop is close.what is this I'll giving my order ditele....51200442362
"I had ordered an Jumbo Nachos Vada Pav which had an offer of buy one get one free. So in that case I should have got 2 Burger Vadas but the restaurant owners didn't only cook the other one properly. One of the Burger Vada was less in quality, Different in taste and low in quality. When I massaged their customer service platform, firstly they replied late, then they also didn't provide me with any compensation. So very poor service!"
"Wish I could give 0 star. I placed prepaid order of Rs.121 at around 10pm. Got a call from delivery boy around 10.20pm to confirm the delivery location which I did. After 15-20mins again I got call from Swiggy saying that delivery boy is denying to deliver the order because of wrong GPS location(I can't do anything for this, even I updated the complete address manually) and they are trying to convince the delivery boy to deliver the order. Again I got call after 15mins saying that they are cancelling the order. 1st thing that I didn't get food but got the cancellation message from swiggy after 1hour and also I got charged Rs.60 as cancellation fee. Tried to connect with customer executive which was again unexpected, they were not ready to listen my prob n closed the tickets 3-4 times without solution. Wow, what a great service !"
"WOW! an order of 278 was made by mistake and I messaged CC immediately like 2-3 mins to cancel the order and they say cancellation fee of 128rs will be applicable, what? order was not confirmed by restaurant yet and you guys say 128rs of cancellation charge? wow that's almost 50% of the amount that ordered from. are you even kidding me? I am never looking back at swiggy, there are way better delivery services that this, its complete SCAM! how can they charge 128rs for mere 270rs order? just ridiculous"
"Couple of times accept payment and order and then after 40 mins you will get a call from delivery boy that he spilled the food, so u have to cancel or reorder.  again couple more times order accepted and payment and then the delivery boy will call and say items not available in the restaurant:(  too many confusion and fighting to just get food delivered. stopped being super member as well"
Amazing service by swiggy for the second time especially from the escalation team name muralidhar nayak. it's the second time I had a rough time on my order but the credit to this person name muralidhar not every one can accept the mistakes and give resolution but he did. extraordinary work.  Thank you for your service.:)
"Am Order Two Items, Name death by chocolate in lessi shop but I received one Item am oder two items, Then issue rise to Swiggy but swiggy side He is telling just Sorry apologies sending Message why sorry? Where's my item and Money? Am talking but he is sorry only then closed msg box why Next Time Am not oder to swiggy very worst not respons to customers Dot"
These days Swiggy delivery is getting poor. I have ordered around 8.30 it's 9.30 and more but no updates on app or from delivery boy for order. App showing food is being prepared but delivery boy is saying his bike has broken down and other guy will deliver it. After 10 mins I called back him but he is still waiting for other guy but app still shows 'Food is being prepared'.. I have no choice other than cancel.its now around 10 in night and other vendors near by were closed. Now who will have the responsibility for food which I was waiting...if they guy can't do it why fake it? Why don't they add some buffer time if they are not sure. This is pathetic service unexpected from an experienced chap. And even at the time of cancellation they were not concerned at all..I'll prefer to use Zomato next time.
"We had ordered Mcallu ticky meal from the McDonalds using Swiggy app but the order was never delivered wherein it showed us that the oder was delivered. You can say that the executive ate it. Also the swiggy has kept the delivery executive who was not at professional and just gave us stupid reasons stating that order nuber miss place.Now the customer service of swiggy is sitting just to waste their time and our time . they cant give a proper resolution, gave us miscommitment and still there 24hrs is not completed as we had called yesterday at around 12pm. we were suppose to get refund but we are still waiting for the same.  The delivery boy of my order just ate it. And not  So I would suggest you not to use Swiggy who has the worst customer service and delivery boys"
"We had ordered Modaks from the Tiffin story using Swiggy app but the order was never delivered wherein it showed us that the oder was delivered. You can say that the executive ate it. Also the swiggy has kept the delivery executive who was not at professional and just gave us stupid reasons stating that ""He cant come to my locality as he had met with an accident eariler"" Are we suppose to see that also? Then why have you kept him as a execctive. Now the customer service of swiggy is sitting just to waste their time and our time . they cant give a proper resolution, gave us miscommitment and still there 24hrs is not completed as we had called yesterday at around 12pm. we were suppose to get refund but we are still waiting for the same  The delivery boy of my order just ate it.

I order online swiggy food lot of time and I think it is one of the best online food.
Not satisfied reducules cheating company nonsense reply and irritating iam very much hurted Down to earth
Terrible experience. Never pay before delivery of order. I paid in advance and the food was delivered very late and the there was nobody to talk to
They are not available to talk to us..my refund is pending without order id..as it said portal down...now they are cooking up crap and no t refunding the rightful amount they swallowed
Worst service ever seen!!they cancelled my order because of their own technical issues and charged me cancellation fee.i could show them the proof of technical issues still no support from there side.
Swiggy is worst in Services and infact doing online frauds now.  They are damm frauds. They himself cancel the order and charge cancellation from Customer. Already sent mail and chat but no use.  Zomato is better in services…
"I had placed my order on 28 August at 6 pm and the order was not even confirmed I called dominos they were like if haven’t received any orders from swiggy and I have done the payment online I tried contacting their executives none is responding. The order was not even confirmed nor delivered. Now they are asking me to contact dominos directly where in I have ordered on swiggy Nd have paid to them. The executive named bibhas is the worst executive he wasn’t even replying for 20 times I was waiting for he’s reply Nd he closed the chat not only him bt the other executives as well ( Janardhan S, Bharathkumar BK, Subhranil, Bidnit ) this are worst executives they were not even letting me reply Nd closing the conversations. Till now ( 1st Sep ) the order has not being confirmed it’s showing on my swiggy profile Nd none is responding well."
"I don't know what is the standard time of delivery of any order, for 2 ice cream from last 2 hours I'm waiting and still I didn't get my order...  And when I'm trying to chat with someone they closed the conversation without resolving the issue. How can someone do this."
"While placing order(subway) which takes hardly couple of minutes to prepare and which is hardly 2km away from my home it showed ~30 min. I was OK with it. I got the sandwich after 1.5hrs and the sandwich was dead cold. For most of the time, after I placed the order the status was showing as 'Food is being prepared'. This is absolutely false information. Subway sandwich doesn't take more than 5 min to prepare.  I would have liked if you were honest in saying that it would take more than 40min to deliver your food instead of showing wrong information.  Assuming they were still preparing the sandwich (since 1hr) and assuming it takes 15 min to reach at my house from the restaurant, the sandwich should have been at least Luke warm(at least this is how i had received on previous occasions same food at same location).  On the same day while chatting with their rep on some information needed on my previous orders the service representative was replying to my every ping after 5min. Such horrible service.  Be honest guys...else you know what will happen to you guys if this is the case with every other person.  I guess this was my last order from swiggy.  Ciao..."
Very poor service. Took 1 hour after pick up to deliver. Bad behaviour. Was not able to locate the address even after guiding via phone. Did not pay need to how I directed to my address. I got to the road to help them deliver to me. Then the guy doubted if I am the person who was supposed to get it and misbehaved.
While placing my order for dominos via swiggy I was showed a discount of rupees 100 and later when the delivery arrived there was no discount. The chat executive first said they don’t deal with issues related to domino’s and later said that Coupons are not applicable on COD. Why was I not notified in either case? Had a real bad experience. being a student it just made a hole in my pocket
"Swiggy in PUNE is the WORST.  lack of basic DECENCY.  The delivery guys are ruthless, rude and scammers and  NEVER deliver parcel on time.  VERY RISKY for WOMEN to order food in the night.  In my case the delivery guy had picked up the parcel from restaurant and wasn't delivered for more than 2 hours. Got frustated and had to fight to cancel the order with the restaurant owner. The delivery guy never answered the phone as well.  I would suggest never order food from swiggy as delivery boys are scammers. food is never delivered on time. bad experience everytime . instead try Zomato or uber eats"
Please dont order any swiggy food because they or not worth i told them to wait for 20 more mins but he was very roufh to me so i started blasting me as well but please dont you ever order on swiggy never order with swiggy zomoto is better then so called swiggy so called swiggy is asking 3stars tat mens they are chitiyas
Delivered smelly and bad food and refused to refund.d delivery boy also updated false delivery.very very bad experience
"Twice I tried ordering! Twice I got cheated!! They had given coupon code, which they accepted, later on in payment section it was showing original amount without discount in all the payment options!!"
Very bad service..... Disappointed a Lott.  Adress was correct but location set was showing incorrect delivery boy denied for the delivery. Instead of saying no for cancellation swiggy people cancelled my two order n took charges of Rs. 39 each for two order. I m in loss of 80rs plus no food. This people cheats the customer n earn money how long vl u service by cheating n earning. Vl request people not to order online by swiggy. Com
"I ordered my food in delhi. By mistake i put my home delivery address. When i review my order after placing it, i changes my address to railway station. Lastly the delivery distance was about 7 kms and charges 113, while after changing the address it is only 3 kms to deliver food and charges increased to 133+20 INR extra to deliveryboy for raiway platform ticket and bike parking."
The purpose of swiggy is to deliver the restaurant food at home but not to deliver it as fast as possible. Please stick to the moto and help avoid accidents as we see many startup ending with such heavy cost. The actual purpose is well served.:) All the best!
I Use Swiggy food Delivery Mobile Application. It use GPS Technic and Shows you nearby restaurant that registered with Swiggy. I often order food from Swiggy and it do live track for you. Swiggy Delivery boy deliver food within 30 to 35 minutes. It is useful mobile application. Swiggy also provide good discount to order food.
Delevered rotten food and even providing replacement.  Chat person denied for help  When asked for refund or replacement shunak denied for help
"BE CAREFUL.If you face any problems with your delivered items, they will provide you compensation only till a few no. of times(CHECK THE ATTACHED PICTURES) ( compensation is usually coupons worth Rs 30/50/75, refund only if customer has bought order of low cost bill ).After a period of time, if you complain even with a very serious problem ( insects in your food etc, ) the customer executives will openly say that ""we can only compensate for a limited no of complaints, even if it is very serious, we will not address the issue as the system limit is over. You can directly talk to the restaurant , as it is not responsibility of SWIGGY. This happened to me during my 6th complaint in 9 months of regularly using swiggy. The previous complaints were regarding burnt food, late delivery after two hours etc. I even sent them pictures/ video of the insects in the food, through chat, email, their social media pages. But no response.Restaurant owner said that SWIGGY takes responsibility for orders done through their app."
These guys are cheater. Don't order from these People. We never get order what we order. It's one of the worst application.
"Swiggy is such a good idea to serve hunger people.but these is a problem with maintenance and negligence. restaurants and swiggy guys is not caring about customer and their requirement but they will deduct money. when I was in chennai I orderd KFC, but the KFC guy said no order delivery option for today but from swiggy guy I got message received your order on the way to delivery, they dint deliver after an hour also.but they deducted money.like twice happende the same day after refunded 3 days later.  another example I order food insted of one time, orderd the twice I tried to cancel that with in two minutes but for that cancellation they took total price of that order."
"Dear swiggy,  Your outlets at lakhimpur kheri is not good.Within 3 days I have used yours two outlets.There is no taste totally wastage of money.Kindly find the better outlets at lakhimpur because swiggy is a brand name which as used at Delhi, Ambala, Lucknow and Kanpur."
I have made a order through app .delivery executive doesn't even truned up and these guys have deduct 351 for cancellation ...there is fault of mine..guys alteast check with your exe
"Worst service ever, they do not deliver food on time. Infact at times they mk excuses that some one stole food or some internal issues are going on, i waited until an hour and my order was cancelled as some1 stole it was the reason given to me"
Worst service ever.....very very bad...Everytime they have problem...my suggestion is don't order from seiggy if u r damn hungry...we can't trust u ..worst worst.....management is not at all good....
A very bad response from the customer support when I asked about my order and for the all knowledge of every one I had placed an order which has been preparing from past 1 hour and two delivery executive has been changed till now I have not received my order and seriously if I have to wait for more than 1+ hour so I think I should visit nearby place and eat or either order from other platforms it was my duty to inform all user the worst class service they provide in swiggy.
"Ordered food at 8.13 pm on 23Aug19.  It is 11:58 now. Still waiting for food to be delivered.  Restaurant is saying swiggy guy picked up food.  Swiggy guy's phone switched off.  Swiggy customer service executive, unable to help.  Assigned another guy to pick up food. He's also not able to deliver.  Swiggy supervisor contacted. Phone disconnected and no return call.  Is Swiggy going in Loss, so taking money from customers and not delivering???"
Waaoa. What a great food quality provided by swiggy. Really tasty and genuine. I have ordered the pizza from swiggy. Very least time in delivery and very polite services . Really I like their services
"Hello,  I installed Swiggy App after watching lots of Adds about it on Tv Channels and Youtube. I thought finally some excellent services are starting in India. But it wasn't Like that.  I was in Allahabad, summer breaks were started in my college so Hostel Mess was closed too. So I decided to Order Food from Swiggy And I opened Swiggy App and took a look at the menu from various popular Restaurants and added tried to add few items to cart but I wasn't able to add any items to the card, I thought because app isn't update that is why this all is happening. I updated Swiggy but still problem wasn't solved so I asked my friend to order from swiggy and he was facing the same problem. I was so hungry and this app wasn't working I really got frustated by this issue. So after that I had to order food from different app. And from that day I haven't used swiggy till now. And I won't.  Thank You."
"Swiggy person delivered our order to someone else & that is also without informing us & refused to provide any compensation for it. Very bad very bad hopeless, rude. They deserved less than one star."
After wasting your time they will mark order as delivered but you will never get your order. stay away from swiggy.
"There is no rating less than 1, otherwise I would have given them that. Very bad. Very very bad. Believe me."
Very bad service please if u cant handle shut it down dont give trouble to others cutomer support is also not helpfull I called them to complaint but no fullfilling response they said will keep on hold for a moment and didnt turn back 20 minutes the call was on hold I disconnected the call as I was in the office also they deducted the money as compensation for placing the order
After ordering and waiting for 25 mins they call and say your order is not placed and will ask to reorder and wait again. You will be keep waiting and they will just ask you to reorder. This seems like they have confidence of more customers. I think it’s left to people t
Swiggy is very good food service.we can order it at hotel or hostel if we are living alone so we dont have to cook and also its have good offers on food.its very good in rains or u dont want to go outside for lunch or dinner
Firstly it detects wrong location. And secondly when we enter the address it locates wrong address after we mentioned. This distract the delivery boy and call and keeps on asking the address.  First Develop you site and then start working from it.  Order No - 48423320724
"Firstly I installed the app thinking that's it's trustworthy and it's service is quick but I was very dissappoint with what happened today. I placed an order of chicken keema biryani but they failed to deliver the order physically and without calling me , they simply sent a mail mentioning that my order is delivered which doesn't make sense at all. This carelessness is totally not acceptable at all and I'm requesting the concern team to take care of these issues so that it won't repeat again. Small issues like this do leads to a major cause if it's not taking care of."
"On 8th August ordered 2double egg mutton roll from Aminia for my family.When I came back on asking I came to Know that it was delivered double chicken roll. I was shocked, wanted to complain, but couldn't get any option as they asked for photos as proof. How ridiculous? Customer care doesn't pick up the phone. How customers are cheated."
Delivery boy used wrong language while giving me food packet. He told it was difficult for him to locate my house and I should not order from swiggy. Worst & horrible experience.. Will think twice to order from swiggy onwards..  Order No. 48347878587.
"I have placed my order on 7/8/2019 at 7:44 PM. After 10 minutes of placing the order, I received a call from delivery guy who picked my order. He said that there are some technical issue with Swiggy app and he is not able to see the order on his side and requested to cancel the order. I asked the guy if there is technical error then how he is able to pick my order and also got my phone number and called me. However, he insisted to cancel the order and said that he will not be able to deliver food until I cancel and re-order. I have canceled the order and was charged a cancellation fee of 200 Rs. While I was on the call, I asked the guy to stay there and I will re-order the food. The delivery guy hung up the call saying Hello.Hello.Hello and cut.  I called customer care number but of no use.  I was very disappointed about this as how I was made bakara. Later, when I went to the hotel directly to hotel to buy the food, I met with another Swiggy guy who informed me that this is what going in Swiggy where delivery guys first marks customer not responding in their app and then do this kind of things to cancel the order after which they enjoy customer food."
"Order [No 48136552179 Rs 879, 06/08/19, morning] sweets from Balaram Mallik. Charged Rs 200 over the cost. [Rs 679] . Showed order on the way Suddenly cancelled order, Guests waiting at home! Customer service claimed'Could not be contacted during delivery: Clearly, no need to, payment was made, address was checked, I had no in coming call any way., on my phone.  Customer service [Sara] will refund only Rs 679, 00, replied ""Rs 20 is charged for efforts to prepare the food and deliver"" despite no delivery, suddenly order cancelled from their end despite my full payment, of Rs 200 over the price of the sweets!  Terrible experience!"
I had ordered chicken wings from KFC through Swiggy on 28th July afternoon and the amount got deducted twice from my account. As I raise the payment issue in chat they told me to wait for 7 days. After 7 days the chat was response by the above mentioned person and he insist on writing that the payment was captured only once. I shared him details of the double transaction but he keep denying and closed the chat again and again without responding. This is how his way of solving queries
We ordered 3 subs and after payment it said our order wasn’t placed. We had to call the bank and swiggy over and over to get it cleared.
"I have used almost every food Ordering app when I moved to other city from my hometown and my experience is worst in every app and swiggy one of them.  One day I think I was so unlucky eventually I skipped lunch and continue doing my work and at around 9pm I reached my room I was tired so I order food from swiggy and I have done payment around 250rs the estimate time of delivery was 10pm but time being time time getting increased like 10.10, 10.30 , then I called to swiggy delivery boy they told me that his vehicle punchured and there is some delay I told him ok and waited around 30 mins and again called him but he didn't pick my calls so I reached to swiggy customer care they told me wait to another 15 min if delivery not done they will assign to other rider. I waited but no result. Calla and followup takes 12am and now my hunger get killed by them.  Customer care spoc tell me at 12 that ""Sorry sir ab delivery nahi ho payegi koi dikkat hain hum apke paise refund kar rahe hain""now tell me at midnight they told me that they can't deliver my food and refund my amount, this time I cannot order food from other sources and finally I slept without food."
I am sharing my personal openion that's I order aloo paratha from swiggy and they provide me onion paratha and they never be on time so guys I suggest you before going for swiggy make sure and check everything before ordering.
You are not provide good services. Everytime I order somthing I face problems and even the delivery boys delivered the food always after 1 hour and whenever I ask for replacement and for refund you always denied
I ordered my food from restaurant good for one in Mohali. The food was pathetic and stale. I simply wasted my hard-earned money.  @good4one @goodforone pls don't fool customers.
Swiggy.com done my work easy best food delivery app. Swiggy is fast deliverd and fresh food delivered. When you eat testy food then order on swiggy.
My order food not receive they say we delivered what is this company no one can do anything with this people there like ma fiya.
Simple one world for their great service and customer support and business model.  (Madarchod bhosadike)  Their customer support have no idea what they are doing on call saying something else and after that doing some thing else please hire some educated employees or give them proper training.  Randwa company apni gad me ghoma ke dal apna.
It is a disappointing fact that they can’t handle this business. I ordered food. First they confirmed then last min they have cancelled it. This is not the first time they are doing this. Had such experience before. To top it all once they gave me wrong order.  My sincere advice to Swiggy is quit this because they can’t handle the business.  I will make it a point to advice all my friends never to order from swiggy.
Un install the app and teach SWIGGY to grow and prosper mutually  U tube link https://youtu.be/PJl3ZWLS5Xs  Treating employees - delivery guys  Unprofessional work culture with ppl who are the roots of the company  Please support the delivery guys of Faridabad who are on crisis as company announced deduction in per order pay as well as incentives and MGP  Disaster this was my last order through you guys shifting to zomato or Uber good luck swiggy
They them self cancel order and they ask for cancelation charge worst services simply waste of my time
I have ordered breakfast and have payed for it but after Wyting half an hour the delivery executive Called and told order cancelled the restaurant is not have this item .custom care contact me and told will refund the Amount  after 5 working days. Is it the right way???
Worst service ever! waited for 2.5 hours and still food was not delivered . absolutely useless customer service. this company should close down
"I ordered food through swiggy from A2B Marathalli. They gave sambar which gone bad and stinking. I contacted Swiggy for resolution in return they are giving 50rs on next order. I have attached photos of how bad the food was. But still no resolution. Some automated bot chat was kept on saying ""we regret the inconvenience"" without any resolution"
I installed swiggy after my friend recommended to install it 6 months ago  And I never regret that decision  The concept is quite unique of online food delivery. Especially at cheaper price  The app has variety of restaurants listed from normal to top notch restaurant  And a vide variety of crusines are available to order from  The app ui is simple an user-friendly.  And it's very easy to find dishes or restaurants  I ordered several times biryani and pav bhaji chicken Butter masala  And other dishes  The food are delivered hot and fresh  And also in proper time. And the charge of delivery is quite reasonable and even they have prime package for free delivery.  Something the food delivered is not upto mark and so the customer care is always there for help and quite good at resolving issues.  In any defect they offer replacement of food item and also they provide money in the form of coupon if food quality is not upto the mark  Thus swiggy is totally reliable  And offers fresh food in cheap cost.  The app has variety of coupons available  And they also email special coupons to their valuable customers  Thus you can order from swiggy without any hesitation.  And it is totally value of money so start ordering
Last 3 day am having problem due to swiggy food delivery.first day when i order food i have wait one hour and after that they deny to deliver because rider not getting enough pay second day also i order that time driver came from wrong way when i so him tha way he said now he is not going to deliver because he have drive 2 km more now and today when i order thay not response in customer service and not behaving well always don't care if u wait for your order more then 1 hours 35mint
"Had a worst experience .. delivery executives don’t even wait for two minutes and cancell the order result we hav to pay unnecessarily cancellation fee.. often there delivery executives face one another problems, customer support staff is unable to resolve any issues.."
"The worst app, the worst customer support & the worst service.  I had issues with my food delivery as it was more than 2 hours and the customer support doesn’t even bother to help you out. They just randomly empathise with you through out the conversation and shuts you down. Then they ask you to cancel the order. I doubt if they really send the money back.  It has happened numerous times with me and I am sure I will not order from this app again. My last meal will be from the pizza place, Koramangala."
"Order ID 47116788668  Ordered food around 1 noon, delivery time was 46minutes. I got call from executive after half an hour asking how would you like to pay, I said it’s prepaid. Then I got update on app saying food will be delayed due to heavy rain in your area, it was not raining at all. Then I get a call from swiggy at 3 after 2 hours saying your order is cancelled as some other delivery boy picked your food. After having long discussion, swiggy team said they will place order again which will again take 40 minutes. Swiggy has the worst customer relationship service. Didn’t get proper response and solution from executive other than the refund. You should provide something extra to keep customer happy and to transact again. Highly dissatisfied. Apply the policy to retain your unhappy customer.  #swiggy #swiggyworstserviceprovider #swiggyworstdelivery #swiggyindia #swiggysuper #swiggydissatisfiedcustomer #swiggydelivery"
"Instead of solving their customer queries, the executives sitting beside encourages to cut the call .Doesnt even know customer service call etiquette."
I have order at 10:40 and after an hour it shows me that order is delivery which was not. When i called swiggy the agent told me that delivery executive has given the order to some one else by mistake which was a big frustration for me who made my sunday dinner with nothing.i paid rs207 and swiggy representative was saying that we can give you the voucher of rs200...i was laughing and he disconnected the call......please shut down swiggy...i am also doing the legal case.....
"The mannerless discussions, all the bullshit unprofessional delivery boys.  All nonsense service with stupid advices from Swiggy officials.  #Just avoid ordering from it if you are wise decision maker."
"I have been using Swiggy for quite some time and it was good initially but for last few months the service is very bad. I have faced many issues like.. Item not delivered but got refund, its not about money, my kids gone hunger because of that... Had to go hunger for multiple hours... And pathetic situation is Swiggy didn't take any responsibility..  Now a days the orders are delivered with lower quality and quantity because of discount... Very bad service."
"My experience says that their food packings are usually tempered..and it is difficult to assume that food being sent is untouched or unused..and while making complaints, u hv to handle highly discourteous customer ""care"" (?) rogues..just useless..I doubt that they maintain any reaonable standards.."
I have ordered Veg Crispy from GAURI FAMILY RESTAURANT they provided me with very bad quality and burning food so I just have one bite that food next time I haven't have it. whole food has been wested and has to put it in the dustbin. This Restaurant is very bad and also their food is so cheap. I do not like
I had ordered the following order from loghouse hotel at kothrud.

No reponse from customer care im total unhappy with your bad service im going to stop order in swiggy waste employees no response from ur company for late delivery also i tryied to call customer care no responding i don't get option to cancel my order stupid service
"""Swiggy doesn't take responsibility for packaging quality of the vendor or restaurant who packs it "".  These are the words of pan india validation manager who spoke to me said when I complained that whole of the order was spilled when ordered from Starbucks. Out of 5 drinks ordered only one was delivered in a good condition. These people dont care if the customer is satisfied or not with delivery. When I complained regarding the same they say they are helpless and they say it cant be validated with the images shared by me. Even the delivery executive was aware of all this. As a result customer is at loss for ordering in swiggy and spillage.  Totally non friendly customer service ."
"I seriously do not understand why you guys are running this when customer is not happy. Every Time I need to chat with you representative to receive my order. I am wasting my time, money and effort . Fk off."
"I ordered from Hyderabadi Biryani restaurant. I checked the restaurant menu, it was at least Rs 20-30 less tan swiggy prices. Uber eat was even less than the restaurant prices.  I ended up paying Rs 300 more for an order worth 900.  I will never order through swiggy, unless they refund my entire order(Order #45586254215)"
"I always feel SWIGGY has become one amoung the most trusted portal, Even though I had faced an issue few days before with an order cancelation at late hours by SWIGGY, Due to which fllowing things happend . 1) order was placed for dinner for my Kid and wife at 8.11 pm, Since dinner is ordered my we took a break from kitchen, Finaly a call comes from swiggy stating sorry for the delay order will be delivered in 10 minute, My kid got ready with the paltes and at 9.40 we get an sms saying order got canceld .We had to rush to near by restaurent, Since dinner was ordered I personly had gone for 2 pegs now driving beacme a full? later wat we lost is following .  1) CAB expencess up & Down  2) My kids next days class since we reached back it was 11.40  First time we faced this and to those people who did could had called & appoligized us next day which was lagging from your side, Just due to one or two resturents or peopls SWIGGY brand should never be affected .  Order Number: #47054496681  We love SWIGGY Since the smile come in door steps has got it value ."
One day we have decided to order 4 pizzas from swigggy at night so its final to order pizza so therefore we had not made food at home and we are waiting for pizza . They told that pizza is coming in 1 or 2 hours because swiggy is at 2 or 3 km away from our home. But pizza not comed and its to late there fore we sleep at night and we are so hungry.  And in morning pizza camed at to late we are so angry at delivery man and we returned pizza because its camed to late and thats same night we go to the hotel at dinner and ate pizzza its good.  But we are very angry because pizza camed to late and from that day we never ordered pizza from swiggy till today. I really didnt liked it.  Thankyou
"We received one of the worst packets of 2 pizzas, most probably they were dropped on the way, with all the toppings on the lid.  On trying to reach the ‘help’ of Swiggy, we are only told a ‘sorry, but we can’t help, our systems don’t allow us to compensate’  Having already spoilt our evening dinner, the least we expected was our money back. The most pathetic service and help that I have experienced for online platforms.  Nobody should ever order from Swiggy!"
Their poor management wasted 4 hours of mine. Worst management. Ever. Kept asking me to pay cash on delivery even after online payment. Executives do not understand our problems and keep giving stupid solutions.
"When I was a pregnant has lot of cravings to have variety foods, since I am a working women, I was not a position to cook myself. thats when SWIGGY was with me and I used to order anything I feel like eating and swiggy used to deliver fresh and delicious food and making me and my baby inside me Happy:-) Hence we call her by nick name SWIGGY .  THANK YOU SWIGGY FOR MAKING A PREGNANT WOMEN TUMMY HAPPY. SWIGGY TIME HAPPY TIME"
I ordered Domino's pizza from swiggy and paid it through my debit card but it was a pathetic service from swiggy and Domino's they did not delivered my food and it was marked delivered but I was continuesly trying to contact swiggy regarding this but they are saying we are only order placing company you need to talk to Domino's but when I ask what about the payment which I have made to Domino's they didn't giving any answer and just closed the call happened 5 or 6 time what is this I am not able to understand for this I will give negative rating to swiggy and Domino's
"This company is good now days this is becoming so popular because its starting small cities also.you can order from it to your home, office, etc.you can order anything you want to have.i like this app so much.i hope this will help someone to understand."
I use swiggi regularly... I have faced small problems but I haven't made any issues.. today I have noticed that bill cost is high.. I was ordered 2 item it's total cost is 179 but it 210 then take offers which again remains the same amount ... They using attracting offers to get customers.. truth is slowly redusing offers and increasing in bill amount..
Pathetic service food delivered was bad in taste and was smelling badly. And they even denied for compensations
We ordered food from Swiggy salim mughlai Ghaziabad worth 659 rs... The delivery boy did not come. Did not call... God knows and they just cancelled the order. Inspite of having address they did not ring a bell. And later on exhorbitant Cancelleation charges. Of 200 rs... The customer service person says sir i understand etc etc.. But that how they make and munch money.... Indoubt even if the order was made and sent.
Such poor customer support services. Food delivered was spilled all overand then customer service representatives didn’t address the issue and they kept on closing the help conversations.  Very disappointed!!the next time when I ordered from dominos at midnight 12 they kept me waiting about 1 hour and when I have other options to order they call said they can’t deliver.when I called swiggy they say dominos has their own delivery n we r not responsible n the most cheating thing is the ordered is shown delivered.my point is I ordered from swiggy n they should be responsible.
"I have ordered for 2 different dishes and after 49 Mints got one dish delivered tried to make compliant its was painful  Asked for replacement message comes 52 mints wait  Response of Nagaraju(CE) takes fairly long time wait for 10 mints  Do they care for customer? and why not a penality to applied on them  After sometime other person calls and says you location is showing wrong, while I have given complete address, what is fault of customer?, why should we undergo pain after paying delivery charges?  Need to improve"
"They take 2hrs to deliver your order(that too not sure if it will be delivered or not)  ""DO NOT TRUST THEM IF U ARE HUNGRY OR HAVING SOME IMPROTANT OCCASSION""  WORST WORST WORST!!!!!!  Last moment a customer gets irritated and cancels the order from there side,  Thats what they want!!  INDIA DOESNT NEED SUCH AN USELESS A"
"Recently, I had taken home delivery of Sorse Ilish and Rohu fish fry from the Restaurant The Bong Dine.  I was astonished with the authentic taste of the dishes. mouth watering.  Next time I ordered Mangso kasha, which was excellent.Suggest, a must try."
"This is about yesterday’s food order with Swiggy to Bowl Company. I place my order at 11.40 am, and it showed 45 mins.  At around 12.30 pm delivery executive calls me to ask can he bring the order via auto as it is a bulk order and cannot be carried on the bike. I agreed to pay the auto charges and also requested him to bring it before 1 pm. Waited until 12.45pm and on the swiggy app it showed 45 mins more, so he hasn’t moved from the restaurant. I try calling the delivery executive and he was like I am not bringing it, order is assigned to a different guy and this way it went to until the order was assigned to the 8th delivery boy who also says I will bring it in 10 mins and doesn’t budge from his place and showed 45 – 50 mins on the app  In the meantime while I was trying all means and ways to get the delivery boy to deliver the food at my office, I also connected with the swiggy customer care which has sooper pathetic bunch sitting there and doing nothing at all. I spoke with 3 different executives, all the 3 had same answers mam, the delivery boy will be at your place in 10 mins at 1:10 pm to be precise. This went on for until 1.30 pm after which I stopped receiving responses from the delivery boys and the customer care folks.  This is outright insensitive and extremely poor management. If the order cannot be delivered it should not be confirmed or advice in 5 to max 10 mins of it's being placed that it cannot be serviced, not after the delivery time has passed. This is not what a food delivery service is supposed to do, they are to deliver to satisfy people's hunger and not leave people hungry because of their inefficiencies. To top it all, swiggy customer service through online chat, the representative had no answer to my queries, instead simply kept me waiting.  An absolute disappointing & disastrous experience."
Swiggy customer support is pathetic. They do not reply for 5-7 minutes and suddently reply and disconnect the chat. They tells that no minimum order and yesterday when I placed an order then there was a delivery charge of INR 59 with order of INR 59.  I added cold coffe and paid INR 118 for the order and thy themself cancelled my order and deducted 50% price as well.
GOT plastic in the food ordered.I really think they get food from roadside stalls.Very unhyge  When contacted the customer care executive disconnects the chats.One of the pathetic services of all online food providing companies.Unistalled the same day.
Hello world I found mouthshut during my searches when I got to know its a rewiving site . Thanks I got a platform.  Then I thought to write a review about swiggy like apps . Why not indian government care about these online food app mushrooms.  During ramzan I first time ordered from swiggy. A full plate biryani from nearby resturent. Suddenly my son felt a sharp steel pin in his mouth and he vomited the pin spitted by him we got a sharpe pin . I contacted to customer care but got disconnected by them several times. We threw all the food and just waisted our time and money .  Thank God I wrote my heart so that others may get a lesson.
I m eagerly waiting to write a review especially on swiggy which is and will be a embarrasing online app that fools its customers. First priority in this app is just more and more profit and not even a less service to its customers it exploits every employee working for it for its own benefits it is a retard all over
"I am ravi giving bad review on Swiggy due to fraud made me today.i have ordered Kalmi chicken masala 2 plates bearing order number 46112902679...I have paid full amount..I have waited around 2 hours but still dint get order..after 2 hrs I have contacted customer service for delivery purposes they have told that food has been delivered..after that I had concall between customer service and delivery boy, the delivery boy is said that he has delivered food..Once enquiry made by customer service he concluded that the delivery boy dint delivered food and he lied.

I ordered food from swiggy and I got the food container half open. I called up swiggy customer care executive and they are ready to compromise the packaging and food quality as they were least bothered.  They did not provide any resolution for the concern I had raised.  I request all of you to strongly avoid swiggy service as there plenty other food delivery services available.
Delivery executive comes till outside your house to deliver food from a restaurant on the same road and cancels the order. Really do they hire people who can at least read???? Order cancellations are now a trend with swiggy. They don't even deserve a star for their pathetic services.
1) Ordered food from top rated And swiggy suggest restaurant Nawab Asia on July 8 the food was very oily and so bad quality that we had stomach upset.followed up with swiggy but never got a feedback of what they are investigating and how they are investigating  2) Ordered pizza from Domino's through swiggy on June 28th received pizza with mayonese raised complaint in both dominos and swiggy just received a complaint no but till date it is not resolved.  Some fake food provider fraud company  The customer care provides same copy paste and. swiggy is not replying to grevences and people are getting fake food unhygienic food they are earning from people's hard earned money at stake of their life. Their in no seriousness to deal with issue from their side
Very good customer service and prompt service. Offers were also available. Timely delivery. Overall experience is good.
Delivery is not on time from since the product has been excepted and thus the food is not on time ..
Swiggy in my rohtak hayana make a big stand now a days and its cover all over my restaurants in my city and also it's give us discount as well and their timing to deliver their order is now improving as bfore I'm living in delhi their timing and customer service is not interested and now I liked the way that they give us in rohtak
"I had ordered for kulfi from kulfiano Dwarka however I got a message order is delivered but I did not get any delivery, this is not the first time still we were giving it a benefit of doubt, when we called swiggy they were not able to help , it only lead to frustration and wait , please do not use any outlet that uses swiggy for delivery as it will lead to frustration and spending money and order not reaching and making unnecessary calls to customer care who don’t even care, very bad and cheap manpower deployed by swiggy , think ten times as the food u get might have gone thru many such people who are unhygienic and unethical who can do lot of things from order pick up to delivery."
Bad experience I ever had even though I paid. There is no option for rating the delivery and also the system doesn't show one.
I ordered veg manchurian and noodles through swiggy on 7july 2019 and it took more than half an hour to guide the delivery boy itself and when after all of that mind tiring instructions finally he delivered the food but the food received was not what we ordered. They delivered non vegeterian food( chicken soup & egg biryani) how the hell they can be so ignorant its not just about food and money it involves a matter of emotions and religion swiggy this was my worst experience i’m never gonna order again and i urge all the other people to make sure your food is same as you order.
"I ordered food on 07.07.2019 night through Swiggy. However, some items were missing and I returned the food items since the Swiggy delivery boy asked for full payment including for the missing items. But I got a call from Swiggy executive saying that since my order status is delivered, the order cannot be cancelled and items cannot be returned. He asked me to take back the items and in the alternative, the Swiggy Executive assured that he has ordered the items from other shop and it would be delivered in another 40 minutes and asked me to take the items already ordered and returned earlier. I again asked me whether I have to pay for the items to be delivered from the other shop and he told that it is not required.Hence, I got the items sent through the Swiggy and paid the entire amount by cash to the Swiggy delivery boy. After that, however, I did not get the missing items, which were supposed to be ordered by the Swiggy Executive from the other shop till 2300 hours. I could not contact Swiggy either phone or online chat. Even in the online chat when I complained about the non-receipt of items and asked for the refund, the chat was closed. The act of assuring and making me to pay the entire amount and non-delivery of the missing items amounts to cheating by the Swiggy executive. This is not the first time it is happening to me."
Delivery boy named Vicky was too rude to deliver the order and he took the order back....when we asked him to come up. He took the order back..and worst part is that when we complained about it the customer service didn't pay any heed to it
"We placed order for dominos through Swiggy . However, order was delivered incomplete. On complaining to Swiggy, the staff directly told to complain to Dominos and issue will be resolved by 24 hours. What is the use to get part order after wards."
It looks like swiggy is cancelling the order by itself to earn cancellation fee.  If they are not able to find address they say u had given wrong address
Don't ever order from old madras bites. If you don't want to waste your money and health.(fish finger)
"The expected time of delivery showed to be 8 pm. The impatient delivery man cancels the order at 7:50 pm, after trying my number perhaps once/twice. I pay the cancellation charges of 50% of order amount. Customer care apologizes. Wow! Never try swiggy. Zomato way better!"
"Hii I want to refund My aishwaryasingh23ment.

"Ur delivery boys dont understand english, neither theyknow hindi...wIn hitec city 75 % are from diff part of country..speaks only english or hindi...WHY DO U KEEP DELIVERY BOYS WHO DONT UNDERSTAMD NEITHER OF TWO LANGUAGES..

They not able to serve the customer after that when you complaint will only take it as feedback and refuse to return your money. Pathetic
To day I hv ordered thru swiggy.....delivery time was 54 minutes after 35 minutes they have canceled my order.
I had ordered the sub by using this app and got my food in worst condition. We called swiggy helpline for the solution and they behaved so unprofessional. I waited for food for 1 hr and got the burnt sandwich. The lady wafa in swiggy customer service should learn how to deal with d situation....  It's been second time I ordered through swiggy and both time I got the worst experience  Then we called directly to subway and replaced our order. Then what is the point of using swiggy .  I'll never recommend anyone to order from this stupid app.  Worst food app.....Shut your app if you don't know how to deal with d customers
Order number. I order food cod. After 1hour 30mints they cancelled food reason they don't have any change. Amit rana he said if we order cod then customer responsibility to keep change. Whereas I informed swiggy at order time I have 500rs. Order value 217. I need change.
"I had ordered waffle.The waffle was cold and also packaging was diffrent.I waited half hour.I had previously faced same issues, hence at the time of placing the order I had given instructions to avoid all of their mistakes in past and make the food edible when it comes at my door.The garlic bread I had ordered in past..I was forced to eat"
"Swiggy is entitled for 0/5 but since there is no option giving 1 star. I had ordered food thru Swiggy to this restaurant called Homely. When opened the parcel one of the item was missing and immediately informed them. But look at their response, it is so unprofessional and pathetic, they response stating Sorry and the issue along with issued closed."
I ordered from swiggy 2 times. One time delivery man said dat food is delivered but i fidnt get anything. Second time delivery man is not picking my phone . And one aunty picked n said wo to ji bhar apne dosto ke sath kaha hai.. Wat da hell is this.. Worst swiggy worst food.. From my side i will give 0 out of 100 . I hate it.. Plzz dont order from this.
"Alert..! FRAUD Site!  ""Quality of service is very very poor...!""  ""Customer Satisfaction is NILL""  Using this platform all the restaurants are selling Old stocks...!  Better go with other food ordering platforms like ????  ZOMATO, UBER EATS...etc  I have ordered sweets from a bakery and they are full of Fungi and bad quality!(order id:44872800506)  When i complained about this Their representatives are answering rudely!  I want to return these products....  Delivery also very late.!  FAKE SITE FAKE"
"We called for a biryani and cassata icecream from Hotel K Tree, Kolhapur via swiggy. Since we were on our way home from a long tiring day after outdoor travel, we expected quick and smooth delivery. After placing the order, we got a call from Swiggy customer care to replace an item that the restaurent does not have. When we called the restaurent directly to check, they said they had the item but by mistake have cancelled the order. So please place the order again. We thought the restaurent owner was trust worthy and so re-ordered. We lost the swiggy discount this time, and yet reordered in good faith. Later on, we got many calls from swiggy customercare and were misled that the order is cancelled but the restaurent guy said no it is not and we would get our delivery. He even promised us he will deliver our required food, and on his idea we replaced the cassata with vanilla icecream which was of same cost and placed an order for the third time. He assured us he would send cassata in the delivery. But to our surprise it was no same as he had promised, nor was the food hot and fresh. We were cheated even after being fully cooperative by the restaurent staff."
"Today I ordered for Mcveggie paneer meal and a McChicken meal from McDonald's via swiggy.. they gave me chicken nuggets, two chicken kebabs and a McMaharaja chicken burger with two cokes of which the delivery boy kept saying mam its open and half got splashed do u still want.. upon I saying yes he handed over.. I opened the bag and later realized it wasnt my order.. I had ordered at 6:40pm it showed me 30-40 minutes but arrived at 8:40pm.. I called swiggy and expressed my concern about the order to give me a gesture of goodwill they reordered for me with no extra charge.. the customer service representative said it will reach in 49 minutes that was at 8:45pm.. it reached at 10:30pm.. and to my gesture of Goodwill it was again 2 McChicken.. upon me calling the customer service frustrated Mr. Andrew francis could just apologize and say mam v give u a voucher of 500rps.. all I wanted was my burger not their sorry or apology.. #swiggy #sucksbigtime #chor #fullofidiotsrecruited #cantdifferentiatebetweenpaneerandchicken #poorcustomersatstake #andrewfrancis"
"I taking time to how upset and shameful swiggy made me.  11th of june ordered food at 2340hrs and paid I get email order is confirmed then at 0015 delivery boy calls tells restaurant is closed. Then cust support calls telling restaurant is closed nothing can be done.  However restaurant closed at 0030hrs this was confirmed by swiggy escalation team, they apologized and offered compensation, and asked to give another chance, compensation I have declined which was so cheap.  Then on 29th june ordered again paid online, guess what hotel is run out of stock. Then I went personally to restaurant and they were still serving the food I wanted so took take away.  such bad practices I have deactivated swiggy account. If ur other competitors are far far better than Swiggy."
"Hi yesterday I ordered food from Swiggy and made payment online,  The delivery boy called my and said he reached the location when searched then no one is there, after few minutes he didn't picked my call. When I complained about this to chat executive, he was saying he already delivered the order, such a layer,  This is his number- 8929990669  Name-Gaurav"
"Recently ordered to A2B using Swiggy App after 90mins of wait finally we were delivered with damaged parcel and out of 6 items ordered only 4 were delivered. I have returned and requested for refund. They agreed on 14.06.19 and now they site some technical glitches for not refunding. This is one of the worst occurrences for me with Swiggy, twice it happened to me in recent past. Never would advocate Swiggy to anyone!!"
"Worst service by swiggy. They mixup orders, sometimes some contents of order missing, many times after orrdering, they cancel stating delivery guy unable to reach nd they cut service charges of 180/- for cancellation... Now I am using zomato best delivery fast delivery nd reliable"
Today I ordered a plain briyani and chicken fried rice through Swiggy. They delivered me spoiled food. It was very cold and unappetizing.
I placed order for sweets and it got cancelled as the delivery person was not able to deliver. saying I cant come to location or not able to find your address. and then he cancelled the order . Even though it was not my fault.
"Ordered from McDonalds, Burger and Wraps  Only burgers got delivered.  Nobody fixing the issue, everyone passes the buck.  NEVER EVER, EVER EVER  Trust this company and their delivery people."
I placed order for sweets and it got cancelled as the delivery person was not able to deliver. saying I cant come to location and then he cancelled the order and swiggy charged me 50% of the order. Even though it was not my fault.
"It was pathetic that whenever I order food from swiggy, I would have a problem and when I raise a complaint, they do fake promises. In swiggy every time you speak to a different person on a single issue, you get different answers and different promises. Bluff masters at swiggy.  Downfall of swiggy begins."
I think it's the best food app for the lazy people who don't wanna cook much like me to. The delivery of swiggy is perfect they deliver the food on the exact given tym .The food quality is also good as well as the packaging too.
"Have ordered and after sometime it’s shown as food delivered but I don’t receive then login for help and the executive drop the conversation without conclusion and it’s twice happened the called to customer service then I could able to talk and explain the situation, but no use. So it’s always preferable to pay on delivery, these people are playing and it’s not first time"
"Today , we placed an order from a renowned restaurant thru swiggy. Food came well in time but when I opened the food box , the chicken was miserably stinking. We have been visiting that restaurant for years and know it's taste so well that we were sure that this food does not belong to that restaurant. It was the worst experience ever in terms of outside food. We have learnt our lesson that we should approach directly the restaurant instead of giving responsibility to these morons."
"Around 3:02pm I had placed an order with Hangout cakes & more.that was a pineapple 1kg cake which arrived at 3:27pm.when we opened the package we received a cake which was completely damaged and not re-presentable . So I clicked the picture of the cake and forwarded to the swiggy customer department. Where I spoke to MR. Somit he insured me that the cake would be replaced and gave me the following order no 44619433005 and it will be delivered in 34mins( chat was done at(3:47pm) as well as he tld me that its my call if I want to return the spoiled cake or keep it. Then I got a call from the delivery guy who handovered the call to the vendor. Vendor said that I can replace the half kg cake which costed 395. Where as I had placed as well as received 1kg cake amounted RS 765.I paid the delivery guy 770 which was completely paid through cash. Where as vendor refused to replace the 1kg cake only agreed to replace half kg coz it was the swiggy guys fault since in hangout menu 1kg option isnt available the swiggy guy paid him 395rs which was displaced in the swiggy app receipt.but delivered us 1kg cake and took entire 770rs also vendor as well as swiggy didn't provide us the receipt of the 1kg cake order. In between this a lady called me from 7227032839 number and was so arrogant, mannerless as well as illiterate to be in a customer service background and doesn't have any ethics how to handle upset and not-satisfied clients. She was forcing us to cancel the replacement order and later without are permission she cancelled our order and disconnected the line. So I called the customer service spoke to 3 people MAYANK, NEHA & Team leader Mr. NIKHIL so finally after having a long 2hr call the conclusion was no replacement and we will be provided their shitty coupons. Such brainless heads still think that after receiving a bad product, bad customer service we would still use their app.at the end its not about the money its about the time we wasted and the occasion was spoilt ."
I have dead worms in my food am customer from 2 years and I have very bad experience from swiggy many times I oder food my kinds and near they provide me good quality food.an
"My order: 44437655186  I ordered for my lunch for Rs.183/- Special thali Veg, on 24-06-2019. I waited for 74 minutes and still I did not get the order. I am a diabetic patient, and was told that order will reach by 25 minutes.  I got a call saying following reasons  1) Special thali is not available, when I said that the executive told me it is available, then the next lie came  2) the executive is not able to deliver the food, that too after 74 minutes.  3) I was told another executive has been sent.  4) I got a call that the executive met with an accident.  Looks like this Swiggy has all kinds of fraud staff. may be trained to tell lies to customer.  Very irresponsible and un-trust-able organisation. I also filling a PIL against them.  I have lost my money, well they said they will refund after 2 to 4 days. Who will pay for the interest, and why should I pay for the cheating Swiggy did.  Well, I did not get my lunch and none of the executive have responded properly.  I request the public, please do not go by the advertisements and get cheated.  Thanks  Santhosh"
"I wish I can give rating of less than 1 star, we ordered veg dishes they sent us non veg dishes, we called the boss and he did not respnd well and he was mean and rude, finally he said he can't do anything and also suggested us to call and give complain to swiggy. We received worst service both from swiggy and this resturant(Navayuga). Very worst service."
Pathetic service guys. Absolutely rude on the face.They travel wrong and then blame it on us and then bluntly say that cancel your order I will not come to drop it. Disappointing . not recommended .
"Swiggy was a very good food delivery app in its initial days but its getting pathetic now, I have ordered food multiple times in the last month from the app but every time there had been an issue either with the quantity or the quality, yes they deliver food on time but what is the point of that if the food is stale or not worth of the price paid, so yesterday I ordered a combo of Chicken Biryani and dal makhni and surprisingly what I received was veg pulav with not even one peice of chicken and some bitter tasting stale gravy, I contacted customer service though they gave me a refund but my mood was really spoiled because of this experience."
I ordered 2 burger meals from Mc. Donalds. and got only half the order delivered. Swiggy did not help resolve the problem. Swiggy did not give a refund
"I recently moved houses and I updated my new address I reside in malad and the location picked up was bandra west, little realising this has happened I placed an order the next day and the order was sent to the bandra location, I did cancel my order and informed them of the situation they still charged me 200 for the cancellation fee after texting with one of the members of the staff from swiggy I asked them y this was happening he responded with I request you to put the location off while placing the order. The service was utterly rubbish wen this is not the fault of the customer they should accommodate a compensation. They shouldn't be charging the customers anything. I would not recommend this app to anyone."
Swiggy. Great service in food delivery. Was very helpful and on time for old couples especially when hospitalized. Keep up your service.
"Kindly remove and erase all my information from your company data centre.  On 19th June 2019 I placed an order from Bamboo Hut(Order #44031564672). It's a long story but your company employs an aggressive, dangerous driver.  His name was Pramod, he threatens to beat me and that is unacceptable to treat a customer in any sort or kind of company.  I have a feeling that this was all planned as I refused an order the previous day due to hygiene reasons( the food was under the scooter under seat storage with no handbags or bags covered(of course papaer bags and the driver was so rude too and stopping me taking a picture). It was a horiible expereince.  So back to June 19, 2019, incident, Your driver created a scene in my office campus and he even called his friends to join him in beating me up. I am afraid that he might even come back to kill me.  Please please remove my details.  I also called your customer care but after I shared my story they hung up on me.  Please erase all my information for the safety of my life.  I know as I am not from Delhi you will not care about this but I am human too.  find my information from Order #44031564672  Thank you"
"2000/- is deducted from ma accounts, bt the order was not placed. I highlighted ma problem to swiggy executive regarding it, got confirmation dat amount will be credited in 4business day.. it has been week no action has been taken yet..  Unsatisfied customer"
They used to be super fast with delivery. I infact used to believe that this was their USP but they're just lagging with this as well. I'm going to delete my account since other services are much faster than swiggy
Order is missing items.  Customer Exec says we refund only for the missing piece.  What you fail to understand is food delivery is different from delivery of other products.  What am I supposed to do with just chappatis if my curry is missing!  And then you refuse to take back the order and give me full refund.
"Swiggy takes an order, confirms the order, I get delivery guys ph no too. After one hour of wait Swiggy calls and says sorry the order can’t be delivered!!!!!! Because the delivery guy is not ready to bring it!!!!! Rubbish service  Guess what? This is not the first time I have received a"
Don't have sense how to talk to customer  So irresponsible delivery executive  Don't have any good policy  Worst service ever  Don't have that much courrage to accept their mistake
Poor back end team who is not ready to service customer  As if they run a charity business  The response was very poor after placing my order  Never expected this
"How come one can start preparing food exactly after 1 min of placing order , was trying to alter my order they wanted to charge 200 /- towards cancellation within a minute  And very cooly replying that was their company policy  Exactly within a minute"
"I know this comment is not going to go to swiggy and they're not going to change themselves. I came here to write just because to relieve my anger. It happened to us thrice. We've given the complete address but then I have no idea why the deliveryman is not at all entering the house and always waiting for us to pick up their call. When we don't pick up their call within ten minutes they're automatically cancelling our order and giving a refund minus ₹200 as cancellation fees.  I totally don't understand this system. How can we always be with our mobile ready to pick up their call ? Won't we have any emergency work or emergency call? How can they automatically cancel my order and ask me to place the order again? I already waited for one hour and now I have to wait for another hour to get my food. We could have bought food from elsewhere. But is this how they'll keep their customers hungry when the customers keep their trust on them ?  Three times my order got cancelled just because I didn't pick up the call. I don't know why the hell they don't come and find our house instead of calling us. And they give only ten minutes deadline otherwise they cancel automatically.  I didn't get the food, I'm hungry, I have to wait for another hour, all these are not at all my mistake but they deduct ₹200 as cancellation fees. And who did the cancellation ? Not me but them . This is pissing off me the most. Why should I pay for they did cancel my order ? Its not at all my fault!  Three times I did bear with this but now I've decided I'm never gonna use swiggy again at all. I can get the food from my nearby restaurants. But why swiggy when I can do that ? Why do they bring such delivery companies when they can't do that delivery properly ? Few years ago we got the food on our own. Why do they bring such apps and make us fool and keep us hungry ? We would get our food as we did before and we'd get even quicker ! Thanks for your service. Thanks mouthshut for giving me a space to rant all my concerns. Finally thank you swiggy."
"Bestest site .I had ever seen , because here we can good quality eatables and by applying codes we can get some % less on our food orders.Here we can find restaurants near by and their ratings already aprice lower than market price , that's why nowdays we can see that people are aware and choose good decisions by ordering through these apps ."
"I order 4 masala dosai and 5 idli, but they deliver only 1 masala dosai and 5 idli.very worst.They did not follow up what the customer need."
"What does Swiggy do? Get food from hotels and deliver home, and that is what they do the worst. We've faced this multiple times do not deliver on time, incomplete delivery of orders, cancellation of orders after 1 hour of placing order. Also food delivered doesn't seem to be of the same quality as had in the restaurant from where it is ordered. Not sure if they get it from some other low quality restaurant.  Terrible experience, would not recommend Swiggy to anyone"
Worst experience I had with swiggy....My amount got debited and no order was placed..No satisfy solution given by customer care... Please don't order from swiggy if u value money
"There is no custimer care number, no chat box executive who will be available on weekends. Order will not deliver to you, bit you get the message that it is delivered! Pathetic service. Ordered food at 12:17pm and its 2:02pm and still no information!"
"Dear all, since I completed 6 months in swiggy company , yes many of them complaint about swiggy delivery system , ofcourse like that their job is bit difficult to do because their salary package and reward is no good , I am working as parttime on 5 to 12 pm on all working days , you all mean that swiggy delivery boys get more salary when compared to other private sectors but real thing is that if we do delivery around 4km we get only 35rs only , at the time of my work iget only 3-5 order daily through app between the time of 5-12pm so now you can calculate our daily earnings .we find extra money for vehicle maintenance from our pocket , so it is terrible job , their reward is not useful .other delivery jobs is better than this.easy to join but its more difficult to sustain .so all candidates are resign from this job with in 2days , and freshers lost their joining money of 1000rs this money we spend at the time of joining , using this money they give me 2 Tshirts and a delivery bag, that is not worth and reusable because of brand name attached , .now they are selling this product as buissness because employees can withstand only maximum 1weeks and they seek another job so they lost their joining money of 1000and it is not refundable at the time of resign .so swiggy is worst for employees"
"The cake I have received in a very bad condition, all broken into pieces. Also delivery boy was unaware about location and very inexperienced."
"I had placed an order and as the delivery person had issues with his vehicle I was told to cancel my order. I had already paid via UPI and its been 15 days since I haven't recieved a refund. Everytime i try to contact the helpline service just send the same message saying refund will be made withing 2 -4 days. But 15 days hence, I havnt got any refund. Really pathetic!!"
I have done googlepay for an order. It timedout after successful payment. The items are still in cart and no order generated. I report this on customer service chat and the representatives ask me to contact google pay. I guess Swiggy is swindling money this way.  Guys beware opt only for COD otherwise we have no way to get our money back if something happens after electronic payment and before order is placed.  There is no customer service number to call or email.  The representatives guys just apologise and close the chat.  Really horrible.
"Swiggy has been declining at the speed of a rocket in terms of their food delivery quality. Time and again I have received wrong orders and very late.. with no assistance on refunds or replacement even after 2 hours of explaining your problem. I am so pissed with Swiggy. First, they sent a non veg pasta instead of veg very gladly and denied to refund/ replace or pick it. Today, I ordered cake for my mother’s birthday and they sent a wrong cake completely spoiled and spilled and the same attitude. I uninstalled it previously but thought of giving it a try today once again but they have failed my expectations and i am now going to suggest the same to my friends and relatives to also uninstall and stop ordering from swiggy. The business will soon go to other efficient partners."
"I have been a daily user of swiggy for the past few months now. However of recent it's delivery time and the condition of delivery has fallen. App features and design are attractive. I had ordered a pastry and it was delayed in delivery and when I open the box the pastry was all over the box, when I complaint the send a replacement which was in a worst condition than previous one. When I contact the customer care they said they will call back no response till date. Swiggy is not concept based, it is totally useless and waste of money swiggys all products are not in fresh condition. I have orderd 3-4 time but every order has complaint."
Swiggy  Live In Mumbai & Tired of heavy traffic & eating at the same old place ?  Lazy to get dressed for ( Dinner/Lunch/Bf) ?  Download Swiggy now  Want to share my personal experience with Swiggy  Its has fastest dilivery service . Order at 8: 30 pm and got my food by 9: 00pm. Great packaging as well as food was still fresh & hot.  Also the information given of the restaurant on the site was very useful to find out the best Chinese restaurant in South Mumbai and fast delivery was just an ice on the cake.  Be there Food/Beverage/Dessert I always use Swiggy to get my type of food and also recommend others to use it too as it very helpful for foodies out there like me : )  Swiggy brings food from best restaurants and deserts to your door step.
Orders a veg thali from ami Bengali restaurant behala. The food smelt spoilt and I had to throw the entire food.
I used to order so frequently but these days swiggy takes lit of time.  1 example - I ordered - for 1 hour I waited and then when I saw my app it was written that they have delivered but I did not get the same.  Then when I inquired that said its delivery boy fault. they gave me replacement.  Again I waited for 45 mins then again they called and said that your food has been cancelled.  I mean you make a person wait for so long.  Why there is a gap in the communication.  We can order from somewhere else then.  They call you and ask for your feedback before even providing you the meal . And if you press 1 i.e I am satisfied - you order time will change and it will take more time.  I am uninstalling this app now.
"Having ordered food, like I normally do from Swiggy, the delivery man, after reaching 300 meters to my house, says he wont come an inch ahead unless I paid him extra. Then argues that my GPS location was not correct, which is possible, I am no denying it could have been a little wrong, but the address was 100% correct.  I requested him to come straight and take a right, near about 300 meters ahead, he says no unless I paid him extra money. After refusing to pay more, he started arguing and wasted almost 20 mins of his time and mine on this stupid argument, the ordered showed as canceled and I was issued a refund.  I had ordered food for me, my mom and dad, and it was during a special occasion, and what pisses me off the most is that all restaurants were closed by that time, and we were left hungry with no option to by some off the shelf Maggie from the near by 24/7 pharmacy.  Rest assured, I wont be ordering from Swiggy ever again. Zomato provides better experiences, just pay extra."
Pathetic service by swiggy  Got very spicy and burnt food and complaint them 100 tomes but they refused to take any action.
"I had offered food through Swiggy around 12.30 PM today and upon waiting for 2 hours they automatically cancelled the order. They called up saying that the restaurant was too far, if the restaurant was far then why did show up in my vicinity. Bad customer service, l and they don’t have the odesity to apologise."
"1st time ordered Foodfrom swiggy today 6  .6.19 at6.41pm from Durgapur West Bengal.Had telephonic conversation with the delivery boy twice of Swiggy. He told he is reaching within 20 minutes. At 7.50pm received a call from swiggythat order is cancelled. Why to wait for 1hour to get a confirmation of cancellation. Delivery boy telling his location of the restaurant is not showing. Is it my fault? Very upset and sad with this type if service. Order was given from Mobile no 9123444809 from Durgapur West Bengal. Very unprofessional and bad service will never order from this app and will recommend all my friends not to order from the swiggy. Zomato is also available but service is excellent.  Rana Roy  Durgapur, West Bengal(713205)  9123444809"
"They are running scam to loot money.I didn't get refund for the order I was forced by their customer care to cancel after waiting for an hr cz their delivery guy was too reluctant to call and his no.was switched off.and they have the worst customer care service, they even demand the customers to talk professionally and tell they will close the chat window if we don't respect them.so basically you have to beg them to get your money back."
"I ordered my food at 1341 hrs and the delivery executive was not assigned until I called them for couple of times and multiple times I wrote on their app as well . I had ordered from McDonald's - 1 mcchicken spicy meal and anywhere in the world they won't take more than 20 mins to prepare that order .  The response from their helpline executive was always the same that they will look into it and assign an executive which took them more than one hr when I called them they said that you location is too far that is why it is taking so long , so they should remove that outlet from their app if they can't deliver . And when executive was assiy it still shows another 41 mins to be deliver . I think these guys should down immediately instead of playing with someone's food and hunger."
"I am found of ordering g food online but this app made my interest low.Very very slow delivery .I request the respected company to provide the delivery agents with some vehicle .They take time to come paddling .Even the food delivered as rotten and stale.However the delivery took 2 hours to give so called'tasty and delicious food on doorstep'.l asked for some compensation so the agent on quiry chat promised to credit 100Rs in my account but these ministers of promises credited a beggary of 30Rs stating that we never make such token of apologies but if u have concerned screenshots we would take the matter under consideration.Sending screenshots I got a small reply in 5 minutes ""sorry mam we cannot consider"". Pls yr Be stable on ur words!"
Yesterday I and my friends have ordered some things from swiggy app and it shows that your order will come to you in 30 minutes and it is approx 1 hour 7 minutes and my order doesn't come and my friends was gone because they were late for their coaching and I was very upset because my friends were gone and the order came to me at 1 hour 20 minutes. So I have said to my parents to eat the food with me to not waste the food and the food was literally bad and the quality is worse so my parents also declined to eat the food with the first bite and I was very angry and upset because my money has gone . So this is the worst app and I will personally recommend you to not buy food from swiggy .
I have been trying swiggy for a long time but what happened to me today was very bad. I ordered from a restaurant which was literally 2 kms away from my destination and the eta was 45 minutes. After an hour i tried to contact the delivery person and he said that i am stuck in some mishap with the vehicle. I tried to talk with the executives and they were so ignorant about the situation and at the end i was bound to cancel the order which resulted in me sleeping hungry as it was 11.55 pm.
Ordered food on Swiggy and after an hour of waiting the customer care calls and says they haven't received an order in the restaurant because of system failure and are cancelling the order. I would never recommend this service to any one ever!
I hv ordelrl for food and without my knowledge the food got cancelled and deducted 70 rs. It's disgusting. Worst experiencem I will never order.
"Ordered Ice Cream From Baskin Robin, Received without Bill, Also, Quantity is not as per the ordered value, Worst Customer Care Service."
"Variety of issues faced  1) missing food... Few items not delivered although charged. Had to call customer care to get a refund  2) app accepted order from a restaurant and the delivery guy called to inform (after waiting for thw food for long) that the shop is closed.  3) on another occasion, the customer care called after a long time to inform that the delivery guy dropped the food  4) on another occasion, delivery guy wasn't assigned for a very long time... had to call the customer care to get a guy assigned and hence food was delivered very late  5) Issues with billing. Wrong amount charged. Had to call customer care to get the refund"
The chat executives are not educated and they dont know what to say . if we ask them a question they respond with a bot .  I am sorry I couldnt help . No proper response .
"Swiggy only serves stale food... I've ordered food 3 times using swiggy, and all the times it has delivered stale and contaminated food... The food smells very bad.. Zomato is much better than swiggy."
"SWiGGY is one of the fastest growing delivery orders.  I have ordered pizzas, McDonald, Burger King, Ice cream from Baskin Robbins, Natural Ice cream, Apsara Icecream, Havmor and they have done deliveries on time.  Congratulations Swiggy is doing a fine job and its time people took a cue in ordering online anyplace, anywhere, anytime as per their timings.  Young graduates males who want to earn some pocket money should take this as an option till they find a permanent job  Cheers!"
"The fellow went to some two km away address and called me.  When I gave him my exact address, which was already in my profile; he bluntly refused to delivery the order when i tried to guide him for the adress.  And said that go on write what you want to write in your review.  After that a series of irritating calls started from swiggy about cancelling the order.  Which i refused as i was denied delivery by this delivery executive and i had not cancelled the order.  This is my order with swiggy, and as it is always quoted..  First impression is .., ..., ....."
Hi this is hima from Australia swiggy drivers stricking in india because of wages we also doing UBER here do you know how much they giving respect to us if we cancel the order they give full amount for that order but you people really disgusting we are getting 10$ per delivery you know what it means 500/- per delivery in India you are giving 35/- per delivery and now you made it 6/- they can’t get cup of tea with this money you people should give respect to drivers if they doing their job then only you will earn money on them please give respect to them because they don’t need swiggy ....swiggy needs them. You should remember thank you
"Totally Good job which is depending upon the function of working places because we are going the road side and search the hotels when order is picked and get the food and given to the customer, There is no time limit for this job.you will get the pay by how much you work .I like to work in this company.but I need a change by switching over to another job."
"I received food that was clearly spoilt, when I spoke to the customer care, they offered replacement. It did not come and they offered 30rs coupon for a dish that cost 200!! And inspite of telling them repeatedly that the food was rotten n not fit for consumption, they did not do anything about it."
"Kept me waiting for two hours with hunger in the night and finally said that delivery cannot be executed. Helpdesk executive is not bothered about your time and inconvenience.Very bad attitude towards customers, never ever I will use swiggy again."
Had an extremely horrific experience on an order placed on swiggy.  Please shut down the company. This is not the way to operate
"Not once, twice , this is third time I'm experiencing the worst delivery. Out of three items I have ordered , got one complete different item and another item has missing items and they are saying best thing they can do is they'll consider my feedback. Three times the same happened, repeating mistakes again and again. Fed up with swiggy ????"
"This was my 1st order from Swiggy and the experience was too bad, I have ordered a Jain Chat I have mentioned in the specifications without Onion and garlic C5 Tiffins and Chat has accepted my request still I have received the chat with lots of onion, which I can't have nor replace the order, there is no refund for the order, instead they have given me a coupon code to use it next time when I order from Swiggy, which is already available online. The order got delivered 1 hour after placing the order"
This happened today..I got one of the worst service from Swiggy.. I ordered my food from restaurant Morison Bano based in indiranagar blore.. order was placed at 7.30 pm..I waited for more 45 min and then called the deliver executive who confirmed that he will deliver the order in 10 min.. At about 8.30 I receives call from Swiggy saying that my food has been lost and some other delivery executive has taken my order.. I called the call center and they said they cannot do anything and I have to reorder my food.. They committed to refund my money.. but that’s not the solution as myself and my family had suffered for someone else mistake.. To satisfy me they gave a 500 coupon as a service gesture. However I asked them that I can reorder through them and wanted the delivery in 30 min..One manager by name Nikhil committed that he would track the order as soon as it was placed.. I placed my order agin at 8.48pm.. Till 9.30 pm there was no delivery executive assigned.. Again no sensitivity from Swiggy team.. Finally fed up with these guys I called the customer care again and informed that I will personally pick up the order from the restaurant... I went to the restaurant and the Swiggy delivery person handed over the food at 10 pm.. my entire family including my 2 year old daughter had dinner at 10.30.. The customer care team is useless and is not empathetic .. This is not the first time there is a service issue.. in my last three orders one of the ordered item was missing and all the three orders I have to call the customer care for a refund..my order no 42392097215.. I deleted Swiggy app from my Mobile..I will never use Swiggy again.. poorest service.
The team it self is bullshit and there are two person I dont know exact name one is karthik and other I dont know I wanted to get my resturant attach eith swigy they wasted my 4months saying that they will attach me but still I want to talk with head person my number is  7619683965  Sharma  Iam adding those two persons number  +91 89041 11992 karthik  And other  +91 99166 00711
I am a regular customer of swiggy. Today it showed a new restaurant and I placed order to my home address. After 15 mins I get a call from customer care executive saying this address is too far for this restaurant and we are cancelling the order and you will have to pay fine of Rs.200 on your next order. I explained her that I have placed order to the right address and I still need it so why should I pay fine. She said it's company policy. It was very disappointing aand bad customer service.
Today(31/05/19) I was traveling in KUKATPALLY area....the swiggy delivery executive with 1641 vechile n.o is so rash in driving..even he hit me with his bike... he's started an argument with me instead being sorry....I hate swiggy and ask my friends and colleagues to uninstall the app... they're are so excited to quarrels....he almost looks like an gunda ... I request swiggy to look after this...1641 is the vechile n.o balaji Nagar is the area.....
I am a daily customer of SWIGGY. Important word is daily. Today my delivery boy was Somayya. This guy rang the bell at least 5 times within 2 minutes. When I reached the door and asked what was the issue he started shouting and arguing. When I said I will complain and closed the door he used slang for me in Kannad thinking I won't understand that.when I went back and asked what he just said. He replied do what you want I can take care of it. It was clear this guy was total unprofessional so I just went back and could clearly hear him using still using offensive language. I appreciate all the delivery executive who come irrespective of weather and traffic conditions but this behavior spoils it all. I contacted SWIGGY customer care and have raised my concern they informed I will get an update on what action has been taken. Still there has been no update. Frankly this type of people should be removed to keep the good name of company. This guy's phone number is 9663409050.
"I am a frequent Swiggy user, use swiggy in different cities including Bangalore and Chennai. So I ordered some food today, they accepted the order, payment is made, showed delivery time 45 minutes. After 30 minutes of receiving the order, their customer care called me and told that the food I ordered is not available in the restaurant, and whether I would like to go for some other options they gave. When I chose one, they now asking for more money. This has happened for second time with me that they are changing order and asking for paying more than what I chose.  This is how they are now cheating people."
"So I ordered food from swiggy and at first, they received my order and gave me a confirmation message and after waiting for about an hour they call us up and ask our address only to inform us that the order has been cancelled as there has been a strike on swiggy's side today. I feel they should have informed us or not accepted the order at all. this isn't the first time but has happened in the past also  LOOKING FORWARD TO BETTER SERVICE NEXT TIME:(:("
With out food availability they put items in menu after that with out customer permission they will cancelled the order they dot give the replacement food also very very poor service.even customer support also din't give any correct response for the issue.
Order delivered incomplete by Swiggy and payment collected in full by Swiggy. On top of it all they refuse to attend to any complaint. There is no system for the customer to call or contact Swiggy on phone. They only have a way to chat wherein they do not respond for long time and you are made to wait for their response.
Very very worst service ever. I ordered at 12.49 pm but till 2.30 that deliver guy has not came. I called to swiggy CC but they are elling some bulshits and finally they cancelled my order and deduct cancellation charges also. Eventhough the delivery boy cant able to deliver the food
Sorry for writing a bit late.I ordered a few food items from swiggy on 27th of May however i would like to bring it to your notice that in those items i had ordered chicken manchow soup however what i got is neither chichen manchow soup nor veg manchow soup rather it was the curry of triple schezwan rice.how can people betray you on the name of business.if you can't send soup then dnt send but dont fool around people.i hope i get a genuine answer regarding this.The name of the restaurant is Zaika restaurant located in lohegaon pune.
"Its 12 at night and I waited for my food for 1 hour, the delivery boy called me twice I explained him address and after 1 hour he said I ll not be able to dilver you food. I ll not be able to have my dinner tonight. What kind of staff you hire nd how irresponsible they are. I sujjest please do not rely on this app. Please try anything else but not swiggy"
"This app really useful, I and my wife are employees some times we work late hours, so we dont have enough time to cook this app really help full for us. Some times it makes us disappointed because of the late delivery, in vizag their services are very good in time they take orders. my self this app is useful."
I want to share with you my personal experience about swiggy app and it is very useful all for all the foods when you installed app.  when I order food I get time to time delivery and price is better than zomato it is so easy to use and fast delivery I realy satisfied with this you can order any time and get fresh food always  i recommend this for all who want installed and used this app  thanks
"They have cheap prices and very poor quality food. Sometimes food is smelly or missing. Can't say enough words to show how bad this company has become. They just want to bring people to their platform at the costs of their health. If I met the CEO of this company, I would have%#^@ him for comprising people's health. Shameless people work in Swiggy."
Try to develop swiggy near my place...I'm from GUDIVADA...I am also waiting to experience the swiggy. Try to develop swiggy in my place also I hope you will develop swiggy near my place very soooon......!  Thanks  Pin:-521-301  Krishna district  Thank you
Worst experience from the online food delivery website.last day i order some food from swiggy they said that the delivery boy will reach before 30 minites but he came only after 50 minites with no specific reason.the package is not good and unhygienic food.idon't eat and i lost my money.
Food is worst and customer support is also worst...........................................  There is no value for money they did not provide me the bill from the restaurant and food tastes like from street side..............................worst worst worst....
"Restaurant confirmed order and delivery executive was assigned after that i was informed by the delivery executive that restaurant was closed. Swiggy did nothing about the complain, Simply cancelled the order and said to reorder, What if swiggy should check which restaurant is open and closed, should i do that too as a user, after oreder getting confirmed how restaurant can be closed"
I was feeling hungry at 2 in the night thus ordered Shahi paneer with butter naan from swiggy to my surprise they delivered and it was damn tasty. I really loved their operational execution capability and salute to their technical skill sets.  Keep up the good work.
"Swiggy is recently started in my city and I like the most about that they have listed all restaurants so I can choose my favorite restaurant and track my order and food delivery is quick, it is anytime convenient in ordering . So far my experience with Swiggy is good."
"I just placed order 22 May 2019.  The delivery executive was totally rude and arrogant.  I have been ordering through swiggy over a year now on the same location but the executive who delivered today' said i have given wrong location, and they cannot keep looking at the address for delivery..when he came down for delivery I showed him what land mark and address is given and he started giving vague and rude response. This is my 5th similar incident, and I h"
"I ordered 3 ice creams from natural icecream. I did not intially get otp for logging in. It was not a network issue as I got other sms and calls at the same time. I somehow logged in and it detected my current location. I did not get an option to select my address. Still when I ordered I quickly turned to chat window within 10 secs of ordering for cancelling the order. The order was yet to be confirmed. I asked the person to cancel it ...they asked what is the distance between my home and work location. I told them that, my home location is nearer to the restaurant as compared to my office. They just did not reply for 3-4 mins and then said ""I can cancel but INR 97 will be deducted"". I got outrageous and told them I have been trying to cancel it the second ordered it. I told them cancel it and I have money ...I didn't want to be ride but had no choice. To my surprise the delivery guy called me and asked to receive the order. They did not cancel it for half and hour and again said ""you did not confirm order cancellation"". I sent them the screenshot when I said cancel it. They finally cancelled it after half and hour which clearly shows they wanted money just because their app sucks , support persons cheat and so does Swiggy. No more swiggy not at all recommended. I will rather go with UBER EATS. Hate swiggy ...yes sadly after using it since last 3 years."
"Good food for every citizen. Healthy production, clean dilivery, perfect time reached the order, swiggy is the one of the best food production and we will call as, mother of food production finally thanks for swiggy .com company and your company is good and don't stop in any case , because people who are interested and like the food,  Thankyou"
"Multiple restaurants are available on Swiggy:  I like most about Swiggy that they have n number restaurants so I can choose my favorite restaurant and track my order and food delivery is quick, it is anytime convenient in ordering . Whenever I feel something wrong in my ordered food, they immediate refund me. So far my experience with Swiggy is good.  What is dislike:  When I order food late night, they had delivered unhealthy and taste less food, so please avoid ordering food late night.  My recommendations:    Please do not order food at late night .    If you feel anything wrong with food, immediately talk to customer support, they always available for you.    Do not order your food at early morning because most of the restaurants, hotels do not accept your order.    If you get something less in your order, suppose if any item missed, immediately talk to customer support, they will deliver new order without any payment."
"I ordered from a restaurant through the swiggy app on 20:05:2019. The money was deducted from my account( I used online payment as cash on delivery was blocked) but the order was never placed. The order was for 465 Rupees. This is the third time this has happened. The first time it was for an order of around 150 rupees. So I didn’t feel like spending my time and effort to fight for it. The next time it was for an order of around 650 rupees. I got in contact to the customer support executive through the helpline present in the app. They explained how gateways work in detail though I know how it works and told them so again and again. Before I could ask for further details they closed the conversation both the times. I found it very rude and unprofessional. When I tried calling them, I couldn’t understand a word they were saying cause they were speaking so fast and the words were incomprehensible. I was still ordering from swiggy after the first incident as it was familiar but am willing to learn to use the other apps after today’s experience."
I ordered 5may for 765 rupeees still i never got my money back i. Dont know wat they r doing with my hard earned money  And always saying ur money has been transferred check ur bank  This is not right  So if any swiggy employe seeing kinds return my money
"I paid 396/- for food at 2am at night but delivery boy didn't turned up and I got a message it is delivered and when I called the executive Ashok Ak, 096066 29116 he is tell that it been delivered and I asked where did you delivered he mentioned the location this is 1 km far from my location and I complained in customer care they said kindly follow the executive once again and closed the chat and the guy is not picking the call.. dear Bangalorian please don't get cheated by this company seriously God will show them the lesson"
"I've had 7 bad experiences with swiggy, Always tried to understand them but couldn't tolerate when they did it the 8th time, They will take orders from the restaurant that's unserviceable but will let you know about it when the delivery executive reaches there then they will say the order can't be delivered, By the time the hunger gets on your nerves already because it is after almost an hour that they'll tell you about it, My question is why did the restaurant confirm the order at first place, When complained the customer care will say that the item you ordered isn't there Then just replace it with another? but the delivery executive will say somethings wrong with their restaurant, Like they themselves don't know what to answer, Some customer care executives weren't even helpful. Once they delivered the wrong order too. If they can't handle such stuffs stop the services or if you call annoying your customer is your slogan you're doing that pretty well. Wouldn't even give 1 rating it it was an option"
"Order from Burger King was prepaid but delivery boy did not bring full order, King fries and combo drinks and fries were not there so I had to cancel the order. When contacted customer service he was not accepting fault of delivery boy. Though order was cancelled and payment was refunded within 10 minutes."
"While the app and service are quite useful in general, lately the customer support of swiggy has become very inefficient and irresponsible.  I was chatting with a support executive regarding a delayed order. Most of her responses were ready made generic message, which were not at all useful. And even before I was done with my chat with her, she closed the chat window abruptly saying ""you seem to be away""when I had sent a message less than a minute ago and was writing another message.  Then I reopened the chat and I was connected to another support executive. I explained her the order related issue and how the previous support executive left the chat window abruptly. She made an attempt to resolve the order related issue, but again she too left the chat window abruptly while I was still saying something.  By the way the order took almost 1.5 hours, where as the estimated time of arrival at the time of ordering was 43 minutes. Occasional delays are natural for various reasons, but at least the customer service must be responsible, which is missing in swiggy.  Overall, I have been having a very bad experience with the swiggy's customer support lately and I would rather switch to zomato or something. Hoping to see Amazon launch its food delivery service soon in India. At least they have a great customer service."
"I had worst service, They cancelled my food. After accepting it n I paid online n after they didn’t send me my refunded amount , , they are cheating people while telling not returning our money .. today they send me stale food .. I n didn’t wanted to take action on that I want to give them one star but this is not accepting it .. it’s saying a product worth your recommendation worth 3 star like really you don’t even want us to give you the star which we want to give .. worst service .. just wastage of time n money .."
"Delivery guys for 2 of my 3 orders have brought wrong orders. 1 of them didn't even bring back the right order, thus having the money I paid for it held up by them. Customer service was vague and unhelpful. All they could do was place the order again(which I could have done manually too).  Do yourself a favour and use Zomato or something, I know I won't use this again. I have never had any bad experience with any other app, but just 3 orders into this disappointment of an app/company and I have to deal with this.  Don't use this if you want to wait 3 hours for your food, while an incompetent customer service person just apologizes to you saying they cannot do any better than place the order again."
"Swiggy playing with games with customers by holding their money, It's been more than a month that I didn't receive reversal of my amount and there is no proper response swiggy. we thought this is one the good product but these guys screwed us by holding our money"
Very worst...  I order food for 356 rs it actually located my location so I placed my order and the location got changed so I contacted swiggy they gave me a worst reply saying that i can't deliver it to the another address but it auto located some wrong address... Who's mistake is this... They charged me 180 RS for cancellation... Very bad I going to file consumer complaint in DCDRF
"I ordered food today afternoon at 1430hrs, the order was accepted by the restaurant also I made the payment online payment was also sucessful, I was waiting for the food at around 1520 I received a call from swiggy saying that one item was there and the other item was not available with the restaurant...., wanted to speak to the manager the agent hung up the call in me after 3 times I did speak to a supervisor asked why the order was accepted when the restaurant did not have raw material, she told that she was not sure , asked her to credit the money back to the account instantly, she refused, wanted to speak to her manager after a lot of haste she transferred the call, the manager was trying to sort on coupons , i denied as I paid money through card and wanted the money back immediately on my card but he declined and told that it would take 5 to 7 working days, Now the question is Swiggy would enjoy the interest of my money and would credit the same , wonderful. :( this is the way they treat the customer I would not recommend anybody to use swiggy for food as they are the worst and also they are unprofessional. Still I had to agree for 5 to 7 days as there was no other options to get the cash back to the card.....???????? u was hungry all throughout afternoon.Also I do have a recording of the conversation done with one of he manager"
I ordered food on 5-may-19(sunday) and paid then the restaurant called me and said that this is not available and instead try bla bla bla. when I refused she said u will get the refund in 7 working days.when I told swiggy that I haven't received refund then they say take this no and call them. it's ridiculous.
"I am residing in tripura, and swiggy service has come many months ago. When it came to our city I thought now it would be easy to get various item at my house with out going to any place.I was very eager to place order.  Bt the service it not as my expectations. First thing is most of the time when I open the app, I find a sentence 'service unavailable'. Very few times I got the service bt that aslo, they didnt come in given time.  Even sometime they used to come at wrong address. They dont know the road map of tripura. I am just fed up with the service.  My only request is to please provide the service properly and make it available all the time"
"Unprofessional behavior by swiggy delivery guy. I called to check the status of my order, swiggy delivery guy told me that he is available on other location my location is showing 1 km distance on which he cannot delivered, If you can come and pick your order otherwise contact with swiggy and I cant deliver the order. Kindly take the strict action on delivery guy Bhupesh."
"Pathetic customer service, no accountability taken for incorrect order, poor quality and non delivery.. customer service is not at par with market standards... I’ve had 3 instances of incorrect/non delivery but none in d team has taken responsibility to correct the concern... switch to other providers as Swiggy is definitely going in the wrong direction"
"Ordered chicken Biryani and after taking few spoons realised it's not chicken. May be mutton or also beef. Restaurant: Kumarakom, HSR, Bangalore. Tried reaching swiggy by the only way possible- call and they just kept me waiting with that irritating music. Also couldn't give review to restaurant from the app. Would have sued both restaurant and swiggy if we were in a country where consumer rights are respected."
Its an extremely arrogant n unprofessional behaviour by swiggy delivery guy.  He was literally shouting on the call when I called up n ask about status of my order  As his number wasn't available when I trying to reach him out.  They just don't knw how to serve n behave to the customer at all.  Very very annoying experience till date.  Not recommended swiggy.  Please look in to this and expecting strict action  Delivery guy num- 9326573960  Suryakant pol
Not able to serve at ghy more over showing as high cost... amount got debited even  But  No  Food...  ..  ..  Why..  Why....  If one wait for smoe  Function nd food does not come post amount debited from account what an embracing situation it is .
"Had ordered from them , they kept me waiting till the delivery time ie 50 minutes and when that was up that was an hour more . On calling them I wasn’t given a clear answer as to whether the food will arrive or not. what’s worse is Swiggy refuses to answer any calls or queries. I have still not received my order and not any call from either Bistro 37 or Swiggy . With my experience today , I wouldn’t even like to rate it 1 but I have to . Totally disappointed with swiggy’s service."
Worst experience.. could not track order and the guy turned up after 1n1/2 hr with the food spilled in his bag and then could not cancel n put a complaint about it. Extremely frustrating.. still trying to get my refund but nobody is picking up at customer care!!
I recieve 2 peppy paneer pizza and it was the worst experience i ever had and I also ordered brownie but brownie was not there and no spices werethere in pizza really it's the worst pizza ever..plzz kindly give My money back The pizza was without seasonings.....without vegie toppings .....didn't seemed fresh...and decided to never order again in future.. From PIZZA WORLD...
I ordered my food from the bowl company. Accidentally I put sector 17b instead of A. Delivery boy reached 12 and before 5 mins to deliver it self I called and explained about my mistake and asked him to deliver the food to right address which was hardly 7 mins away as per GPS. Delivery boy refused and I got a call from swiggy customer service. Someone from Bangalore called me and argued about wrong the address. I tried explaining both the member that address is just 5 mins away and he knows the address too however no one agreed. I was in Delhi cant I chose to drive all the way to Sector 17 Gurgaon to get my food. I was on call for 20 mins where dumb swiggy delivery boy and customer service was still arguing about the wrong location. I drove a little fast all the way from Delhi to Gurgaon and picked my order on my own.  Swiggy customer service was adamant not to deliver so as the delivery boy.  Being a such a huge brand I didn’t expect such stupidity from swiggy.  Anyways it doesn’t matter how big brand you are but if you just can’t be logical towards serv
"Toady i placed an order for Dal Makhni and Mashroom Masala at around 2:00 PM and after waiting for more than one hour i received a single slice of sandwich. I asked to the delivery boy that this is not my order you gave me wrong one he said its not my mistake you can cancel the order and don't complaint against me and he went away. I complaint in Swiggy they said fine we will replace the order. Than again i waited for one hour, delivery boy came and went away without giving an order when i asked what happened to my order they said sorry it was damaged. So unprofessional they are, My whole family was starved for almost three hours because of their bad service, I won't recommend SWIGGY to any one, they are so unprofessional and bad server . Don't know why Swiggy runs their app when they are not able to provide food for their costumer in a single day for even two time. Pathetic Service ever. And this is not enough when i asked to refund my money they said we can't refund your money we can provide you the same amount of coupon, Which has validity for some days and it cannot be applicable everywhere. I was shocked, They are such a Cheater , Unprofessional that they can't even refund my whole money almost (Rs400) which i spend for food, that was not even delivered to me. Miserable it was, Don't go for Swiggy ever Otherwise you will Starve for whole day"
"There were consecutive cases here - once the delivery boy never turned up. And after a lot of bickering and argument, managed to get a coupon for a meagre amount which eas no consolation.  Next order - the coupon could never be applied. When enquired the stupid reason cited was a technical glitch for which no compensation was in the offering, just an apology.  Extremely bad and rude customer care. And extremely naive executives, doing anything since they have started thinking they have a monopoly, which is a misconception."
False promises. bad services. they have no control on delivery. continious bad experiences for us. we will not use them again. my entire family uninstalled app today. they delayed delivey. I unserstand it happens sometimes but I expect proper communication when I call customer care. they have no clue with whats happening on field. they were just given bunch of stories to convey close match to consumer. go get fresh food from restaurants yourself. prices are bloated here. quantity is reduced. no validation on hygiene and quality.
"Ordered biriyani from Oudh Kolkata, it cost around 1300 and the food delivered is of 500, the quantity is really less not even for one person and the taste is also different, since I have eaten at the same restaurant. Raised the Issue in Swiggy, they only said they will take actions but what rubbish and bullshit actions they will take they only know, since at the end it's my money.Happened this few more times but last time I am pissed off since the quantity received is just half they give, I have said the representative that this will be my last order from Swiggy, then also the same reply we will take action. I have been a customer for the last 4 years but this kind of action for the customer is really bullshit. First learn how to deal and keep your customers in hand then only the business will grow.  If you guys want to contact me call me on my no-9901520370"
Good app vey easy n convenient to use specially the tracking. Swiggy genie is also a great addition that they have made to the app
"I had ordered a juice and meals, this is same like zomato delivery boy video that went viral. I received only half bottle juice and rice in the meals box was also reduced with curds. When I complaint about this to SWIGGy customer care, they were least bothered to even listen to what I was saying. They were repeatedly saying ""we are sorry for inconvenience and we will inform next supervisor in line about this"". I had to throw the remains of food serviced by SWIGGy for which I had paid around 500/- INR.  My money was all wasted and I was left starving until I went to a near by restaurant.  I can never trust Swiggy again now with my food. Food is such a thing for preparing which we take so much hygiene precautions and it can go for food poisoning.  These people at Swiggy take it very lightly, but I take my health very important.  I hope my experience review helps and warns others about swiggy."
"Your app is not user friendly- mainly for first time users, poor customer service, delay delivery every time even the location is nearby( city), nowadays we are not using swiggy for delay delivery, so we using alter options like other services, please change it & make more innovative"
"I ordered for food at 10 pm and showed that it will reach me within 45 min.After one hour i recieved a msg that my order is cancelled.And when i chat with swiggy executive they even end the coversation without giving me full replies.And by 11pm all the restaurants near my area was closed, and i was asked to sleep with empty stomach."
"I am very thankful to swiggy.because at least you give me a platform to review your service.i am a regular customer of online food apps.and I used many apps.for a change I planned to try swiggy. Thankfully I got 2, 3 order s without any problems..but after that the swiggy people started showing their real face.they will show the items in their list and I will order and pay for the same .after one hour they will call and inform that the same item is not available and they will cancell the order.this is not happen twice or thrice..it happend many times..dear swiggy team I am not that much big to advise you and I am not the only coustomer u have...but just try to understand that in such a service each and every coustomer is important for u so plz try to improve your service..thank you"
"They a very bad in the market in terms of service they find the best way to cheat their customer, even they have created electric fence to not contact them through any medium so easily, They want money not customer satisfaction, CSAT 0% CEOSAT 100% by making more money."
Get best food delivered. You just need to order online and get any food item at a fare price in just a few minutes.order from the best restraunts nearby instead of going there helps you in cutting costs of fuel an reduce global warming.SWIGGY IS a appwhich can bring you food at any time you order so keep ordering and keep promoting the app
"My best suggestion dont use swiggy use other apps, previously used to book a biryani, worst experience coz adress miscommunication, I clearly mentioned but delivery boy went to another place, I requested him delivery to my location he said it's not possible, spoke to customer care dept simply he told that's not possible and he charged some amount, they are not responsibly when you talking with them"
My Restorunt join on swiggy for online food delivery.... But I m very disappointed with Swiggy service.. Swiggy partner sapport system is very bad and irritating..... Every Coustomer sapport Exicetive's gives different Reason on our same Questions... Nothing any manegment on this... Nothing any Reward on mail. No any action on mail and call..... I was feeling like I Just west a time with Swiggy...
"Hi friend's  my name is kedar and today I m going to share my experience about swiggy food delivery platform. in month of jan 2019, I was in banglore and I have ordered cheese chilly toast from chaipoint through swiggy website. and swiggy takes amount for this. when I have got my cheese chilly toast then packing was not so good. and after that when I have strted eating then I feels very bad. bcoz quality was not so good. I have feels that my money goes west. so I not recommended swiggy platform to order food."
Swiggy give good delivery service door to door. I am saying this on my personal experience before few days I order some food through swiggy the order delivered to me on time without any problem and the delivery boy also politely speak with me. And swiggy customer care service also better when I place order after 1 min I received call from swiggy for order conformation. I shared this experience because I give order of food from swiggy first time before I always use zomato.
"If we order food after 9:30pm, the delivery time is getting prolonged and the delivery boys are asking to cancel the order.we have placed order around around 9:30pm and we were waiting for 1hr but we haven't received our order. After one hour the delivery boys are asking to cancel the order, such a worst process...."
A lot of offers have been recently made by swiggy on their andriod and ios based applications.The end results is quality detrioration.I personally have used swiggy now over 25 times and I find the quality and quantity of food deliverd by swiggy is quite low as compared to dining in to the restraunt itself.Do check it out once though!
"Very worst service  the delivery is very slow, he must give delivery near one. but he goes to far away from the order. this is very bad response  very worst service."
The source of supply is generally so un-hygienic that they are virtually playing with lives of people. Food is cooked in bad condition. There used to be bad smell everywhere. Just ask the delivery chaps he can better explain the hygienic condition of the source of supply.
Swiggy is just awsmm....... midblowing...... love it...........best thing about swiggy is that it gives discount on any type of paytm method....food quality and delivery time is also good ....i love swiggy ????????  Very much Happy with this app??????
Thet take money in advance and after 15 to 20 mins they say ordered item is not available. bad service three times my order got cancelled. they called me and offering other items which I dnt want to have. they should conform with the restaurant guys before accepting the payment whether the ordered dish is available or not
Yesterday I ordered the food Order number-#39759580263 but that quality was very bad it was smelling.  Very bad quality .  Kindly do not add those kitchen in your site without test their quality. Even after test that received food I started the vomiting.  This is really very bad experience.  Thanks  Madan  9958505916
"I have uploaded the conversation with the swiggy customer service chat , you guys r the judge .. and please let me know what you think...these online aaps should be given warnings if they are not able to deliver properly. let every one know what is s"
"Have ordered a cake from Cake factory using swiggy, cake factory approved my order and made the delivery executive wait for almost 1 hour 30 min to prepare my cake, after that got a call from delivery executive that they don’t have my cake, and 3 swiggy executive in name of helping me with my concern begging me for good rating and feedback..are u kidding me ..fooling innocent customers and cheating dem with fake concern and list bothered to update us...Now consoling me to cancel d order....This is how u treat ur customer......Never trust swiggy n Cake factory...a very disappointed customer"
And yet another disappointment from swiggy. I did not receive my order at all. Called several times and they said wait fro 10 miniutes more. After waiting 3 hours they said restaurant is closed. Hilarious! Total opposite of swiggy cares. It shoud say swiggy sucks:D
I ordered food from swiggy and they delivered me the wrong order. I contacted with them and asked for my refund but they just ignored it. very rude customer service. I ordered cold coffe and pasta and I got pao and chai that not even cost half of it. THE SHITEST WEBSITE EVER.
Wrong item delivery ..  This is totally irresponsible work ??  Not good... I'll never order again in this site.  I ordered american corn and they delivered me baby corn chilli...Now i have no any option to exchange this! So i will never preffer any one to order from swiggy
"Please calculate the discounted amount, they show something else in discount and apply something else. please do calculate the food delivery as well as restaurant charges.  Moreover, the delivery charges as well as restaurant charges vary as per the food you order. If you order for less amount they increase the restaurant as well as delivery charges, while from the same restaurant if you order for more amount meal, then the delivery as well as restaurant charges differs. so, be careful."
"Hi, I have been using swiggy food delivery app for almost 1 year, and am very happy with its services. Recently I have also subscribed for Swiggy super. The discounts and cash backs are cool. Wide range of hotels and food outlets.  If you dont like the food quality, or any missing items, or any unwanted thing found in the order then you can call or complain about it. And the amount will be refunded.  Quick delivery services with on going status of the order.  One of the best food delivery service provider."
"I am from Thane and ordered food from Raghuvel restaurant on 29th April 2019 at 12.30pm, even after 30 mins I have not received confirmation from restaurant. I contacted Swiggy customer care and informed, response I got that your food will be delivered shortly. After 1 hour I called executive assigned and he said restaurant is closed. My question is how come they keep saying food will be delivered if restaurant is closed, shouldn't they be checking before committing customers. I finally cancelled order and placed with other restaurant over phone. I would not recommend Swiggy for their irresponsible behaviour, indecent communication and very ordinary service. I wanted to rate them zero but I cannot so 1 that is more than enough"
"I had couple of nasty experiences with swiggy earlier as well and didn't bother much as we do face issues once or twice. However, it seems, it is their normal way of working. The recent bad and the last one, as I will never use it again, is(was) on 28th April, 2019. I ordered food around 8:45 and was waiting for it desperately as I was starving. After some 20-30 mins., I checked the status and it says delivered though I didn't receive any order. I contacted them through chat and all they said is we apologise for inconvenience and disconnect abruptly. Here I am trying to get my food even after 2 hours of placing the order and all in vain. No food was delivered and they want a week to give my money back for their incompetence. I am not going to use this anymore and would not encourage my folks to use it. Very bad customer service. 0 star."
"Our Areas newly launched the swiggy but fastly people accepted this idea, swiggy provide reasonable discounts, but Sales boys were not properly behaving, her some time insulting customers and some salesboys were had smokers, and that reasons were diminishing the swiggy rates. iam Jaison from Calicut"
"Hi, this was my first order on swiggy. I had ordered ice cream on 27-04-2019, the taste of ice cream was not Usual and was very bad .And it was completely melted, I had a chat with Mr Oskar Horo and Mr. Saurav regarding my issues, but the response was very bad and impolite. First learn to talk to the customers. I would never recommend swiggy to any."
Poor service and serves poor quality of packaging and half eaten. I have ordered 2 ice creams from cream stone and they have sent completely melted product without adding the dry ice . They do not have minimum common sense to add dry ice especially in the summer which will keep the ice cream without melted . By the time I revived one Ice cream is like milk shake and the other one is only half . When I contacted the customer service and reported this issue they send me some predefined statement I apologise . Very disappointed the way our concern is addressed
"I received incomplete order from Kitchens of Punjab(rating was 4.1).  Inspite of multiple chats with Swiggy customer service, Swiggy is not able to completely deliver the order. They got something delivered but still its not the complete order.  Neither are they refunding me.  Customer service people are only keen to close the conversation saying they will take care of this in future.  The restaurant number is not available to speak with them directly.  Very unhappy with my order today!"
"Swiggy has worst delivery system and pethatic customer service, fuced up customer service, this is 3rd time they cancelled my order and they also charged me 79rs saying that I cancelled the order, when they cancel the order they should also refund 79rs to my account when it's not my mistake, I was starving so many times because the pethatic service that swiggy has, I tried chatting with customer service, chat rep Amreen was so slow and irrelevant answer and then she said sorry and closed the chat, it is so annoying and mind fuced, I seriously don't understand what srihrash, nandan and rahul is doing, wake up guys server your customer well, we are not ordering jwells or clothes to reorder next time, IT'S FOOD, we are hungry that's why we order food can't you guys understand this simple thing, after cancelling the order I should wait 7 to 9 days to get the refund, why the hell should I wait for 9 days when it's not my mistake, I need my refund immediately and also the 79rs cos you idiotic people cancelled the order even after the delivery guy was ready to get the order, If I don't get the refund immediately, be ready to face the consequences, reviews can easily break a brand, keep that in mind who ever is bladi responsible for customer service."
There service is very good in our area.i m using it in kolkata.here u can order food bevarages from the resturant u like in your locality.m.they.alw come in time.unlimited choices.i m there regular customer as I m big foody.the behaviour of d delivry boys are good.the food thy bring is good.i have no complain with their service.someone who never tried online food easily go for it.trust me.u can get very good discount .
They are money minded what they think is they can return money if the item is not delivered irrespective of the time of the order delivery.Fought lot many times and there is no use they are not accepting mistakes no token of apology. even if u die because of hunger due to their mistake they still can refund money nothing more than that. Fed up after 15 times and writing this review
"I ordered food from swiggy yesterday (26/04/2019) since I was hungry firstly ordered food got delivered in more than 40 minutes in between just to convince me I was getting calls from swiggy to say sorry that food is getting late to deliver. Still I was ok.  Food came I opened that than I was just about to eat that food I saw mosquito in that so I called them today I complained all that they simply replied that they will look into my concern and will speak to hotel mAnasultangement I simply asked them for my money to be refunded then he threw 75 rs coupon as an lollypop for me to get convinced they are cheaper, cheater, frauds, lier's and useless fellow. They don't have proper satisfactory morals for their customer. I would like to request everyone not to use swiggy if you want to live healthy and strong. They use to take money they provides idiotic food even they don't treat their customer as valuable customer they treats us if we are fools. Instead of this I would recommend you all to.take direct number of restaurants or use zomato or similar app for online order.  For Further contact  My Email:- sonuchaudhary1964@gmail.com"
"Worst experience with swiggy in food delivery issue. The delivery of food by the delivery guy is appreciable, but the taste of food the swiggy provides is worst. The delivery guys spend their complete efforts to deliver the food but if we open the package and see the quality of food. ITS WORST THAN SHT"
"I Ordered Lunch at around 2 PM it comes to My Place at around 2  :45, When I opened that parcel it only contain Bhaji only, Chappti are missing, and when I raise the Request Swiggy Offering me Refund for chapati .  Should I supposed to eat only Bhaji?  And after 3 PM no restaurants are ready to delivery only Chapati only.  Now I do not Recommend any of my Colleague or Friend to Order again from Swiggy .  It would be Better to Order From Zomato or Uber eats."
"I have swiggy monthly subscription. Even then when i placed an order this time another 3 months subscription was added which when i said should not be added to my order, the order was cancelled and also my cod is blocked. When my subscription is on how can they offer me another one.  The customer care was pretty rude and unhelpful.  Faced a lotvof inconvience and a lot of time got wasted.  Some days back when my order was getting delayed they smartly called up so that they donot have to suffer.  Also there sould be some instant action provided to the customers when the app causes them problem.  For swiggy s mistake my order got cancelled and also my cod got blocked.  Feeling cheated.  I want compensation for my order, my cod revoked and also an option in the app for the customer to take action."
"Please don't go for swiggy. I suggest you go for something like uber eats or zomato. I received an order which was half eaten and when I contacted the customer care, they were least bothered about it and did not care to initiate a refund. I received it exactly 1.5 hrs after placing the order. They didn't care about my hunger too. The deliveries are also taking an average of 1 hour nowadays. Never expected this from swiggy!"
"The delivery guys are so rude, they don't speak to the customer properly while delivering. which is the least expected from the delivery apps. I haven't experienced service like this before from the other delivery companies. worst app. I am not going to order from swiggy again."
I ordered 2 veg burgers and 1 king french fries for which I paid 175rupees.  I got only 2 burgers as delivery and they didn't deliver french fries.When I contacted they simply credited 25 rupees in my account to use when I will order next time.  Bloody cheaters.This is the third time this has happend to me.They fool people by just crediting 25 rupees in their account instead of 175.
I have ordered prawns biryani from reddys paradise biryani. They have delivered the spoiled rice and uncooked prawns after waiting for hour. When i raised the concern to customer care they said they will take my feedback and pass it to the restaurant people. And no solution for us they siadindirectly to have this uncooked food and to spoil our health. After this repeated bad experience i am deactivating swiggy app and will never look back and will never suggest to anyone. Its waste of money and health.
"Swiggy cancelled my order because the food vendor was not able to reach me by phone.(However I have no missed calls. Don't even know why they were calling me in the first place.) They then charged me a Rs 200 cancellation fee. So, no food and I'm out Rs 200. That's a fine way to do business. Well done, Swiggy."
This app was giving more offers on ordetimeyd express delivery and selecting only quality restaurants for users health.This the fantastic food app ever I seen swiggy has live tracking facility also for users comfort and also delivers in on time.The offers given in swiggy were also fantstic and very useful compared to remaining food apps
"Swiggy has a very unprofessional service. I ordered roll from fasoos at 12 as my dinner. 20 mins after the order got confirmed I was informed that the item isn't available. I was asked to cancel the order.  A few minutes later I placed another order for a different item from the same restaurant. The order was confirmed. And the order was supposed to be delivered in 35 mins. It's been 2 hours now and the order has not yet arrived. Upon calling the delivery executive, he said that he got the wrong order and was going back to replace it. It was already 1 and a half hour since placing the order when he was going back to the restaurant to replace it.  The delivery executive name is aftaab and he wasn't listening to what I was saying. I'm not a Kannada speaking person and he was asking me to speak in Kannada. The way he was talking to me, it sounded like he was stoned and maybe uneducated cause he wasn't understanding a single thing I was saying. I patiently waited for my food for an hour and now it's been 2hours and I haven't received it yet. The delivery executive was near my location and I asked him to deliver me the wrong order since I was hungry and he kept on denying.  Contacting the customer support service. I was answered by KT_pritam. I never met an unprofessional person like him. I asked him to look into the matter and contact the delivery executive to deliver me my order since it was my dinner and all he was doing was asking me to cancel the order. I cancelled an order before this and it was almost 2:30 in the night and most of the restaurant's were closed. I asked him to understand my situation, that this order was my dinner and I wouldn't be able to order from anywhere else if i cancel it. And instead of helping me, he kept on asking me to cancel it. When I wasn't cancelling my order he asked me to understand his situation and then he stopped attending my issue.  As soon as this happened my delivery page showed that my order has been delivered and on raising this issue again I was asked the screenshot and after that nothing happened. No replies came.  The management of swiggy isn't professional. I being a customer was ill-treated. The customer support attendants stopped answering me, the delivery executive was making excuses and now it's 3 hours and the order still didn't reach me.  This is the worst platform to order food cause they won't care whether you've received your order or not or whether you're starving as long as they get the money."

I created an account with swiggy initially I received good quality of food but after my 3 to 4 order I found something wrong in that then I took help of swiggy customer care on chats and on calls as well. those guys are totally fake they did not provide me any solution  for that they only apologize. infact I ordered dosa today I raised a notification today to provide me bowl and spoon for sambhar but they didnt provide me anything and after delivery of food I call on swiggy customer care for this. they never provide me any solution.  worst experience with swiggy.
One of the irresponsible these people had made me wait for 1 hour showing the food tracking that the food was already picked from the restaurant. then they say lie that the item is spilled . the customers service executive is so hurry to cut the call and no proper reply regarding the inconvenience caused by them. go home you people are not for business or food delivery.
"This time I am having all the photos of fraud by swiggy and all chats and all call detais, I will post them all very soon. Today I have ordered from one resturant and they refused after 30 mins that one of the item is not there then I cancelled they deducted 200 as cancellation fee and I re-ordered from another resturant, what I found is there is no name of the resturant on the bill as well as packing and food Quality is too bad that wverything is on dustbin, when I raised that consern they replied will give feedback to resturant that’s it. how unprofessional behaviour it is ., stay tuned will be publishing all detais"
"Swiggy is extremely popular in Bangalore, where I live. They have a massive brand presence in this city, which is home to over 11.5 million people.They've achieved similar penetration in the Gurgaon market. India's food delivery sector is a $15 billion industry, and these guys are on their way to becoming one of the market leaders. They've also raised considerable funds to do this. ( source:   I feel that they've achieved more than enough notability to warrant a wiki page, and that you should leave this page undeleted."
"After ordering, their person called and said that hotel not taking order, so you have to cancel. When I cancelled, I was charged 200/-.  Customer care chat is so time taking and irritating. Not ready to listen.  Anyway realized that have been taken for a ride by Swiggy"
I have ordered pizza and paid the money but unfortunately dominos people were unable to deliver the order and now month passed away i am struggling to get my refund. Requested both swiggy and dominos and i only get excuses and refund is paid such answers but not giving transaction id and details.
I had ordred through swiggy...there was some items missing!!  Didnt get proper reply or compensation from swiggy. As per their replies i can understand...'its just a simple mistake'  It very shame to here like that...next as a customer i should think whether i need to order through swiggy or any other good services
Swiggy is one of the best app for food delivering and and hotels veiwing app  It has helped me several times when I order on swiggy it also gives us a 50 percent coupon on your first five orders so it also make it super cool I often use swiggy for food delivering it is the only app I use for food order so I recommend you to buy it
Yes I lov it. This ordering app. Swiggy app. Most important now. But it is most useful to order a any food. So easy  My friend also using this app. He is told me that about swiggy. ???? So many variety product are there. Lovely. It is easy to useful. I ever scene . Swiggy.??????????
Dear all  I want to share my personal experience  About swiggy a food delivery app  So on 31 march at night we orderd the pizza from swiggy app  From the menu we selected and orderd of two 8 inch pizza  But at the time of delivery we checked that  The restaurant has sent to small size pizza  It was aprox 5inch pizza  They just fooling us  And quality and taste was very worst
I had a very experience of ordering from Swiggys. You place an order and it will be delivered after 2 hours. Practically you stay hungry or order 1 day in prior. Worst service. On chats or phone customer care executive. are busy bluffing some other customers. They are in service industry but don't know how to service customers. If you face technical every second day pls shut down your company.
ORDER #38589932212 was delivered really late by 1 hrs. No proper response from swiggy as Swiggy got cash and no concern on customer hunger.  Swiggy if you want to sustain in market better respect the orders.If you cant please shut-down or close your APP.
"I had ordered lunch few days ago and this is my first time when I order food on swiggy and worst experience. I waited for 1 hour and then I called to customer care number . They told my food will deliver in few time, please wait for litter longer more and then Again I had to wait for 1 hour and 30 minute . When I called back to them . I was surprised to listen , they said ""we have not recived yoù r order for food ""And after checking the record they said that we had sent the food but you was not available to recieve That's why deliverer came back . In reality I had not received any call or message to take food . Their views were different at different time. When I said , return my money back they hung the phone"
"On 21 march I ordered my food from swiggy. I waited 1 hour but it didn't arrive then I called delivery executive but he didn't recieved the call. Then I called customer support but they said the restaurant is closed on that day so I asked why my order was recieved, they said they have technical issue and hung up my call. I had call again argue for my refund money as they were insisting on giving food coupon of that amount."
Swiggy.com it's an food delivery application so I had an birthday of my on 28th February so I ordered cake from apna sweets in Indore I had ordered it on at 1: 00 p.m. the told me that delivery will be placed on after 1 hour it means 2 p.m. but but at 2 p.m. I did not receive any food from swiggy so I call their customer service which is pathetic I don't think that such a big name and such of most pathetic customer service because they are not listening me properly and also they are giving me so many excuses of delayed of their delivery I must say they don't have any punctuality my friends are waiting for cake it's like that we are in so much fun and their service had made all it gone anyhow at 3: 00 p.m. I got the delivery that's Pizza but it's not in good quality I don't know why but and mostly the the man who delivered it his behaviour is so bad when I ask him that why are you late he told me dad do you know how far is this place from apna sweets I think what he is asking I know very well he is giving me foolish excuses about his delay and also the app take up 4 to 5 minute to be loaded completely no proper service did they provide ordering from swiggy is just like delaying our enjoyment that's it that the most pathetic experience from sweegy which I ever had after that I'd never order from swiggy at all they don't have manners and also the take more charges than and any other services I was really disappointed by their delayed  I also want to suggest you that they are much more better option than swiggy so don't you sweetie because you will never get your food on time.  Regards  Sawan molwa  9926590278
SWIGGY - BAD NEWS  Ordered 2 FRANKIES got a call saying delivery 45 kms away from present address which was put clearly . reason Given as my last delivery which was 6 months ago was at that address SWIGGY system had not updated.  Furthermore a charge of Rs. 90 being levied on me as their system did not update accordingly. Unaccepptable
"I am from a hostel present in Hyderabad. As food is not that good in hostel, I use to order on swiggy.but most of the times the food gets spilled. Skillful workers are needed for delivery.Coverage is very less. Need to improve more. Less no. of restaurants are available. Not up to mark. Not value for money all the times."
It is one of the favorite online store for food .it is fast delivery mode for food.it gives also good facility for food.you can easily purchase anything from this store.its amazing food store.it give also a high discount.it is one of favorite and most famous food store in my city.sp u should also try this.
15/04/2019 I ordered chicken biriyani and I paid 208 rupees through paytm but they delayed the person to assign to deliver after 45 minutes they assigned one person and after that I got message like order delivered I wonder I didn't get my order and I call to that executive but he not answering my call really I felt very bad how come this people will treat there customer if I paid money before coming only because we trust them but they are not trustworthy they will eat our amount not even good response from customer care as well and I will go to customer court  and I will suggest all don't use this food app they will cheat on you and don't pay the money before only  .  Really very unhappy about your service highly disgusting  refund my money or else I will file case against you.
I have ordered last 3 times by Swiggy and every time food quality was very bad. Swiggy is not delivery good food from proper restaurant. They do not delivering right order also. Many items are missing every time. Swiggy is not working properly and they are cheating with their customers.
Swiggy services are very very poor....Food is not same as given order....MAHA BAKWASH SWIGGY...I never order food again by swiggy....Pls close swiggy if you are not able to deliver food in proper way or time...........swiggy is MAHA GHATIYA..........
"I am really shocked to see the negative reviews written about Swiggy App which according to me is best App to order food at own place online.  What made me to like Swiggy App so this extent has been mentioned as follows-    The offers they provide you as soon one downloads and register in the App and makes their first order is really unmatchable with other Apps. Till date I have ordered food online from this App for nearly 25 times, everytime I am being provided an offer that makes the food cost reasonable to pay.     , 2. Swiggy never delivers you late, once I ordered at 12pm in Delhi, they delivered me but the delivering guy had no change to return me, he went a very long distance to bring the change and returned me. I feel more safe to use this App  3/ The quality of food they provide is delicious and hygienic because they tie up with only good restaurants having nice reputations. Specially order Biryanis form swiggy in Delhi, I swear you will love it.  4/ The varieties of foods of various culture are made available. From south Indian Dish to the North indian Dish, and extravagant Bengali Dish everything one can order and the prices are reasonable.  5/ Swiggy can be trusted. Once I ordered from another app, I made online payment also but they cancelled my order saying the payment has not been received. This things never has to be faced by the customers using swiggy App.  Lastly not the Least I strongly recommend all to use Swiggy App and take maximum advantage of the good service they provide. I will give 4 stars out of 5."
Something that saved my time and kept me healthy from past 3 years...lot of options and I really like the way you guys market..keep rocking and the delivery boys what swiggy has also very good. I have seen other delivery boys who have never been so decent.. They have lot of patience to give the food to exact location. My office is in 3rd floor no lift so only swiggy boys will deliver to the 3rd floor remaining will ask me to come down..i am totally happy with it
"We made 2 orders. One was incomplete. Even when we called behind the delivery man that this is incomplete, he did not return the money, nor did he bother to take action.  The second order had 2 milk shakes. He delivered only one. And when we checked and confronted, he had hidden on behind the door! Just imagine . what delivery boys they have!  After calling the customer care for a 1000 times, there was no refund, no explanation and a lot of distress. We were made to wait on the line for hours, without any solution. The order never came till the end, nor did the refund!"
"I ordered for mutton ""DRY FRY"" via Swiggy and I got something like mutton ""chilly"" that too with a bit of gravy in it. Pls, do learn the meaning of ""DRY"", especially when your customers using the swiggy won't be able to view the dishes. So please to provide the exact specification of the food that your apps gonna deliver, do not give us the fake info."
"The worst service ever! Being a so called ""Swiggy Super"" I placed an order with ID 38308174100. For that order they made me wait for about 90 minutes and then said me to cancel the order. They said they will give 40 extra credits for the ""inconvinence caused"" but soon I got a second call from swiggy saying my order can't be fulfilled so he too asked me to cancel and said I will be charged 40 cancellation charge instead. In the end I had to them multiple times only to waive off the charge"
"Half eaten food received, delivery executive was observed to be sitting idle at one place for a long time on the map during delivery.  Customer care executive was impolite and unhelpful too.  Their quality of service has declined over time.  Never going to order from them again."
"The so called best food delivery app swiggy is THE WORST APP. The can't make their customers happy. There basic consern is to make money not the customer base. Everytime I order something they deliver bad quality items. After showing concern they still don't show any interest and keep saying we will look further to your concern in your next order. So guys I recommend you to order your food, use ZOMATO app."
The delivery boy was pathetic and not interested in delivery and wanted we should go to half a km to take our delivery from him and when we refused he misbehaved and handed over pizza in worst condition which an animal will also not eat and it goes for Dominos too.I want an action on this .if u don’t want to work stop as will shut early with this kind of services.Swiggy owners do u read these reviews if yes then it’s really pathetic that u do not take action.everyone writing bad abt service and u don’t take action.I need my money back.
"Arrogant behaviour of delivery staff.Delivery staff said not to order from next time.we pay for the food.neither swiggy nor delivery boy is providing free food.whether they r providing services or doing a favour!!!!? Swiggy provides good services and good offers, but delivery staff should not be rude to customers"
Not delivered the ordered food properly.  Not delivered worth RS 50 food.  Giving coupon for RS 25.  Who is stoling RS 25 left.  Who's problem in this process  I placed order to get the food.  Not delivered properly & u are asking to take RS 25 back.  Please refer screen shot of swiggy customer care executive
"Swigy is one of the best food online site to order the food and enjoy the food. I Live in Hyderabad , Here , In Swiggy , each and every famous restuarant is being present in swiggy. Even at any corner , they come amd serve us . But., The thing is , Sonetimes the delivery charges are not so reasonable ! Their Surge taxes , Delivery charges are somewhat high. Only this particular thing , I dont like it. But they have many options for customers to order their own well wished dish ! Hmm , I Like swiggy aswell. I think , anybody can try this app , if you are not finding your well wished Food zone or any dish . But I Suggest swiggy that , Bring up new offers , So that people attracts your site aswell. Thankyou : )"
"I ordered food from CHULA Restaurant in pune , the order was veg handi and Naan . The vegetable was all rotten and very spicy, and the naan , pathetic... Half of the Naan was raw.. I threw the entire food in the dustbin , as I was afraid that even the animals might get affected with such food. I immediately raised my concern to the swiggy team .. Forget about solving the problem, the customer care executive dint even care to listen to the problem , and straight away said that we cannot refund the amount , and that is it... I was shocked to see this... I even asked them to collect the food back if they didn't believe but they were so hopeless , I felt so cheated... Never ever ever trust swiggy to solve your problems.. Instead they raise hands and sit quiet behind.  On the other hand , a similar situation had happened with me through UBER, but honestly speaking , I got my refund for that case. Plus they even apologized for the done mistake. Swiggy is a fraud company , and they know only to take people's money , and not give any solution , when a problem arises at customer's end."
"They took one and half hour after order to find restaurant is closed,  Then continued to assign different pickup executive, without knowing the restaurant is closed.  Finally sorry and will make refund....no value for our time."
"I ordered a chicken burger, coldrink, French fries, from burger King,  1These guys charge me for food packing, but it was not appropriate.  2-Driver who was carrying my food was rude and unprofessional and he kept my food in his personal bag instead of specific swiggy food cover,  3-The food was delivered post 1 hour now any one ac imagine the quality of food which I have received....  This time it was a a extremely poor service experience from swiggy..."
"Mine experience resulted with Swiggy.com has really been a bitter one and is as under.  1.This food delivery service delivers on its own convenience.  2.It is designed such that in case of any inconvenience, this company can leave the consumer empty handed without any responsibility.  3.They say, ""Consumer can cancel the order if it is not confirmed by restaurant"".The fact is that they lie as I tried to cancel my order when it took around one hour just to confirm my order and found that there is no way to do that.They have nothing for that in their app and their poor customer care service doesn't pick calls.  4.My time and money resulted in a wastage.Customers are really getting cheated with this food delivery service."
"My Colleague Ordered food for lunch - Chicken Biryani from The Decent Restaurant in Andheri West and guess what we found cockroach in my dish.  Really disappointed with this service, got my refund back from Swiggy but I won't recommend anyone to order or eat food from here.  The Decent Restaurant seriously guys pathetic service, won't even feel like giving a rating"
Its really sad when ur expecting ur food to be delivered quick but it takes up the whole time just to get a delivery guy assigned to pick up the freaking order please make sure further more delivery executives are there to reach the restaurant in time to pick up the order and deliver the food in lesser time
Swiggy.com is really an user friendly app. But some of the delivery guys are highly arrogant. Today's incident - For some reason the map picked up the wrong location and the delivery guy argued about it. He refused the delivery even if his location was less than 5 minutes away from the exact delivery location. Just imagine being famished and the food been so close to you yet get refused and you have to be hungry for next hour till another order is placed and delivered. Swiggy team needs to do something about such arrogance of the delivery guys. Just because of these few persons swiggy.com's name should not be hampered.
When I was calling the delivery man he just shouted out as with anger saying that he was too busy to attend me so I took it casually but when he came in front of me I saw his reckless attitude and was dissapointed to see that a delivery boy was that much rude . How can this be so. We are customers we pay for our service. So who are you to taje out your anger on us dude this was way too bad
I have order food from swiggy on 8th April 2019. the food quality was very third class not able to eat also. Its just waste of money. Please don't order from swiggy.I got the food which was different from my ordered items. Food appearance was very bad and its taste was worst.
Dear swiggy yesterday I have ordered the rolls fromgastronut porvorim which order was assigned to Tushar Ambekar contact number of staff 7378833055 so I said to him that if u get to find location call me I will guide you after 5 mins I m calling he is not receiving a call. Once he received he is misbehaving with me saying by wait wait I have another call and second time I call from my another number so saying me who is speaking I m trying to tell him so call disconnect after 5 mins I received a message your order has been cancelled even I am waiting for my order I have not cancelled I have order the amount 271 and they charged me 135 for cancellation charge even I have not cancelled so what a swiggy service .Staff behaviour is very bad.  You can check by order No- 37813229855  Call me for more clarification of this case.  Friends don't do online payment may be you will also get in trouble.
"Swiggy order no. 27692297139 food  No support from their side for issue.. Which was really not good...very much disappointed with their service, pls I personally think not to order in this app... They make you stay online for more time and say say sorry I can't do anything..."
"Beware you may loose your money like me. I place an order of Dominoes. Got a call that order is cancelled but swiggy order status shows delivered and I lost my money on pre paid order.  Also when I contacted switch, they said I need to contact Dominoes n they can't do anything in it."
I just liked their service.and their response is good.! They deliver fast and I have no issues.!  I just love the food quality.!  Thank you Swiggy.!  Waiting for more offers.and best services from you.!  I would suggest everyone to try swiggy once. because I feel it very useful.!  Thank you!
I was a regular customer of swiggy. From past one month me and few of my friends are experiencing very bad service from swiggy. Once the order confirmed again they will call after 30-40mnts and tell food is out of stock. Or if order is picked up also just for max 20 mnts delivery I had to wit more than an hour..
"I used to order alot from Swiggy and was my super favourite application. but its service has dropped big time now. I recently have experienced few cancellations from their resturants with no reason provided. Moreover, cancellation happened after 45-50 mins. The golden item is that I have paid via wallet and now I have no idea about the status of my amount. The Cx support is pathetic. You should have whole day to wait for their response. refer image. I don’t not what to do now. Swiggy team, it does not take much time to loose customers. Specially when there are many others in the same service. Really Disappointed !"
Ihave got the coupen code when purchased the swiggy super member ship (paid 140 ₹) I applied this coupen code when placed the order but delivery boy put status as delivered with out deliver the order .So I made the complain then swiggy refined my payment amount but not refund my coupen amount which I was applied .I call to customer care but they are not refunding my coupen amount even not adjusting in next order.so my personal experience is swiggy is very cheater and not have transparency in his system.
"Swiggy most of the times deliversincorrect order, swiggy doesn't refund money and to top it, swiggy executives abuse on call!!! If you talk to customer support, they say we will get a call back on the action taken , but, nobody calls.. nobody responds to the emails as well!! Nobody can beat the poor and pathetic services of swiggy. I spoke to the escalation manager Shyam, he said he would call back with action that has been taken but sadly, he never called back..the executives, managers- all are shameless"
Pretty good delivery service with proper packing and maintenance but swiggy should manage it time to deliver the customer  some great offers at available at great price discount . the behaviour of delivery worker is also very well due to their Hard words will achieve great success  and now final words is it is the best available food delivering app in Indian market
Where I live in Mumbai there is fast secure food delivery is provided by swiggy .there is great food at original price.And you don't have to give any type of tip for delivery boy.I have experienced great service at great prices and discounts. The delivery services are good . And there are great discounts you can found on their website
"I ordered a dish through swiggy using swiggy pop from ""Cafe Arabia"" a dish called Falafel with fries which looked like a roll wrap of falafel with fries, also by mistakenly I placed order to wrong address but even before my order was confirmed by restaurant I have quickly gone to swiggy chat and applied for cancellation, then I had a chat with support guy and requested to cancle my order soon but then he started asking me tons of question and in between the order got confirmed and it was started to prepare and the delivery boy got assigned, I requested them to plz change my delivery address they didn't do that also, it was very rude reply I got from there. Anyway my point is if I had raised a querry to cancle my order how come the app allowed to continue my order and start preparing it. the developer from swiggy seems purposely done that so to stole the money from customer. After all this when it got delivered to my other address I went there and checked, then food I order was completely different than what I saw in picture. These swiggy guys are a big theifs. I got two patties instead of roll and fries. Am so fked up by looking at the order and now I will never recommend swiggy and stop using it also."
"SO I landed on swiggy after seeing their add of 50% off so I ordered a dish from a nearby restaurant.  I added all the items on the card and applied the coupon the final cost that I had to pay was not very less as they added a lot of charges like deliver charges, restaurant charges and packing charges, the final discount I was getting was just of 20 rs on the price for what they usually sell for.  I still ordered the dish and the delivery was extremely slow. My food was delivered to me one hour later and I was sitting just calling the delivery guy as to where he was.  The taste was also not so good because the food had become cold and the oil and the masala was all solidified and tasted really bad.  Personally my experiences with swiggy was not so good as they dont offer any real time good discounts and also food does not tastes good as it is delivered to you so late.  I like going to the restaurant and eat warm food I also recommend you the same and dont waste your money thinking that swiggy provides you food at half prices which is not actually the case!"
"Yesterday I had ordered veg hakka noodles from swiggy for office team lunch party it was fully spoiled when we open the packet it was smelling so bad .no one had the noodles fully west, party got spoiled because of swiggy.so bad experience to ordering with swiggy .if anyone is planning to order from swiggy be carefull think once then order ."
I Have been a regular customer of swiggy over some time now but today I have recieved a disastrous behaviour and service from swiggy! If this review is helpful then I must say that swiggy delivery and customer care staff is poorest of all time. I clearly had mentioned my detail about the address but again and again he asked me that I mentioned the incorrect address. I asked him 100 times you have to com at Barakhambha Road but he refused to listen. Also he was just a KM Away and was unnecsarily misbehaving by saying that I dont have mentioned the correct address where as I had put Barakhambha on map and seperately mentioned the address. I mean if you have a confusion regarding the address please ask the customer before leaving the restauarant. They mis behave so badly with a woman that I literally threw my food. I will not order anything from swiggy because they are very rude and ill mannered as if they are doing a kind of gratitude to us while providing food. I have ahumble to request to all the swiggy people if delivering food is that a nuisance then stop your app your website its better to stay hungry than to order anything on swiggy. WORST FOOD DELIVERY WEBSITE IT SHOULD BE BLOCKED! PATHETIC SERVICE
"The food was ordered @ 1.40 PM and the same got delivered at 4.00 PM, pathetic services customer cares does not responses do not even tries to help to close the issue also.  After continuous follow up also no help received from customer care chat, .  The delivery boy was also not equipped to deliver food for 15 people."
I have recently ordered Dominos pizza using Swiggy and had an extremely disappointing experience where the food was delivered after 55 minutes and all I get is a sorry from an unappologetic staff. I had starving guests at home and to welcome them all I had was a sorry. Such a humiliating experience.  Shallow ticket resolution at the customer care end with Swiggy where all I get a blame game on dominos.  To top it all pizzas that I received were ice cold.
We have ordered food through swiggy. its good that we can track the rider . how far has he reached . they check that the food ordered by them is write or no . its good that this facilities helps one who is really tired and wants to order the food on line . mean while he can finish his rest of his work . gets enough time to rest . its very good for bachelors. or for a working lady . if her day was very busy .
I am a regular user of swiggy.but their customer care service is horrible.  First of all they will never understand your problem.and you will get one reply in 5 minutes.their response is very very slow.and if you delay in replying they will close the chat window without resoving your problem.  last night it took 90 minutes before they culd understand my problem and resolve it.most of the contact details mentioned on swiggy are wrong.if yu try to contact the restaurant you will never get an answer
I have ordered food from swiggy several times and they have not disappointed me yet.The orders were delivered within 30minutes.Foods that were ordered were in perfect condition there was no damage in packaging.I was offered several of my nearby renowned resturants by swiggy which gave me a good variety to choose from.The delivery boys were also decent in behaviour and swift in their delivery.To sum up I can say that my experience with swiggy so far has been very satisfying.I am hoping they continue to give such good services.pls kindly like my review if you think it is worth it
"I often order the food on SWIGGY and the best part is delivery because it is really fast. Within 20-40 minutes of time you order will reach your doorstep. The delivery boy is really humble . Then comes food, so the food is really great. I like the packing of the food. It is very hygienic. And the food what you order comes from Your nearby hotel or Restaurant what you have chosen while the order. So I would like to give it 5 stars. Thank you."
"Experienced back to back cancelled orders from swiggy. You cannot call customer support in the event of failed requests. Another surprising fact of terrible swiggy services is that you cannot apply the same coupon codes if the transaction gets cancelled. Unfortunately, you will have to control your hunger for two hours to use the same coupon again. I don't know who's the policymaker for swiggy, but whoever it is, has gone nuts."
My order was cancelled on 19/03/2019 still my refund is pending swiggy not respinding they just kept my money.They are saying to talk with dominos and dominos said they refunded amount to swiggy Worst customer support never placed order through swiggy.
No sooner did ny youtube channel is open and vedio is started the first five second advertisement that I get is of this application. They've promoted their app in a very good way leaving the example to ve followed by others. They have gained a very good successes and have been accoladed by many people for their said-done stuff.  Service and support of this app is up to the mark which has not only liked by me but also has been liked by my friend who orded first time online and chose to do so through this app.  They provide very depth informations to their customers as they might be knowing that customers are the king and we are the servnet. If it gets annoyed then our business in very near to loss.  Content of this app is very good if I'm to add a little more to my review then I would like you to downlaod this app to your mobile phones  Time to load problem had been resolved with adding new feature allows us to surf it without using 4g connection as it can be used when we are ran out of our daily quota.
"I love Swiggy as they delivered food on time . They always deliver a proper fresh, hygiene , healthier and tastier food with proper packing. I ordered food every week, till now I have not seen any food related issues. believe me. One can even call them and can ask how much time it will take to deliver our food and can ask for to deliver fresh food.  Sometimes issue occurs about the cancelled orders but the money always be refunded by them on time. So for this situation one needs not to be Panik and Angry but can reorder whatever they want. So, I believe that it is safe."

"I order the food 20mins back and he came with the order saying that the he didn't know the address and he is charging me extra 50rps for petrol where as i always order the food with same address, and when i said that i will talk to your agent he said call i dont care and left off, as soon as i called mistakenly i called his numbr he came back and said he went for the change and started arguing with me, i was scared with his behaviour so i closed the door and he banged my door and left."
This website is really awesome to buy foods and beverages online. Such a good site. Highly recommended for all. Gud experience. Good place for all food buying. It has many promo codes with many offers. Very fast delivery amd excellent service by owner and as well as delivery man. Superb place. Must appreciate
"By mistake I have ordered 03 times from Swiggy but always waiting for 90-120 minutes for food delivery, Swiggy is worst in Food delivery. I will not suggest to use Swiggy, waiting for food for more than 01 hour, Swiggy will kill by keeping there customer hungry and there customer service dont bother at all. They forget swiggy is for us, Customer is not for swiggy."
"This app is very good as compared to other online food delivery app. On swiggy present all restaurent. It's customer friendly. In any problems , customer support are there. It's offer are good. But in swiggy , location are not better it's good. Swiggy offer much more cashback. In swiggy , good thing is pop up. It's very low prive and fastest delivery. Swiggy offered restaurent offer. In all other restaurent have differen offer. It's very useful. In my opinion it great.  Thank you ."
"I had ordered food through Swiggy to BROTHERS BRAND restaurant at vastrapur Ahmedabad. Even after mentioning special instruction like less spicy, the same was not followed. And when contacted the restaurant the manager & owner behaved like goons, as if I had made a mistake by ordering. When I had ordered two items, how can they replace only one? And than they shout on me that I can do whatever I want. And then they didn’t even replace one item. Worst experience on swiggy. And calling swiggy was another nightmare, as swigggy person refused to refund money for my spoilt food and just said sorry! Is this what is expected! And I urge people not to visit place like BROTHERS BRAND. Pathetic food and cheater administration."
I ordered food two times from swiggy app and trust me the service of swiggy is on the time and very best . They talk in a proper way with there customers. When I ordered most of my friends told me that no its service is late and not on the time try other app for food delivering but I tried and then my friends also liked that its service is on time. We enjoyed a party . Swiggy I must tell you that yoir sevice is best and outstanding keep it up man. I never saw this fast food service in my life time when I booked dominos they also reached late but swiggy on time. I shall always book my food kn swiggy. I suggest everyone that swiggy is the best.
"Impeccable service, needs to work a bit on the app. But deservingly the best start up in India.  Needs to be a bit careful on the payment methods provided. Like, PhonePe and other UPI, sometimes the payment get stuck but apart from that you get refund instantly, which writes off the other payment issues. But being a number one start up in India they need to be a bit careful on that part."
Any body is from indore I genuenly tell to every one that the delivery and custumer service of swiggy is so worst it was 18 march 2019 when I ordered an cake from apna sweets they tell me that delivery will be proced within 30 minutes I waited and than I call to custumer service that yet delivery is not held they rell it will procid in 15 minutes due to some reason and when after 15 minutes I contact them than they tell me that the reasturant has been closed they have wasted my 1 hour really their service is so bad
Hunger quencher especially on lazy weekends .no words to thank swiggy for their tireless and punctual service: ) just by a click swiggy will be there with the yummy delicacies.great service for busy people especially in metros .when there is no time to cook the only option that comes to our mind is your name.my dear swiggy .swiggy mantra throughout
"1.DETAILS  It is a very good app to use and anything would be delivered under 30 minutes    DELIVERY BOYS     Some people are very good some people are very bad, mainly based on their nature  3.FUNCTIONING  It is a food delivery app which delivers food to doorstep inder 30mnts Due to this many people are getting jobs  4.OFFERS  The main negative thing is the offer they are providing because if we apply coupon to order the food the size of the food is decreased whereas in common the portion of the food size is good  In this way they are making gimmick    OPTIONS     We can order from almost all the restaurants available in the city  6.IMPROVEMENTS  The place where they want to improve is thwir map accuracy sometimes it shows the wrong address which makes lot of confusion"
"Team, when i look for restaurants on the web its says available but when once I ordered a food delivery boy says they don't deliver the food to my location. Please you should not show the restaurant at first place now I've no one to help. Not fair team:("
"Disgusting experience regarding refund and delivery...shamefully they made me wait for my order for 2 hours .. they did not bother to inform me before cancellation, they did not refund my money on immediate bases plus no coupon on there fault, most pathetic food service app ever"
My transaction got failed and I paid twice but they never refund your money or even respond properly  Everytime they say different reasons for it  Finally I was asked to check with my bank but I need a proof mail for confirming the order failure but this swiggy support doesn't send that even.  Customer service is worst  ---------  Am not sure if someone from swiggy team read and understood my frustrations  I got a call 5 days back and my money got credited  Truth and hard earned money stays
I m never going to wright any negetiv feedback coz I had exillent experience with swiggy thet is didn't matter we faced issue some time with our delivery atlest we need to understand thet its digitally platefrom human have a common sance who can understand thet I allwys ignored some problem if I faced any issue about delivery but I want to say swiggy is trusted platform we can trust swiggy just want to share some word thet I faced some issue with my oder thet sloved today I really very thankfull the people who helped me extremely really appreciate coustmer support executive she is/Ms priyanka I don't know wich one office have she contacted with me but she is brilliant she have a lot of knowledge how to handle coustmer kindly appreciate to Ms RM_ priyanka John wish you all the best your success don't break our faith Thanks. ?? ?? ??  Best regards  Naresh kumar?
They are providing very worst service ..whenever I ordered something I always get a wrong order and after complaining they didn't listen carefully and they didn't refund the amount..improve your self otherwise close your app instead of fooling people
"This application is for buying food items online  The service of this app is very good  In this app we can order our food from different restaurants / cafe any time we want to.  This application is very easy to use.  Just select the restaurant/cafe and the food you want to order and book the order. its just that simple  And the app a big plus point too  You can pay for your food in multipe payment methods through net banking or debit card or cash on delivery.  The orders gets ready not more than 10 minutes. It is very helpful at times of get-togethers , house warming parties, etc.  And you can cancel your order if you want to within 10-15 minutes of order getting booked through service chats and service calls  There is no issue of costumer service department, they quickly react to what we raise.  I love this application. Its my life savoir."
When swiggy recently started the offer of 60% off I started using swiggy And I was astonished to see that how can any platform provide you food from top restaurants at 60% off that too at your home without you moving a step out.  I have ordered food for more than 5000 rs on swiggy and I have not faced any complaint yet.  Yes the food such as dosa or such dishes meant to be served hot give a bit of drawback to delivery platform but otherwise most food items are delivered properly and tastes really good.  I usually order ice creams or sweets at such great discounts and eat them with the whole family.  I have even ordered such things that I wanted to eat but could not eat because how overly priced they were now at 60% off they became economical and I could enjoy them at my home.  Overall I would like to thank swiggy to give such great discounts and so fast delivery that we could try so many dishes of so many restaurants.  I surely recommend using swiggy as the discounts they give save a lot of your money  THEY EVEN GIVE 10% CASHBACK WHEN YOU PAY USING AMAZON PAY WHICH IS ANOTHER GREAT THING.
"I once ordered pav bhaji which is veg dish because I'm a vegetarian and instead I got chicken tikka, I asker the delivery guy and he said that pav bhaji wasn't available. Even if it wasn't available the delivery boy has no right to change the order or buy something completely else. Very disappointed.????????"
"I am a regular customer of swiggy, fond of delicious food my family always try to order from hotels.n swiggy is the best option to get food quickly with full order tracking.good service .many offers and promocodes make us to get our food in discounted price.servicemen are very co operative with full hard work"
". This is best app ever. Just coz of swiggy we can afford costly food. release keep you discount and promos so we enjoy your service for lifetime one of best discount offer is SWIGGY. Better discount than other apps. Customer care is quick and good. Supports upi payments. delivery in 30 mint also very polite.  . Pay instantly using VISA/MasterCard credit or debit net banking payment can also be done at the time of delivery using cash.  . Want tasty , affordable, and doorstep meals, delivery right at your doorstep? Get swigging install the swiggy app now and order food online from swiggy in agra"
I have ordered biryani at 2:44pm yet not received my order 4 delivery boys has been changed and 1st delivery boy has called and said my tyer has been punchared and plz cancel the order and re book the order then we asked its not our problem and yet now not received the order
I am not much into these online platforms to order food. I usually directly call the restaurant to get my food.  But recently for 2-3 orders I used swiggy as they offer 50% discount and I hought it to be a good deal.  So I placed an order of malai chap and some other stuff from a nearby restaurant just 15 mins away from my house.  and the swiggy representative took 2 hours to deliver the order.  also they charged 50 rs as taxes and delivery fee so in my overall I could just save 10 rs.  Hence their 50% off is just a trap to get orders.  When I received my food it was all cold and all the oil and masala was dripping out of the packaging. The chap of the restaurant is very tasty but because of delayed service all the food was spoiled.  And the biggest irritation is the costumer care people dont pick up the calls they add your call in ques and lets you wait for minutes before addressing your issue.  Overall my experience with swiggy has been really bad and I prefer directly calling up the restaurant for delivery or going to the restaurant for eating my food  I hope the review was useful  THANK YOU
Getting worst day by day willw never use this swiggy app again n suggest u all not to  Poor customer care service  Charge you for their mistakes  Delay in deliveries  Unprofessional delivery boys  Not at all satisfying  Seriously worst experience ????????
"So after all the youtube hola pola about tampered food parcels. I finally received a swiggy parcel with tampered or half eaten food. the restaurant in question Karims Versova refused to take responsibility and categorically said its a swiggy issue and use Zomato. The irony of the situation is that he had already guessed it was a swiggy order. I am wondering why is only swiggy guys delivering tampered food packages? So I had a cleverly tampered food package where pieces were ripped off so the piece count remains the same. Since I am a regular with the restaurant I knew someone had eaten from my parcel. Now I am wondering if I order one gulab jamun will someone eat half of it? Also, the parcel reached late .now we know why. So swiggy delivers cold leftovers from their delivery team while you foot the bill."
Swiggy is a good food delivery app. There are many offers in this app. But the restaurants are very limited in this. The time taken for delivery is not good enough. The packaging of food is also very good. There will be more goodness if the numbers of restaurants increase in the app. The app is on of the trending app for food delivery.
I like to eat. And this time swiggy helps me to tests deferent types of food. I order food from swiggy every week. Their food quality are delicious. They deliver our order proper time.  Their deliver boy behaves good with us. And they want to know how was their food quality and asks for feedback. I am realy thankfull with swiggy. Thank you.
"You will get all types of food from your favorite restaurant and very fast  Foods are awesome, very delicious in very less price. The food is delivered very fast at your door  Just love this app. THANKS SWIGGY  only think I dislike is that food packaging is not good enough it need to be inprove  AWESOME APP  recommended to others  Considering the product  Best app for online food delivery you can get food of your relgion and choices.  Just use this app and enjoy your meal at home  I can get the food of my choice at anytime at my door. It saves my time for searching restaurant outside"
I have ordered food they have not delivered it and i contacted customer support executive .he is trying to convence me telling it will reach in another 15 mine and all. and later after waiting for soo long i canceled the order .very bad service by swiggy .
"Through this app I call order for online without going anywhere else and plus whenever you are tired, you do not wanna make food then just swiggy it up this site better than other site  It's is also user friendly and the customer service is also great you can use Swiggy at almost any location and the delivery is quite fast and customer service is great"
"To all property consultant & owners beware of Swiggy's while giving your property on lease to Swiggy for their kitchen purpose as the company is big fraud specially the property management team.    The property management team is a big fraud for asking commission to sanction your property on lease.    They have all fake head office phone numbers, address or email ids mentioned their websites if your want to complaint about anything    The best example is that company Mumbai Sakinaka head office employees including the the reception itself doesn't have any idea about any of their own department boardline number for any inquires or complaints."
Neither track order feature is working nor the phone is reachable.extremely pathetic service. swiggy sucks. not even bothered to cancel the order even for undelivered order. More than one hour and still no update on the order.swiggy stop online delivery if you guys are not even bothered about this
"Pathetic customer care services offered by Swiggy, I was busy somewhere and ordered food for my kids, surprisingly I got a SMS that Food had been delivered but I cross checked it was not delivered, I used chat services they confirmed to redelivered but even than not delivered after that I am chasing them for my refund but they least bothered and today is 3rd day I have still not received by money back . My suggestion use there cash on delivery otherwise they"
Swiggy listed small to large all type of restaurants and we can choose our favourite restaurants and order food online with Swiggy very easily and we can get our food deliver at our office door within 30 to 40 minutes.Food deliver by restaurants is also good with seal pack.Swiggy provide realtime gps map for track deliver boy.We can get notification when deliver boy pick order and on the way to deliver order.Swiggy provide many different types of options for pay bill we can pay online or we can also pay bill to delivery boy with cash on delivery option.
"The delivery service has really gone down the drain. Just see how the food was delivered today. This is after 2 hours of delivery time. 2 days ago also same thing happened. When asked to refund the amount paid for super membership as the quality was not upto mark, they said it is against their policy to refund. It seems their growth has really gone to their head and now they dont care about the customer anymore. It is high time they introspect into their service and decide if customers are important."
One of the worst experiencei felt with swiggy  Ordering for the first time delay almost 45 minutes ..debited my money in the last they canceled my order .and they are explaining me restaurant is not ready to prepare my order bcoz they have not receive any bill .the said we will cancel my order you will receive your money back almost24 hrs .then why the hell you accepted my order and pls dont suggest such a bad restaurant in the list .i think zomato is far far better than you  Never ever going to place any order with you guys in future .
We were away from home and craving good vegetarian food so found this awesome place Navtara veg restaurant Panjim Goa.Had an amazing experience while dining in at Navtara Panjim Goa yummy food great service and very positive attitude five stars from my side my family loved it
My food was delivered within the given time as mentioned.Food was also nice.The app works smoothly and very user-friendly.  There are many restaurants available for food delivery. Price rates are also normal and within budget.  I liked the service.I also used coupon code which saves my money too.  Thank you
"The restaurants they listed in the app, those are very poor quality. And not able to track the delivery person if we have any issues. Worst customer support and services. Very very disappointed that the service they have given. I'll suggest people don't use swiggy app."
Waste app... Waste waste waste waste. I am ordering biryani . That is chicken or dog also. Waste. Road side food. Customer care executive rashed .. waste app.. waste money.. total company waste... I loss my money.. road side food delivered. Waste app..
"I have been using their delivery on some emergency days. I have found that the delivery persons are good. But the food that is delivered is deplorable. The food is never adapted though there is an option on the app for the same. Heights of the experience was the rotis would be uncooked, rice would be grainy, oil floating on the gravies. What kind of restaurants are you associated with? We don't want food from some third rate hotel. Iam uninstalling their app."
So yummy food.it is a.best.app.i like this.app.and. service.ise.very.good.and.food delivery.is.very.fast.and. one of the good thing. food available in low cost .and affordable price.swiggy is pop very easy to know.you can.track.the. delivery.via. Google.map .then.i like.swiggy
I'm swiggy customer of past six months I'm not satisfied with this one they again and again mistaked wrong items and they food are very bad quality and I complained to the customer service they not support to me they are arguing with me I'm very disappointed I already complain in this same problem but they not responding.... And the delivery executive are very bad attitude irresponsible fellows they are not convenient to delivery and they bloody f... Attitude some executive are very again and again mistake the same problem
Worst customer support poor management unprofessional service. very important worst quality food delivery by swiggy.. I have been ordering food from swiggy for some month at first it was Okay but Now whenever I order something there comes lots of problems. worst delivery boy also
Today i had ordered food from swiggy and the taste of the food was such disgusting that i couldn't even imagine. Bt the food itself was denotes as Best Seller on the site of the shop bt it is the worst thing that I have ordered till now from swiggy. Didn't expect this type of quality.
"The worst app, never care about customers.No care about wrong item/ not delivered orders. Just give fake promises for compensation. They want mint money. Talk about zero tolerance and future assures but they are zero for our money lost against fraud suppliers. They do not respond on time. Lately put messages with compensation on chat you never known about it. They do not care about our numerous complaints by saying no response from our side. Look my screen shot they never credit the offered coupon for not delivered ordered item."
Placed an order at 10.30 pm and get a call form swiggy customer support at 1135 pm that the order is canceled. The agent could hardly converse in English and addresses me as ching wah. That's the name of the restaurant I had actually ordered for. Pls put the money to better use that you guys just received as funding and but the way I am a swiggy super user and have been using swiggy from the month it was launched. Even before that app was developed.
"From last few days, I had worst experience from ordering food from swiggy as they don't deliver the food on proper address and when you call them to deliver it on the proper address they will ask you to pick up the food from somewhere and it normally happens when you make online payment. Therefore, I request all of you who all are reading this feedback, please stop making online payment and if possible start using other App because now a days swiggy became worst."
The service is bad and plz dont use it as the delivery executive and customer care is very arrogant... I am very disappointed with the service and quality.. Plz shut down ur website if u can satisfy your customers... Also kindly let me know whr i can complain about it
This is the one of the greatest app to get the food delivered on time and the quality of the food is also outstanding.  My opinion for the app is really tremendous. I ordered food from SWIGGY many times and got best service. I also ordered food from other food delivery apps but the experience with this app is on the top of the list.  the most important thing and the best thing of the app is that the way of operating the app is very simple and easy. Everyone can order from this app by just clicking on the hotel or restaurant and then after we will get the menu of the products those they deliver to the customers and by clicking on the products we can place the order and as I mentioned earlier the service and the delivery time is also very quick.  Zomato app is hard to operate and they also have less discount and offers as compare to SWIGGY.  Swiggy is also offering 50% discount on first 5 orders.  So my recommendation is to download the app and enjoy.  Love you SWIGGY!
BCH. YOU SLEEP DAILY WITH YOUR BOSS AND HAVE VGA WIDE OPENED LIKE A TUNNEL. You do not know to process the refund or even to re order the food. You think you can do whatever you want. You dirty HOE we all know what you do. But after ordering the food at 3 am when you get the spilled order you do this
3 am and I was really hungry and could not make any food.ordered food in zomato and it arrived in just 30 min at that part of the night.  The delivery person was really good and kind enough to deliver the food right on time and also it was delivered to door step.  I really appreciate the swiggy service for good quality food and great delivery service.  The food was hot and yummy.!
"Hii  I oredered on swiggy at 06-02-2019 as basically because I ordered food every time or twice a week on swiggy but this time the service is so bad.  I ordered white sauce pasta and egg biryani on swiggy by paytm payment but after the couple of hours of ordering I talked with customer care of swiggy but they did not took any type of response on my order and I also talk with that delivery boy, he recieved my call and when I asked about my order he just cut my call. I also call in that restaurant from were I ordered food but they said your ordered was delivered and swiggy's customer said your order was coming shortly but my delivery was not came. My money was also not returned by swiggy."
Very poor service delivery executive switched off their phone  Kala dhaba not picking call  Waiting from too long and at last I have to cancel the order..  Not recommended to use very very poor service please if you want to maintain your position so please strictly manage your delivery executive
According to my personal experience when you order any food on swiggy.com. so it is a causes of waste of money . you gain weight because it is restaurant and fast food. The food might not be hot as you expect. Fast food create many disease like acidity and heart problem. So I personally suggest that homemade food is better.  I Think it is helpful.  Thank you
Swiggy.com is the best food aap I always order food from Swiggy.com it's ordering process is very simple and easy and it's give many other offers and discounts for avery order and simple to cancel orders as you can please try it and belive the Swiggy.com it's my and my all friends favourite food app  Thanks
"I am ordering through swiggy from last 1 week regularly and every time I have ordered one or the other things are missing. if items are not possible to deliver or provide by restaurants, then it should not be written and if written and not provided then compensation must be given. we are not paying full amount to get half items from the service providers.our money is precious too. also, there are various coupons given in the apply coupons but they are not applicable from the android mobile application, as they are not developed. then why you are showing them. they provide in good delivery time, but address has to be explain no. of times to delivery person which is annoying. Lot of improvement required in service."
They do not believe in customer satisfaction at all. All that matters to them is money and their research on new ways to cheat people. Sometimes you will get wrong food... sometimes it is delivered dead cold which is supposed to be hot... sometimes it has melted into liquid form when it suppose to be cold...and when you as a customer complain...they do not even give your money back!...  I am following up for my money since almost a month now...not only have I not got my refund...they aren't even responding to my mails...  They are worse!...ZOMATO IS 1000 TIMES BETTER?!!  If I had a chance for giving negative stars...I would have done that!...you don't even deserve a single star!...
They should close down Swiggy...It is not a working model.The delievery is pathetic and the response is worse..the jaipur market is fed up with Swiggy ...the people working in Swiggy are unprofessional and unhelpful..the people at swiggy needs more training here at Jaipur
I have ordered curd rice and was expecting the order to be delivered at door. I called the delivery boy and told him about the address.at that time he was aware of the address but after 10 min he again called and said that he dosent know the address. I directed him over a phone call but he couldnt find it. I even asked him to give the call to somebody else so that I can explain this to him. he denied and cut the call. I called again and he asked me to come to other direction which was around 10 min far from my house or else I will have to cancel the order. I even went out to reach him out but couldnt find. At last he rudely said that come out and take your order or else cancel it I am not coming.  I really felt so bad that why these people do a delivery job if he doesnt know how to access the map.  The person's name was Arjun Kalyanrao Jogdand. And because he cancelled the order. I got charged by Rs. 109 on my next order.  Thankyou Swiggy for ruinning my day.
"I was wrongly charged cancellation fee.. They only asked me to cancel the order for some GPS problem which the delivery agent faced.. When I contacted the customer care, they were not clear about what to do next.. The only thing they told me 10 times is to cancel the order..Trust me Zomato is 10 times better in service delivery and customer support"
"Swiggy is the best food delivery servives round the globe in my opinionm . But in India, its service is poor, it is greatly affected dye to the quality of their food and theur delivery personals. They don't respect others. They just deliver food ask for money rudely n go . Food is better but service is not."
It's the only app I love because am living in trivandrum in kerala there is no other sites can't come to my area and the only site is come to my area is swigvy the amazing factor about is swiggy cover all the area and take the order and ordered so many items in it and its so fast and cool and I love to use swiggy app also the delivery man have patients and good quality in talking
I ordered food on swiggy today and it took more than 30 mins to get the confirmation of the order. After almost an hour I got a call from the delivery boy who was very arrogant who was right in front of my office building and was reluctant to come because he said the address was mentioned wrong. He was shouting at me and told me to cancel the order. I did not cancel the order but I got a message from swiggy saying your order was delivered. I tried their chat option but it was taking almost 5 mins for them to respond. I tried to respond to their mail asking my feedback but it was not possible .neither was the executive able to convince me and said in future we will give you excellent service . We need to have some mechanism to sue these people for making just wait for long time and then denying their service at their interest. Swiggy has once again disappointed me.
"Recently due to lack of time, I had to order an anniversary cake online and I thought to choose Swiggy this time as an option. I must the say, the real time tracking system was awesome! It was almost indeed a great experience and the delivery was pretty quick.  My experience was smooth and since I ordered from a known vendor, I was assured as to what I will get.  Rating: 4/5 based on my experience"
I ordered 2 burgers at 12.39pm and not yet received my order. Now the time is 5.27 pm. I already paid complete amount. I am swiggy super customer. Is this the service you giving to super subscription customers? Guys do you really need 6 hours to deliver 2 burgers? Have you guys gone mad? No proper response from any of your customer service representative. You guys are unfit to run business. Learn from Uber eats about quick delivery. And teach some manners to your customer care agents.
"I placed my order at Triptify Online Parantha Kitchen in Madhapur, Hyderabad on 24th of February 2019.  My first order was canceled but the payment got debited from my account shown in the image below. I had to repay the amount for confirming the order. It has been 12 days since I placed my order hoping for the refund in my bank account but I presume some presence of fraudulence in the gateway. The chatting person told that there is a problem in my bank account but I found from the bank that nothing has been received at their end regarding this refund. Nothing has been initiated from Swiggy's end and falsely claims of refunding the amount. I have been chatting with the chatting service(Soumyadeep Sengupta and Afreen Atique) but was in vain. They closed the conversation before catering to the need of the customer. Worst experience ever ordering food from swiggy."
"The overall service we get tilll date with Swiggy is preety good most of times but there are few flaws with their system which must be corrected.  One time I ordered something from nearest restaurant and guess what? They were taking unnecessarily too much time, I can see their vehicle picked up the food from the restaurant but the route he took was very long, a delivery man delivering somehwre else got my order and I could see that he can't reach on time and even then when I tried to contact them they said to wait it will be delivered soon, so somehow they ignored the fact that its 2 wheeler only and not a flight. So at last I had to cancel the order and we were really hungry so felt very bad. That's why we rarely use these apps to order, better to go their and get real hot food instead of getting cold and late delivery for few discount and not that great service.  Still the business is overall good but they need to improve from ground level understanding what customers want and they must take some immediate actions for such cases where customers are getting late delivery and cold food and wrong items etc."
I ordered from Swiggy and the order was cancelled from their end due to their inefficiency and inability. Delivery company as claimed which cannot deliver and leaves you high and dry! And to top that they are informing me that I will be charged 96 Rs penalty on next order. THIS IS FOR INCONVENIENCE THAT THEY CAUSE YOU BECAUSE OF THEIR INEFFICIENCY
"Swiggy Food app is very very GOOD  SWIGGY is the first Indian app for food delivery. So Many offer are available for any time. Special VEG /or NO VEG, food available Quick delivery in your home. I use this app for last 2yr, and I am so happy to it.  The delivery boy and his Sarvice good.  Food parcel or packing nice.  Payment options - you can pay online or cash on delivery both operation available.  Letest 50% off offer in first five order in all food. I am so enjoy the app and offer. Thanks swiggy."
I think my description Title only says the entire feeling that I have about this food delivery portal or website.  Swiggy has always been the last choice for me considering that they are always focused on buying customers through office and providing discounts.  Their customer care response has always been poor and pathetic.
"So I am here giving review about swiggy food ordering app. I think that this all websites are nonsense wasting time not only swiggy but other food ordering app's like Foodpanda, Zomato, Uber eats etc. all are not reaching the expectations.  This type of app's have not reached any small cities and also in big cities the food we have ordered comes very late and they are also charging a lot amount for packages of food which I have read in many other reviews. I have tried every food ordering app's but they have still not reached our area.  I think that they should improve their service and place orders of rural areas too. I understand that their facilities are not upto expectations but sometimes in do or die situations their order can help us. Those who thiks that their services should be improved support me and like my review. I am reviewing this app after the difficulties I have faced from this app. I hope it may help you. Thank You"
"Nice app, timely delivery, I ordered for cake for my mom dad anniversary within 15 mins the cake was delivered to my door step.and I ordered food and cake for my anniversary also they were really quick.and the delivery man was very polite.and the food item was nicely packed so I would give 100 points for the app"
"Swiggy keeps on exaggerating bills. When I caught this Swiggy initially said they would refund the difference of amount. But now Swiggy even after 4 months from date of complain is still exaggerating bills and denying to refund any extra amount.  Examples of pictures attached. Resturant hasn't charged for packaging and items are inclusive of GST but Swiggy has included packaging and GST extra.  Selling products above MRP like Pepsi bottles are priced at Rs45 which has MRP of 35 and when I asked for bill along with proper GST number, Swiggy didn't respond to my request."
"I have had multiple instances with swiggy where the prepaid orders are either delayed or have missing items. Once the delivery executive even refused to come up to the door and asked me to come downstairs to collect it. COD however is always delivered properly. They don't even have a customer care where you can call, you can only chat and that too has a 10 min wait time. Way to loot people!"
I placed tomorrow N I will not lie The food was really good But the delivery Boy Still Messaging me On what's app N irritating he wanted to talk to me So From Now i really don't wanna Order anything from swiggy want Other girls should Also Try to avoid swiggy because it's Harassment ????????????????????
Swiggy is one of the best food order app available in India.  I have used other food apps but zomato is best among them.  I usually order food from Swiggy and I always suggest others to use Swiggy which is best.  Customer service is best but they take too much time in delivery but not always but sometimes.  Swiggy you will most cheaper to expensive which shows that it has lots of option.  So kindly use Swiggy which is best food search engine app.
"The online food delivery are becoming in trend now a days. Swiggy is one of the best online food delivery in india. The service of this site is very good, the food is come untill 20 to 30 min according to distance. The maximum restaurent are available for food in swiggy they are not charging you more for the delivery of food but they available that at low cost. So if you want to order the food open the swiggy."
I am on love with this product. when I placed the order first time I thought that it will be bad but it was very very very nice I love this you should also prefer this website this is very nice . I am very very happy with the website you should also be for this website.Ithought first time the delivery will be too late but it was gast amd feurious  please preffer this only Im in love with this service
This is actually the leading app in it's category. Best quality handling of food. The attitude of the delivery boy is also very good. Very polite and respectful. The time estimated is also genuine and it reaches earlier than the estimated time. I've often ordered food from my favorite places at any time of the day. It's perfect.
Bakvas response and they said money refund in 24 hours but now after three days not refund money nobody trust on swiggy i not recommended anyone to swigg zomato is best for that never trust on swiggy. I call on swiggy and also chat with swiggy executive but still they are not responding
Very bad experience from swiggy today I order a pizza from swiggy very bad quality and smelling pizza of that pizza and when I request a swiggy to solve my issue swiggy company denie to solve my issue. Its my first and very bad experience with swiggy. And its a wastage of money to order from swiggy
"This is the food delivery service situated in the metro cities as like Pune, Bangalore, Culcutta, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bombay, etc so we didn't have to be worry about it. While I was in Poona My brother's son has demanded Pizza from them .They have not given order properly. Reached too late after some guestshave been gone. After all we saw is it pizza nice but Pizza also very worst. It was stale pizza having fowl smell .Then my brother's son has started to call back them to take out this pizza. But no one is taking phone. After a while some one is started to talk with us but telling something wrong answers. Then we have decided to call them next day. He started to call customer service of their office . Then other person has taken a phone talking politely with him . He listened carefully his complain completely & send one delivery boy to take that pizza back.  Sometime by one experience we tells that this service is not good but after all, all people's are not same. Different people, different services, different experiences we get from the people. So when we want to write about any service we must have to think all these facts."
I really like ordering food from swiggy as they have many offers and discounts they always refund money if there is any fault in food quality I only have problem with delivery boys they do not have manners how to talk to someone who they are delevirng food they use false language and argument with their customer as swiggy has to give some noms as they are loosing their customer just because of delivery boys
"It was my first-time online food order from Swiggy. I order Swiggy on 20-02-2019. Basically, when I placed an order from Swiggy my location was near Rubby. But, Swiggy automatically crawled my GPS location which was wrong, and, I have tried to edit this location, It was not editable. Then I manually entered my location which was near Rubby. After 30minutes I have received a phone call from the delivery boy, he told me that he will not deliver my food at this location. because it was his out of the service area. Also, he told me If he delivers the food, then, I have to pay some extra charge that is 100 Rupees. I told him to cancel my order. After 10 minutes back, the lady from HUBSPOT ADDA(I don't know her name) called me up and told me "" if I cancel this order then I have to pay 75 rupees as a cancelation charge. After all, I have received another phone call from swiggy customer care service executive. The customer care escalation team lady was not responsible to resolve this issue. They are trying to cover it up. The lady was so horrible.  There is some mistake from swiggy:    The customer care people not checking my history properly. They try to cover this issue again and again.    Customer care service is not taking any responsibility for my issue.    Still, I am waiting for their response.      Why I am writing this review, then only they will know good customer pain. This kind of bad customer service will not happen again in the future to the other customers.  The way the escalation lady speaking to me is not at all acceptable. She also covers it up. She is not responsible for this issue.  I really need a solution to this matter.  I am feeling hesitate to give a single rating for them.  Note: Very worst delivery and customer service experience. Please take some knowledge from Zomato."
"Hey friends, This is a very worst website for ordering food. They don't delieverd food on time and also not delivered fresh food. I think it can be due to some reason but 4 or 5 times they did like this only. Then I call customer support they was only arguing they were unable satisfied me. Even they are not ready to accept the mistake from them. Customer care are very careless they just were just trying to cover up the mistakes.  This is outright Insensitive and extremely poor management.  a few days ago I ordered dinner from an well know restaurant of a locality after my order was placed. they showed it will take 40 minutes to deliver but after 2 hours when it was not dispatched from the restaurant I called them and they said it will take more 30 minute's at last the order was delivered to me after 2 hrs 30 min. Attitude of the delivery boy was also very rude. Then I open my parcel and check the food items the one item was missing in it. then again I called them but the customer care was not really helping me out and they said they will give one extra item whenever I will order next time. this is my very worst experience ever to order anything online."
"Swiggy is nice app. It's like food is on your fingertips with all our favorite food stores whether it's branded one or small restaurant of your locality. I ordered maximum time from swiggy. It's gives you real time data of your order you can track your order all the time. Even the person who is delivering food. The packing is always good and up-to the standard. You also have choices to add more wishes things to your order. Swiggy also give lots of cash back with various online payment partner like phone pe , paytm and amazon pay. So just go for it you will never regret it."
"Ordered cake from Cafelicious Mysore which on Discounted price 240Rs actual price is 300Rs. It was my 1st ever order on swiggy so I applied BINGE50(50% discount) code. now price should have been 120. But swiggy waived of discounted price and applied actual price Which cost 150. If you guys cant offer discount why the hell u do this kind of shitty business bloody Sriharsha Majety madur ct, Nandan Reddy madur ct, Rahul Jaimini madur ct."
Aswm app. superb food and very nice.am satisfied with this servics???? ??????very fast delivery and food provided are so helthy.i loved it am all time ordered food by swiggy app.best app.i hope you will all try this amazing app service are good not dout one time try it.????????
I was ordering using Swiggy From Restaurant Near me. When I started payment from debit card my money was cut down but Order was not Placed. When I called Swiggy they said no such Order was cancelled where as my Bank confirmed me that Money was transferred to Swiggy.com.  Also out of frustration I went to restaurant myself and found out that Swiggy was charging me Rs. 1364 where as Restaurant was charging Rs. 982 only. So basically Swiggy is charging Rs. 382 extra just to transport food for 1 Km distance.
"Service is not very good it just ok.  Services of swiggy is very disappointing at night so if you need to get any order at night means after 8'Oclock then you should not go with it because most of the time they dont deliver their orders porperly and dont come on time and you willl be hungry .  customer care executive is not very supportive.  Some time they cancel the order after passing so much time, when they are unable to deliver the order and then you have no more time to make an order with any other service so please be carefull the palce any order with swiggy."
Ordered for food at 2213hrs and it midnight ...still waiting for food..  Chat does not help...also payment taken and no response.....on call they say cant see the chat as they operate separately..  Hang up the phone if the customer is upset....great way to deal with a upset customer and getting away with things.  Really this is what we call service...I know that we have to sleep with no food today but this will not make a damn difference in your life and you guys will keep on doing such mistakes.  Because you guys are used to take us for grab
"""please before placing orders after 9:00 pm on swiggY please be careful because they are not trustworthy to get food delivery on the night if they fail u will be starved ""  I placed the order at around 11 PM, and I received the worst food ever. stored, smelly.  reported the same issue immediately to customer care, but they never helped me and kept on saying that, we will provide you a coupon of Rs.100. which you can use in the next order. but failed to understand that I was hungry and never tried replace the order provided me any other option to order food at that point of time . I had to travel 5 kms at 12 AM to have food . please go through my conversation.  order was of Rs. 255. I really want to understand whos fault it was . why should we go under loss when we havent done any mistake.  I think it was my mistake that from long time i'm using Swiggy  Swiggy is offering me Rs.150 coupon . my question was clear to them that, why should a customer suffer for that.  From the day one, i'm trying to explain the same to everyone . but you people from customer care don't understand my point of view.  I'm really disappointed with your service . i'm using your services from very long time. but had to stop it now . since your customer care doesnt care what we want ."
"Contrary to most of the experiences shared here, mine was really good.  I had never used Swiggy before in any city and my first experience of using it was here in Bangalore. Swiggy was providing a discount of Rs 100 on orders above Rs 400 and hence I decided to go for it. I placed an order for multiple burgers and sides from McDonald’s and used Debit Card for payment. Everything was pretty smooth starting from the payment to Swiggy keeping me updated on every account as to whether the restaurant got my order and whether it was ready or not. They even provided notifications as to when the delivery guy got dispatched and subsequently his position kept dynamically updating on a kind of google map interface.  Even the service time was really fast and I was delivered the food within around 20 minutes.  Also I think McDonald’s Packaging deserves a special mention. I am yet to see other food chains deliver food in such a well packaged manner."
"Swiggy is a waste food delivery service, disgusting is customer care is not getting connected, hey swiggy remove hari dosa vendor, a disgusting taste food providing hotel which charges more n not worth full to money. Disgusting food example : pizza dosa, garlic bread......"
"Swiggi is not worth and cannot stand in this increasing competition of food ventures. My worst experience occurred when I ordered from this site. One of the item was undelivered, though I paid for the whole order. I tried to ignore by just calling once their executive but the way they responded was too negative for me to not loose my cool. Rather than suggesting a solution the customer care executive disconnected my call without explaining anything. The amount of order was nothing as compared to the phone bills it took me to call them. I strongly recommend not to order from swiggy ever."
"Such worst service, staff doesn’t have communication ethics.  First food wasn’t delivered at the office. I came almost on road pic that parcel.  Then the guy was on phone. I asked him to handover but he was on phone. I repeated thrice and he said come out of the gate to collect ur parcel. He started fighting in front of all my staff with me.  He also said don’t teach me how to talk. If you want to receive ur parecel come out or else go!  Such a discussting company and staff... not going to use this app again. UNER and Zomato are far more better, specially ladies don’t use this app and site, bcoz it’s completely insecure."
"Very This app is very good to the sage, it is the most special, but it saves food at the earliest time and many things are good and good.Looking at the needs of the people, the company should make big payments by looking at the needs of the people.Room wants that people are supporting the support map of the company, the company is engaged in the company"
Many of you will agree to me after reading my review.i have been ordering food from swiggy for past 3-4 months at first it was okay but now whenever I order something there comes an problem  Few days ago I ordered dinner from an well know resturant of our locality after my order was placed they showed it will take 45 mins to deliver but after 1 hour when it was not dispatched from the restauranti called them and tey said it will take more 30 mins at last the order was delivered to me after 1.30 hours and the attitude of the delivery boy was also very rude.but when I checked there was 1 item not there so I called them but customer care was not really helping me out and said they will give 1 extra item whenever I will order next time .this was my worst experience ever to order anything online
"Swiggy is not user friendly, i have manuualy typed and uploaded my correct address, once i do that, default gps location to identify address ie map ur location should stop, but it is taking wrong address. Your application is set so. What poor customers will do, also most of the delivery persons are talking rough, no listening skills at all. Poor resource training."
I placed an order for pizza hut for 874 ₹ .pizza hut told me they have discontinued the item 2 months back but swiggy has not updated.swiggy was giving a compensation of RS 100 for all the 2 hours wasted .mr Mehmood their supervisor is just a thorough idiot who does not care for customers nor does he have any courtesy to talk.
I have ordered several times on swiggi and I faced some problems by using swiggi.    food quality is worst    delivery time is not less than 1 hour    uneducated delievey executives    no bill with food    food taste is worst    unable to contact costumer executives      i would never suggest anyone to use swiggi.
"I ordered for food, it was late, called the delivery person to check why it's late, the person blamed restaurant and used vulgar words. I complaint with swiggy and I received only emails saying your complaint is resolved. I feel very worst for using swiggy... The biggest mistake in my life is that using swiggy...."
"Worst food delivery company. They are cheaters. Unprofessional, never ever order in swiggy. Worst app , because of which u will end up cancelling order and the eat all your money. Other instance they will take the order and do not bother to call u or deliver even after one hour and if you cancel then ur money eaten by them. Never deal with these cheaters."
"I ordered Swiggy on 12-02-2019. Basically, I'm a very good customer of Swiggy. They are not delivered proper food and arguing with the customer not even understanding the situation. Three times they delivered missing food orders to me. I was waiting for another couple of hours for the right food, These people not even ready to understand the customer and reality. The first time, I received the wrong food they said mistake happened from the restaurant end. I agreed with that because manual errors are common but they repeated the same mistake again with missing food items. I asked them about the missing item, they are not ready to accept the mistake happened from their end. Now third time today, I have faced the same missing food delivery. I called the customer care, they are not even checking my history they are trying to convince me. The customer care escalation team lady was not responsible to resolve my issue. They are trying to cover it up  Mistakes from Swiggy  1.Delivery person has not checked orders properly at hotel  2.The customer care people not checking my history, simple they are covering up the mistakes  3.Escalation team is not responsible for my issue  4.I'm not received my replacement order but I got msg from swiggy telling that your order is received  5.Making very good customer to anger person and write about the swiggy bad review  6.Still, I'm hungry but they are not even bothered about it  Why I'm writing this review, then only they will know good customer pain. This kind of bad service will not happen again in the future to other customers.  The way the escalation lady speaking to me is not at all acceptable, She also trying to cover it up. She is not responsible for this issue.  Two times I faced this kind of incident and spoke to them about customer experience, they were not taken my feedback strongly. but they are making the same mistake again and again Now I also responsible for this current situation, this time I will not give chance to swiggy people to cover it up.  I need a solution for this.  Note - I don't want to give a single rating to them but the system defaulting taking it"
"Hi,  I have been waiting for my refund from past 20 days and each time I go on chat I am told it would take 5-7 working days.  I have enough of vague promises. Today when I asked they asked me to share my Bank Statement with them. It is very bad chat service what Swiggy provide. There is no customer satisfaction on top of this they are forcing me to wait for some more times  Everytime some or the other chat person would come and repeat the same thing I have copied CEO, COO of the company on my post on linkedin hoping something good would happen. Would request open forum to do something about it. It is not about money always it's about customer satisfaction. Bad Service, Bad response, Bad management https://lnkd.in/fkJekZ5  https://lnkd.in/fBJrnTY  https://lnkd.in/feuhzcG."
"Swiggy is only worried about food food delivery and orders, they are not worried about food quality. I got very poor quality food when I ordered from swiggy, And the restaurant was rated 4.4/5. when I reported the same to customer care, they were offering me Rs 50 coupon and they were saying that is the best they can do. How can some one can trust Swiggy if poor quality food is delivered from swiggy from a restaurant with rating 4.4."
"I ordered three items today from KC restaurant through swiggy, one item was missing, when I informed the customer care, she said she was generating some sort of a coupon which can be used later. I never got the coupon nor any msg as acknowledgement of my complaint. Very disappointed with swiggy. Would never order again."
Pathetic service on call. Initially shubondho told me to refund a coupon of 75 because of 1 missing item then he put d call on hold discussed with his senior and told me back that now he would generate a coupon of 25. I refused to take it coz I'm not a beggar. I need a refund of 75 only which was told by you earlier.
"Hello dear  My name is vipin, I want to food order online swiggy and zomato.  I ask my friend which restaurant he suggest me The Belly Fix, valley view estate, Gawal Pahari sector 56 gurgaon. I find the restaurant The Belly Fix on both portal but not available on both portal swiggy and zomato. I want to order The Belly Fix becouse food is so delicious and yummy.

I think its not good if swiggy and zomato not resolve the issue for The Belly Fix.  I request swiggy and Zomato make live The belly Fix on your portal asap  thanks and regards  vikas"
I like the swiggy service. The packaging of swiggy and delivery is fabulous. But the user friendlyness of application is not good. ! Needs the improvement on UI. Because when we open the app it's asking every time address even when we saved it or not. And the UI Is not user friendly as per the Zomato and other food delivery app.
"Pathetic just pathetic. I order butter chicken then after I received a call saying that there is no chicken in the hotel order something else, I ordered paneer after 5 min order get cancelled money refunded{ after wasting 45 min} I ordered 5 types of tiffin then I received a call saying that there is no bajji I said add something else he asked me to pay the difference I said thats OK then again another call saying one more item unavailable I said any item 5 plates is ok in the next 5 min order get cancelled and I got my money refund .11pm I was feeling so hungry ditched .{ ORDER NO: #32720141350} As if they are giving their money send multiple msgs that your money is refunded. 11 Msgs in fact. Please stay away zomato and uber are better ."
This app was very good for odder food and this app is also provide fresh food and in less amount and the owner of this app was indian and he is quit job from mytra and this app is also provide refer and earn option and this is also provide very variety of any food and this is also provide your favourite restaurant for odder food and I was mainly odder food from swiggy
Services are good but the food served is too bad.The proportions send by several restaurants are too tiny to have after paying such a big amount.Once we ordered biryani from a big franchise for around rs 1000 and when it was delivered it was not even enough for two person.Food send by the restaurants and outlests are of no taste once recieved the customer has no options left with so unfortunately customers has to eat it.  So guys please dont be lazy and either cook urself or go to the restaurants and outlets Yourself and buy personally.
I don't know why these companies stop caring about their customer after a successful year. first year of swiggy was really helpful and delighted but now since they have expanded enough(I guess) so they do not care about their customer.  Being a customer we all should condemn these companies otherwise after 5 years they will start creating the monopoly.
I live in Mumbai.  Yesterday when I was going through Phoenix Mall and I was crossing the road I saw the delivery boy from Swiggy who was standing in front of untidy and small stall.  I waited there for sometime and started observing him I saw that he took parcel from that stall.  I was surprised that Swiggy delivers the food from unclean and such small stall after being such a big brand.  People think that they are eating clean and tidy food ordered from Swiggy but yesterday I come to know the reality of Swiggy and suggest you not order food from such kind of websites.
I have ordered veggie patty from subway but patty was missing inside it. And test was not good. Too much souces are added. Bread used was not good. Will never buy from Swiggy. Cucumber was bitter in test.  Delivery person was also not much professional
I am a foodie person and using many food delivery app like zomato and uber also and they are good app  but swiggy is total worst and useless app  i gives some points to prove it    they are provide limited restaurants    very high rate for delivery - I order a twister from al beik fast food mp nagar and then I was at shop but they provide 30 rupees for delivery charge so I cancel it.    no service in many of area in every city      4.they spend very long time in delivery and you can only waiting  5.fraud with customers - they gives you many promotion code and say its available against any mode of payment but if you want cash on delivery then you got error message    if you want some help and call customer support then their are a long process for this and after you follow all process then all officeer will got busy and you will waiting every time
This product is good .but some delivery boy's behavior is too bad .this product give 50% discount which is a great help to poor people. Delivery boy reach home at 45-50 minute but in some case delivery boy said that the map show the wrong direction. Some delivery boy working hard . If the company have own restaurant and add more restaurant then the delivery is more first then now.
"Firstly delivery of food with the given time and few exclusive food from restaurants and available as same as competitors apps, I have atleast to 15time a month from swiggy but the service is good but offering and cashback are limited but chose by restaurants and order then the quantity and quality will be the same. I got swiggy exclusive restaurants near my house homely which serves healthy, less oil and good quality for nominal prices.As a food delivery app swiggy is doing good as compared to its competitors."
Swiggy known to be doing in the market has build up attitude and this is very disappointing. Day by day the customer service is not helping the customers and looting their money.  I ordered two times and they have deducted my money and given me wrong food today. After numerous attempt still they are not solving my problem and looting me.  This has been my worst experience and I do not recommended using swiggy. I will definitely stop using swiggy with poor customer satisfaction and problem resolving capabilities.  Shut down you business swiggy if you can’t adress customer issues
Swiggy is the worst food delivery app. The customer service is even worse. After an hour of booking my order the delivery executive says that your address is not traceable through GPS. They also deducted 75 Rs for order cancellation. No refund in credit card only in their account. Even If you Don't want to use their service again your money is stuck with them. BEWARE OF SWIGGY. WORST.
A very disappointing thing..my order was placed by Swiggy on 31 jan 2019 at 10:34pm  And after 1 hr 30 min i recieved a message saying that your order has been canceled  Order was canceled on 1st feb 2019 at 12am  I had a call from customer care for the refund..but here the thing is not abt the refund the thing is abt the service...after 12 am at midnight where all shops are closed at that time from where i will place my order an have food...and second thing is that whil placing order we have to pay immediatly and at the time of refund it takes 24hrs...such a shmeful thing it is...now i dont have extra money..i have paid all the money...my order has been canceled its almost midnight ...i had no food..wht shuld i do now...should i jst wait fr your refund???  Very disappointing...Plzz look after this...  I have proof of txt msg of order placed n cancellation with me which is attached below
Swiggy delivery executive is unprofessional and talk with bad manners . I ordered but executive called me and saying i am outside and don't know your location if you come to my location than i give you otherwise you cancel it his l exertion is also bad so please avoid order from this
"I tried swiggy first time and placed the order for Afgani chicken. First the order was not traceable then after few follow-up calls it was delivered after 1 hours.  after having one bite of chicken, I realized its not cooked properly and noticed some insects in chutney and at the corner of the box.  Though I got the refund after a complaint with a statement by swiggy team that THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE CONTROL.  then I quite for a while and hangup the conversation. Hope you understand my reason of frustration after listing these words.  @mouthshut - why I am not able to attach pictures"
I have order vadapav in gandhinagar by using swiggy app.  I got a gentle reply from the company and they said that sir will provide you the best food.We get our vadapav in time as per order and the delivery boy delivered with a smile on hos face.  Overall I loved its service.Swiggy is more better as compared to zomato.
I wold like to share to all the facilities provide by swiggy is very very good .for all venders .there delivery functuion is good.so I would like suggest to all plz use swiggy .facility. and definitely you will be staisfied function of the swiggy .  Theri staff and boy have good manner to treat customer.
"In Ahmedabad it is good and most of the restaurant are available, we can also cancel easily and there are lot of offers when we sign up also as they give us 5 offers when we sign up and each cashback is of 150 rupees.When I first tend to start the app there was cache in the app and when I contacted the customer service they have helped me well."
Swigifood quality is good and his dlivery is also good and dilivery is very faster and overall is very good good discount is also available in this app and food is good in qulity and very good pack in box and this app track path and contentct information is very good I like this app and isuggeat every one try this app at list one time
Such an stupid management it is.I don't even understand how these people doesn't even have proper communication in between them.I had ordered at 8.20PM and I continuously got call from customer care that they doesn't have the dish which I have ordered and they gave me few options and asked to change and it happens I had changed my dish.After 5 min I got another call from customer care and told even that dish is not available and asked me to change and again they gave me only 1 option and I confirmed it.after some time I again got a call by saying that item is not available and you can choose another item I was bit anger and selected an item.After all this I got call from rider saying nothing is available I asked to hand over call to restaurant manager and he told we can provide you what ever item you need but it takes 20 mins I told ok. But make as soon as possible and after 1 hour and 50 mins I got a call from rider by asking me to cancel the order because it takes more 1 hour. What is this.These people had wasted all my time and wasted my time by calling to change my order. And finally at 10 PM they asked me to cancel and go with other restaurant.Order Id #31676048922  Worst App I have ever seen.  This is the 3rd time I am facing this problem.  In once case without intimating they have cancelled my order.  Please don't waste your time in ordering in Swiggy . Better use other food apps
According to my personal expirence  Guys really swiggy is worse which the menu of resturants are higher prices and they will keep offers which they are getting profit for example I will say onething  if ‘x’ product actual price is 100Ruppe  and they will keep it as 130 ruppe like that and they will give us offer like 15% discount and fake us so really it worse food delivery app I prefer with uber or zomato those are better than this one really trust me once try hope my review is helpful you guys to know about the swiggy
"I had ordered nilgiri chicken from Homely from swiggy app. The picture of the curry was looking delicious lip-smacking with nice chicken pieces in green gravy.  In fact I ordered 2 of the same item for my Sunday lunch with family.To my utter disbelief the order came in minute boxes with small cubes of chicken in water like green gravy tasting like urgggggg mud.  Please don't order from this so called ""Homely"" restaurant."
"I entered my home address, and the delivery executive went to another location.  40 minutes after my delivery was placed, I was asked to cancel the order because he was too far away to deliver it. Furthermore, the lady in customer service told me that I would have to pay charges for cancelling this delivery.  Absolutely ridiculous. I was expected to pay for the delivery executive's mistake. Pathetic service by swiggy. I would not recommend this app to anybody."
First up all they are only delivery partners not food makers and they maintain their staffs available anytime because I worked in a restuerent where swiggy partners.Another think they keep delivery drivers logging in time otherwise their incentives are not to them.so swiggy in control and time keeping delivery partner.best of all in chennai.
Initially o users to like swiggyas they were fast n reliable..also they did not hv the delivery charges and the package charges were not thre...of late I have noticed that they are adding the delivery charges..plus package charges....packing of food is the duty of the restaurant n is not to be charged...plus every restaurant has free delivery....GST is ok I can understand...also they r becoming very slow....the service of swiggy is becoming worse day by day
"It is easy to use, it respects you, problem solver they know what is your problems they try to resolve it as quick as that could if you have more problem with your delivery then they give your money back quickly they are gentle you can also take replace ment within 24-48 hours I personally ordered from it many times"
Nice experience.need some improvments in the app.need to fix some bugs of the app.overall the experience with this app is good.i like it.had a great time.i am giving 3 for customer support out of 5.and 4 out of 5 for food quality.3/5 for service.thank to swiggy.com.
"I have been working at swiggy part time more than 2 months, its a wonderful journey till now.and upcoming months also wonderful and I enjoy my work.  Management will take care of every employee.  No downside to discuss its very smooth journey with swiggy and its also good place for freshers, didn't have too much work but some time there is work load"
Swiggy is the most fraud food app I have ever come across though the quality of food is ok but they charge high.  They cheat when you pay by card. They deducted the double price of my order and when I complained about it they said it was by mistake but it took about one month when I finally got my money after that I never ordered fr9m them
"So I wont bore you with a long story.    I order stuff    Wrong stuff comes    The delivery boy refuses    The support center drags it for 2 hr and then says they cant do anything as the delivery boy is refusing to a second time    They return me my money in form of cupons    They are theives      I sent email to CEO and he chose not to respond.  After enough graveling I orderd again and stuff was missing, this time they said they wont give me my money back"
"Horrible delivery experience, executives are not assigned timely. For 30 mins delivery they take 2 hours. Pathetic response from customer service number. They just know to say sorry and have no idea on delivery time.  Multiple follow-ups needed to even know whether food will come to you. I ended up twice cancelling my order after knowing no delivery executive is assigned even after 1.5 hrs wait"
I love swiggy because it will always be there for me when I am hungry ????.Most of the time I het offers from them.The service is very good and the best quality of them is that they deliver the food much faster than the time that they had mentioned.  This app is a huge blessing for people who are busy with their work and doesnt have the time to cook????
"I have ordered chicken biryani with chicken 65 in Chennai using swiggy., and the delivery is done in time.and even the way the food is packaged is good. no spills or leaking of curry or the gravy was encountered.the food was hot enough while reaching me. the real time live tracking was helpful in knowing the position of the delivering person althrough his drive. when I have booked the order I cancelled it by mistake and bokked the same again. the swiggy team called me and confirmed one of the orders. totally good experience with swiggy"
"I had Placed An order on 17th May 2019 which was delivered a manner that I had to throw a food. the issue was highlighted at the same moment on Swiggy app but no one was availabe at 12: 30 pm and someone came on that chat at 2nd in the night just to tell me that he is clossing my issue as I am not available, why on earth do you expect me to be available at 2nd in the night . I wrote a mail 28th May the very nexy day and received an automated reply that someone to wake up at swiggy office and help me in my issue , best part about swiggy is which I too got to know now is that you cannot connect to any of their customer care number if you do not active."
"In Coimbatore I ordered the pizza, they make sure that the order will arrive in 30 minutes but the delivery was a bit late it take 42 minutes to reach. So the timing is little bit have to improve. The quality of food means the packing, freshness and hotness of food is very good is like we are eating in the restaurant. The behaviour of the delivery boy was very good as he was sorry for being late. But he delivered the food to my hotel room , I have to go to ground floor to receive it. Overall the performance is good. I rate it 3.5 out of 5 star."
"I am from kerala , when I was in kochi for a job related work, I used swiggy for almost for 10 days as daily food deliver . I bought food 3 times a day even 4 times in some days . It was a smooth exprience with them . Their delivery was speedy enough . It took less than 45 min to deliver food to my room . It is quicker then if I could have bought my self going shop . Food was also tasty and was packed pretty good . the delivery boy was also a good guy  Over all good exprience with swiggy : D"
"I was ordered pizza on swiggi from known pizza brand. & Even i was tested same pizza from there so I know the test.. but from swiggi, i got worst pizza ever. Please don't use these app bcz they taken your order from any location & just pack into box of that brand. I think those have here own small shops in near by locations they just picked it from there."
I had placed on order on 16 january 2019 which was delivered in a manner that I had to throw that food. the issue was highlated at the same moment swiggy app but no one was avaiable at 1: 40 pm and someone came on that chat at 2 in the night just to tell me that he is clossing my issue as I am not a avaiable.  best part of swiggy is which I got to know that you cannot connectto any of there customer care number if you do not have an active member
"The shops which are near to you get more comfort to you abd so delivered food is hot and its test is better.  So we can use swiggy for more food orders and so ordered near food and yhose makes food better than long tasty.but you can also ordered so many food items at one time and so you wiil able to make many food items delivry at one time.you can also add the meals of your home and so you will enjoy your meal at a time and your delviery ratings wiil able to next delivery of the meals and so on much more than just ordered fiid.and you can able to cancel orders if you are any problem at that situation and they should apply minimum charges on your order but, you will ordered to cod ( cash on delivery ) so no charges are include to that customer and that delivery boy so you enjoy your food daily and any time by your food items nears to you and at any place that you know which you like"
"Must try, ordering food from your favourite restaurants.timely delivery and order status update.Delivery person is professional.  No minimum order.  You can oder food from any part of bangalore.only delivery times varies depending on restaurants location. I had a good experience ordering from swiggy."
"I ordered my food on 3 jan 2019, and later Swiggy cancelled because restaurant didn't accept my order. It's been 11 days I haven't received my refund, while swiggy claimed that you would get your refund within 5-7 days, I don't know what should I do, I have had chat multiple time with chat support, they said we have initiated refund from our side and check with your resource. Please help me if anybody have idea, otherwise I have decided to knock the door of court, it is not about 200-300rs, it is about the unethical process."
"Swiggy is running with highly unprofessional staff and support team. Do not do deal with them they are absolutely non professional people.  We ordered food on my daughter birthday.food expected to reach within 40 Min., which took 2 hrs and even after so many times tried they are not confirming order. and main part food received with ice cold condition, when asked delivery person asked to speak to support. at very first support ready to refund. But when we contacted after two days they directly denied to refund as confirming there is no such a case we received with your ordered.  They are just refuse to take delivery complaint again.  that was worst birthday experience for my daughter.  Swiggy is highly not recommended as the are absolutely irresponsible idiots and dumb people.  There are plenty of other option available in market do not do deal with swiggy"
I would like order on swiggy because the of food is amazing look like a tasty food I have many option but I choose swiggy the dilvery is so fast in free time while I am hungry I order on swiggy swiggy is the best way to order food my friends also order on swiggy they also like food and its so tasty and colourful o.
"I have used swiggy multiple times and I have not been disappointed. Although the delivery takes a bit of time, the service is great. Especially the customer service.  Ones I had ordered food from The Spot from kanjurmarg and when the food had arrived, the extra sauce which I had paid extra 30 Rs was not there. I immediately contacted the customer service and was asked if I wanted to wait for it to be delivered or to get the refund. I had asked for a refund and immediately the refund was processed back to my paytm account.  Another instance was when I had ordered food and the delivery guy asked me to cancel the order and reorder it as he wouldn't be able to deliver it. Since I had prepaid from paytm, the amount had been debited. So I contacted the customer service and on explaining the situation was informed that the amount will be refunded and was advised that if such a situation occured then I just need to contact the customer service and they'll handle the rest.  Although the delivery seems a bit off, the customer service has redeemed it and has made sure that they haven't lost a customer."
Very bad behavior of delivery boy he threatened me an abused me and swiggy itself canceled my order and he was misbehaving me and asking me to cancel that order and he asked my number he called me by swiggy app and then called me on my number its very bad of this type of behavior from swiggy
"Swiggy is not able to provide service even after so many follow up after confirmed order in metro city. For order ID 30344659054 the estimated time was 25 minutes. After 45 minutes one swiggy customer care called and told the order is cancelled due to technical issue. After 50 minutes another care told order is replaced by new order so told to wait another 10-15 mins to deliver. After 1.5 hour of ordering swiggy care told the order is cancelled. It's very unfortunate to say without any issue in road and restaurant, swiggy is unable to provide delivery service.  Swiggy said it was due to technical issue but its identified during placing order. They had alternate solutions and promised to deliver within 10-15 minutes but not done."
We order and the delivery never happend.  App shows order delivered but not deliver by delivery boy.  Every time customer care told that delivery boy is coming in 15 mins. We waited around 2 hrs till 11 PM but no order received.  Totally unprofessional.
This is the worst service I have received so far where the delivery guy told me he won't deliver just because the pickup address was picked up wrong and finally cancelled the order. This is not the way customers should be tested at any cost ! I don't think I will ever order from here again! Sorry to say u lost a very loyal customer!
Swiggy has introduced super service now which is really amazing with no delivery charges and above all a chmce to apply coupon codes as well to get extra discoint on food ordered.Kuodos to swiggy for offering service. Its always a pleasure to use swiggy when hungry and there are often number of coupons available as well for discounts.
"Yummm! Swiggy is really good at its work & promotion. However, delivery time taken is quite more than zomato. But, delivery boy gives the food at place, no matter where the destination is.  I personally love its service : )  Especially, the offers or promo codes which makes the food reasonable. Every one can afford it & if not that can once try. It even gives on time status or running status of where your meal is, that's really helpful. And the food comes well packed & warm, as it is freshly cooked. Moreover, when I have any query I can contact or chat with Swiggy, so no need to worry on any matter.  Must try it, I mean having your favorite meal from your favorite restaurant at your doorstep.  I ordered various items & found it all good. For me it is like ""NO COOKING JANUARY""; )"
Good Evening Friends  I want to share my experience with all of you. Swiggy is a big brand in food delivery market. But the service of this company is not good. I order more than 20 times from swiggy in which three time the items were missing. I call the customer care executive they do not respond well. They said the price of missing item value will bi refunded not the whole amount. They do not care about wasting our food and money. Their refund process is also so slow. I recommend you to order not from swiggy. Your money and food not be wasted.  Thanks
"Used it, but when issues occur they act like it's our fault. Not once. Not expected from you. Had so many orders from you. But now regret from your unhealthy service. Anything like negative star I would have given you. I hate it . I hate it. I hate it."
"When Swiggy launched it was good, but now after 1 year its services was worst, Very poor,  Was recently some item, when I called delivery Man he was soo rude speaking like an illiterate.  When food delivered I saw package was just opened when I asked he said speak to a restaurant I don't know.  Guys before taking a product please check it properly."
"Ordered food and then I had to answer innumerable calls from all around, the adress was clearly written on the delivery address.but somehow these guys failed to read it.  Later I recieved a message saying that my order was cancelled since I failed to answer the delivery boy's call.  If you have to answer 8 calls for a simple delivery of food, would you bother taking the 9th call.  Again, one of the worst ever experience."
"I live in Thrissur, Kerala and swiggy has been launched here recently. I have had a very very good experiance by ordering food through this app. There are lots of offers and discounts in the app that allow us to get our favourite food in a pocket friendly manner.  Also all the famous and best restaurants in our place, thrissur are available in the app.  They show all the dishes available in a restaurant irrespective of the discounts or offer unlike ubereats which shows the dishes that are on offer only.  Swiggy has been my favourite ever since I have used the app and I always order food every now and then from it.  Their customer service is good and can be easily contacted through chat or call in case u want to cancel or change the menu. They offer quite a good service and assistance.  The delivery boys attitude is also very good and must to mention. Once I had given the wrong address by mistake and did not realise it. But they managed to deliver me the food at the right time.  Food packaging and handling is also the best."
Without informing the customer they want to cancel the order! Stupid delivery guy inspite of explaining the address dint want to come to my location!!! I explained the address to the delivery guy and customer carr executives again and again!!! But they did not listen! Just a sorry wont help!! what do this swiggy people thi???? We have whole lot of time to just speak to their executives and keep explaining the address!! How can they keep delivery boys who have no idea about any location!!! What’s the purpose of keeping a delivery guy who don’t know any location!!! We can’t keep explaining! After explaining a thousand times he reached my address and suddenly he disconnected my call!! And I received a message saying my order got cancelled!!! What the fk!!!
"Disgusting.. repetitive issue.. Ordered food at 8:19 and delivery executive was not assigned / reached the restaurant till 9:20.. when called customer care, they asked to cancel the existing order and place a new order.. PATHETIC FROM SWIGGY..  Order no. 29947761541"

"Swiggy is one of the best food delivery party which I used till now, they provide food what they show.  Unlike zomato they are genuine not as zomato who show good and delives bad.  Food is also delivered fast and delivery person are a lso kind natured.  Tgey are very helping and kind they do not complain if I change my location or ask them to deliver at some other place.  They gives good offers too, they are genuinely good.  I support swiggy."
"A very gud application for ordering yum food where ever you are an very help full and appreciate , trusted application u can make payments safely form bank accounts and you can pay by cash too and very polite staff and ready to help for services anytime recommended swiggy anytime anywhere amy any one can download usein and android or apple phones"
"I have ordered the food at 9.17pm and displayed as 30m delivery, then I ordered the food, unfortunately it was delay... When contacted swiggy on chat conversation assured that food will get delivered with in 10m  And mentioned mobile of delivery person..  I called him, he rudly replied still not reched hotel, it will take another 45m.. same story mentioned on swiggy chat and given another delivery person mobile number and again I called him . He replied sir still I am not your food..."" Eralier delivery person took food and went away"" your order cancelled..  Again new story mentioned on swiggy chat..  Got replied Food would deliver another 10m..  I requested.pl arrange for food since it's too late andmy kid is waiting food..  If hotel having too much order better to don't consider new order or better to mention exact time of delivery..  It's really wrost service and response"
Poor and slow service delivery agent is very rude in nature.day before yesterday I order from swiggy delivery agent is not come to correct location and say that I can't find your location my gps is also on I told him many times for location but than also he say I can't find you come amd take your order than I go and take my order worst service I received from swiggy. improvement is required in delivery and they also take too much dilevery charges.and they also improve their delivery services people who delivers the food is very unhygienic some time food is not fresh and hot
"Not at all good delivery. I ordered two items, one of them was wrong.they urgently sent the replacement but still my guest were gone and very badly I wasted my time to complain. I think people must check first about what are they going to deliver and then proceed for it.  How can I post a copy of bill to show my order"
"I Am Really Satisfied By The Service Of Swiggy.  I Ordered One Bbq Pizza And Two Shakes From Fuel Station, The Delivery Is On Time The Most Amazing Thing Is That Swiggy Gives A Lot Of Offers Like 50% off on first 5 orders And Many More I Recommend Everyone To Order From Swiggy.  They Call You Before The Delivery To Know Your Exact Location You Can See The live Location Of An Delivery Person On Swiggy App Which Is Really Helpful To Know Where The Delivery Person Is.  According To This We Can Call The Person."
"Swiggy although added convenience to life but there are services issues as well. If wrong or bad order is delivered, customer becomes helpless with order as there is no option to return/replace the order. There is no support from swiggy also, they just take feedback doing nothing."
I ordered burger from swiggy . Burger was good but small compare to photo . Overall I like the burger. I ordered at 4: 20 pm after 15 minutes my order reached to me. I thought that it may delivered in half an hour but it delivered in half time that I thought .  Its a good app it shows live delivery . Their is so many items in very low price . They gives 50% cashback on first order on paytm .
"I had ordered dinner from Northern Frontier in Yerwada. Food was delivered in a loose cover, food spilled inside and open as shown in picture.  Such reputee restaurant in Pune are delivering food with packaging not lesser than a street side restaurant"
On 29thbof dec 2018.me and my friend decided to order food.we chose up the SWIGGY.as we got the money from our parents to celebrate new year 2019.So as we decided to order the food.and we ordered DOUBLE EGG CHICKEN ROLL COSTS AROUND Rs 60 for two.as we are student and resides in hostel.so the truth is we get limited amount of money for our pocket.anyway.lets move.we waited around 1 hour.and the order showed on receipt is delivered.we were surprised.because we didn't get the food.we called swiggy customer care.he was sorry for that and actually he was so polite.the truth was the restaurant we orderd from.is 13 km away from our university and that was around 11: 30 pm. I dont know what happened with our order.but we thought the delivery boy paid for order insted of coming over here.and at that night we decided not to order anymore for that night.we ate biscuits.??
"Dear concerned,  I have ordered one veg shahi Briyani and one biriyani spl veg on 31st Dec 2018 around 9.00pm.  The delivery boy came to deliver the items around 10.00pm and he delivered the items and he asked to use swiggy app through my phone since his battery was low. The moment he took my phone he started using app and cancelled the order. I asked him, why he cancelled it. He said he can get little more money from it and he left.  Later when I looked into the parcel, one of the parcel was open and surprisingly it was non-veg Biriyani. Being a pure vegetarian how can I eat that.  So I communicated to swiggy through help desk.  They could not resove the issue even after 2-3 days.  And I wrote a mail to support as well and no reply.  It would be appreciated if you could resolve the issue as soon as possible.  I hope the action reflects customer relationship."
Well nowadays food delivery app like swiggy are high on rise and very less on price.but have you ever thought why they give this much of heavy discounts? The answer is they have a special tie up with the restaurants they advertise. The remaining 50% money they take it from restaurants as means of advertising them into their apps. Also there is a huge problem with the app as it lacks all the time and also the payment method ( online) is not good. This app completely falss flat in terms of delivery.also the customer support is pathetic and doesn't give any response to your queries.
"The pathetic site for online food ordering. They served me cold pizza and upon complaint said that they will look into the matter but can't do anything about that order, means I have to eat that cold pizza. Sheer cheating and looting the customers. Will never recommend this or use it again for ordering. Beware of such sites and better go out and dine"
"Swiggy.com it a un satisfied website. And you choose better website to order food items. It's alate processing website. Other than swiggy other websites sre good in fooddelivery., ., . so swiggy.com is unsatisfied customer and me so choose better website to order food or deliver food????"
"One of the best service I have experienced so far with swiggy. It helps me tracking the order and also you can let driver deliver the food as per your guide.  Swiggy delivers the food on time and there customer service is really mind blowing.  Kind of food that swiggy delivery is just wonderful. They secure food with well certified containers and deliver the quality of food to there customer on time.  Swiggy has option to order from breakfast to tasteful desert.  Also, sometime I even got 50% off on my 5 orders which really made me happy.  I would really recommand swiggy to my friends and family because it deserves the best."
Swiggy is now trending of food deliverys it time to time place to place to any where to order it so best option the swiggy come to any where of local arears are identifiable areas all so to delivery times is so faster than a rocket and the different different food items can order it but so care full than so happy
Very bad experience I have placed one order swiggy apps after 3hr that say that we can not delivere this order. . .
I had a wonderful experience with swiggy. Dilivery guy was polite and food was nicely packed. Loved the app and will recommend it to any food lover. Only quality check and swiggys own recognised chain could also be an addition to the services. It will make a special supply chain to the foodies in the town and will replace unwanted or improper vendors which not only will help in developing quality but also ensure food standards
"We ordered one cheese burst pizza , 3 choco lava and one roasted chicken wings at 10 22 we immediately recieved confirmation order and after waiting for an hour, we called swiggy help line and we were told that food is prepared so please wait for 10mn more so we decided to wait for 10 more, after we called swiggy help line at least 4 times and the 5 time Mr. Pinku Gupta, one of your executive said that we are not able to connect to the restaurant and after wards he asked to cancel our order as there were no other options , after waiting for 2 hrs 15mn me were told that order is not placed plus refund will be done within 3 -4 days .. worst experience ever .. this is my first and probably the last time that I will face this experience. Happy new year. !"
I ordered Veg Shanghai Noodles from freshmenu restaurant through swiggy and what they had delivered is Non veg Rice. Seriously they didn't check what is ordered and what is delivered. I am pure veg and they provide me with non veg rice. After I registered my complain there is no reply from them.
The order was placed at 9:33 . We have almost waited for more than an hour but no response. They say that they can’t track the order wheras the aishwaryasingh23ment is made and the order is confirmed. Its disgusting to see how these people mAnasultange their deliveries on such rush hours and cant live up to what they say.  @swiggy @dominoz Cant believe how irresponsible you can be.
"When we order food, that's not worth for money and very low quantity, we ordered north indian thaali, items were missing, also momos was not steamed well...very pathetic...really disappointed...I'll never order again... Don't want prefer anybody...oh"
"It's the worst service ever I have experienced.  I have ordered for the very first time with Swiggy, but to my wonder after opening the packet saw only onion and some unhealthy colourful sauce while the food item was missing and after calling the executive got a feedback like they can't help means it's a waste of money and u will not taste any food  I suggest beware of such fraud n cheaters"
"Most worst servise as comparing to the other, and frauds towards their customer's credit  Wrong advertisements, late delivery,  No timely refunding, worst presention of food to the customer  If any customer place their order as per choise so swiggy is unable to provide it timely and always wasting their customers time"
"Very very bad service, communication is not propre........really bad experiance after waiting so long and loose some money....really very very bad communication and service......never trust again....., ..................................................."
"I am a super member of Swiggy but for last 4-5 months i have experienced worst with the swiggy...first of all they hardly deliver in time. At begining, swiggy was good but now a days they have been pne of the worst... Sometime food quality related issues sometime payment sometime delivery time related Nd in brief it can be said they dont resolve the issue and even after promise they repeat the same prblm in later order.... I m really fed up with swiggy thts why i m writing this review...plz dont go with swiggy ...other better options are available in market....thanks"
"On 29 Dec 2018 at around 9: 30 p.m. I had placed an order with swiggy for 10 plain chapatis 1 boondi raita from a restaurant in Jaipur - Mahadev dhaba in Mansarovar locality , the order delivery time shown was 37 mins . after half an hour I checked swiggy app to get an update regarding my order, I saw the status said food is being prepared and delivery partner has arrived at the restaurant, however in map the location of the delivery partner was not at the restaurant and somewhere else. I reported this to customer support to which they said everything is fine its a technical glitch please be assured your order will be delivered . after half an hour I again chatted with customer support they reassured me that food will be delivered. The case couldn't get through to the delivery partner and figured out the person is not accessible . ti which the guy manually assigned anothe delivery person and assured he will reach in next 5 mins and pick up your order and deliver in 20 minutes , after another 30 mins I again had to chat with cse coz guess what I still dont have my order , the cse reassured the food will be delivered and I get a call from the delivery guy that the order cannot be deliverd coz some other guy has already picked up tbe order and the restraunt has refused to give the order again hence the delivery partner has refused to deliver and cancelled his delivery . mind you this is after 15 - 20 mins the guy was at the restraunt . and the cse was assuring that order will be delivered . rather than resolving the problem then the cse started pushing me that I should cancel the order and place the order again . I firmly refused to cancel my order and asked for an explaination to why the food is not delivered to me in promised time , all of them has same answer to this we are soory you had to go through tragic and unfortunate incidence . and would close tge chat without even answeri g to the questions . I had to chat with 6 diffetent cses at different times and my order was delivered at around 12: 00 a.m. poor poor poor service ."
"I ordered Sabudana Khichdi from Falahaar and Kota Kachori through Swiggy. There was a cockroach in the Sabudana Khichdi.  Images are attached. I ordered Pizza from Pizza hut They took 2:30 hours to deliver a Pizza. Pizza became cold and not eatable, but did not get any support from Swiggy."
"I like the concept behind Swiggy. Delivery at your door steps, thats what the company says.  However, the executives who deliver at my Office in Kothaguda do not carry their ID cards or they actually do not want to come and deliver and just leave from the main entrance.  Off late it has been a practive from their end to not carry ID cards which is making it difficult for us to place orders via swiggy.  This way Swiggy would loose too many customers."
"Swiggy one of fasttest growing in food door delivery, as of my experience with swiggy, in local within city limits its ok they charge normal food rates , but outside city limts charges are heavy, ithink company should look in to this.i expect more offers for this newyear hope swiggy will grow better in 2019"
When you order on swiggy with your card or wallet than you will never receive the order and got a massege from Swiggy that items deliverd and when you triying their customer care they reply very badly  below are my order id on swiggy 29059133984 items not delivered and they are not agree to pay my refund  Ashish Sharma
"I am big time foodie but do not even know survival cooking:funny, thank to swiggy to start serving my location, now I can get up late in the morning withing worrying about my breakfast and lunch, the only complaint that I have with them is sometime some of the restaurants are available till 12-1 in the night but it shows closed in mobile app, need to work in this."
"Using  Swiggy, you can order food & beverages online from restaurants near & around you.  Swiggy employees about Pay & Benefits.          Swiggy announced the launch of its latest offering - Swiggy POP - single-serve meals that save time.   There was a time when a cab in 15 minutes was considered quick. Today, this same time period is considered too long. Same with food delivery.  In today’s fast-paced  world, people seek an ordering-in experience at affordable prices and zero delivery cost, and Swiggy has the answer in the form of POP. Swiggy on Wednesday announced the launch of Swiggy POP across Bengaluru, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Pune, indor, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata."
"I had used swiggy for ordering food. The order was for chicken fried rice. The taste of the product was nice but with the added cost of the delivery and the swiggy, its expensive.  The customer service is not nice. They don't even bother with the reply. And the delivery of the food was so late. It took more than the expectation. And the delivery guy was so annoying and arrogant he was not even cooperative enough to come to the address, saying I did not find the address, I had to walk almost 50m.  Just one thing Good about the swiggy is that you gets 33 percent off on your 1st order. And after that it's not that useful. The cost of everything is high. It should be made for everyone instead of for those who can only afford expensive food. And the cost needed to be reduced of the swiggy and delivery.  So, it needs improvement, until then this app is not worth using. So, I won't recommend this app to order food."
It is a good app  This app gives you a better and fast delievery  And fresh food it takes less time to order  And you can cancel a order too .  Every one can order food from this app and get it delivered to you anywhere .  And it has more varietyy of restaurants hotels and etc.  Overall it is a superb app
"My experience with Swiggy has been the worst. I had made online payment for my order and it got delivered to someone else. Delivery boy was not attending my calls. He didn't even call before delivering the order. He just reached the nearby address and delivered the order to someone else without asking anything about the order.  I kept sending messages for a week and didn't get my refund. The customer support team doesn't keep any records. They keep asking to elaborate the issue again and again. After a week, I got message that as it has been more than 48 hours, we cannot help you.  Abysmal Services! No refund for incorrect delivery! Worst Customer Support!"
Service very best .order ferfectly give time.and verry neetly served and packing is verry neetand clean.service is good and fast.and smile face server you seeing .what u buying in the your order quantty and quality akways good.i recomended the swiggy is very nice and good to buying on line dishes in every where
"Made an order at Café Coffee Day - MBD House, Delhi yesterday 10:15 PM through SWIGGY, with order id 28917906519 and waited it to deliver almost an hour as it was showing food being prepared. Later, it wasn't delivered and utterly disappointed with your pathetic services. Am definitely going legal for this as this is complete fraud on your part."
"I live in Goa, and Panaji is the capital and the swiggy service is available there. I travel 26 Km to College in Panaji, When First time I came to know about swiggy, I thought It won't be available in Panaji, but for my surprise it was.  Few days back i made my first order on Swiggy for lunch at college as there was 50% discount on first 5 orders it made me more excited.I opened the website and found that it was easy to use and the user interface was clean and easily understandable, the site was simple yet appealing.First they ask you to choose your location and there is also an option to mark your location on map which makes it easy for delivery guy to reach the address.On the home page it shows all the offers available at nearby restaurants.You can search for any food or a nearby restaurant and see all the dishes available in that restaurant, all things were sorted and categorised, you hav to just add the food in the cart and proceed to the payment, also some dishes are customizable and almost all nearby restaurant are available on the website.  They have various payment methods like debit card, credit card, all online wallets, food cards, netbanking and cash on delivery, for which you have to have the exact amount with you to be paid, you can link your online wallets which makes payments faster on a click of a button.They introduce new offers and coupon codes regularly on restaurants and payment methods which makes it pocket friendly.  I ordered Noodles from the nearby restaurant and got 50% discount on it after applying the coupon code as said by them and paid through paytm.It notifies you that your order is received by the restaurant and the food is being prepared and appoints delivery executive shortly, it also shows the distance between you and the restaurant on the map you can live track your food on the map which makes it easy when you are busy with some other work.The delivery time is between 30-50 minutes depending upon distance and the restaurant you are ordering from.The delivery guy calls you after he arrives the address mentioned.Overall the service of swiggy is good."
Review on Swiggy.com  Today I shall tell about swiggy. com where we can order any type of dishes which you want to eat. and the best thing which I would like to tell you that is about the fastest delivery of dishes at home from mobile at any time. even I would like to tell you that you can order from your faivorate restaurant. And even you want to eat gulab jamun you can order. And you can check where is the delivery boy is. I was suprised about this website I think if you want to order any dish so you should use this website.  Thanks
Its a very good app because it provide ur very good platform to order food. it gives very great offers daily which help in saving money. but the support system is quite bad because they do not respnd go us quickly. I use this app daily for my use I love this app. this app is great. thankyou for lauching this type of app. I loveyou all
"Swiggy had messed up my order initially but they later made it up by replacing the order and sending fresh food. Even though it took up most of my evening, at the end, I enjoyed some good food. Being Christmas today, apparently there were many orders and therefore my order got mixed up. The chat support in Swiggy worked well and I was able to get my replacement order within a short span of time."
"So it was when I first time ordered from swiggy late night I got a food thats smelling so I called swiggy to help me but they refused to do anything and I have tk sleep hungry because it was too late that no other restaurant would have served me. So I stopped using it. Then later one day I got offer of 50% off so I thought lets give it a try so again I ordered I costed me 120rs and I put the correct delivery address but the delivery man couldnt find my address idk the reason so he refused the delivery and after all this swiggy charged me 75 rs I felt like whats happening I didnt get the food , I wrote right address even after that I wasted my 75 rs for nothing"
When Swiggy was started in mumbai the Customer care the delivery timing and politeness by the delivery boys was well. But after getting popular Each and every thing get dropped and now the customer care the delivery timing and politeness is dropped to lowest level. Still you will find some good people who try to make every thing possible.
"Today I have installed swiggy aap in my mobile phone. This app is different from Zomato, the options are also different. But I have searched for sagar gaire restaurant and place an order. Delivery charges are also are high compare to Zomato and plus packing and taxes charges. My order has been accepted by restaurant and rider has delivered it within the time period. So what's the problem with the app. Yes there is no chat available as on zomato. I only have to call to rider to tell me about direction for my home otherwise I haven't faced any problem. App loading time is also good. User can easily understand how to use the app. User will get all the information related to restaurant, food and orders. So I will recommend to my friends and family.  For proof I will attache the sreenshot of the order."
Swiggy is a food order company which can deliver food at your home and this is a good app I have used this app many times and my review is good and when I have ordered they deliver my order in the given time and good food that so you should try this app and order they will not give any problem to deliver and order and secure app
I delevered some sweets from swiggy and it was very fast only in 10 minutes maybe because it was near me.or traffic wasn't there I don't know the reason but for me it was good to be a part of swiggy .and another day I ordered burger and you will not beleive it it takes just 5 minutes oh my god I really like this app .
Contineously 3 times they delivered in wrong address and not ready to take the blame. there is no co ordination between the team. used to blame it on customer that the issue is from customer side. Its better please take screenshot immediately after placing the order
"I started chatting with Swiggy team and they rudely ended the chat by saying we will make every effort to see that this never happens again. BLAH BLAH.  Food is stale, cold and unwanted ingredients. just wanted to get my money back or replace the item. they said, they would pull up their socks next time.  I would not recommend this app not even for a single pie to buy.  Make sure not to install this app at all and also be assured that this app will make contacts with fake restaurants having bad quality foods, they even do not use quality water in their food dishes."
The only thing that you ed to work is high delivery shared that is applied few times but because of swiggy most of local restaurants understand the importance of Quality food.  Even you want to make changes in your processed order they will do t with a smile on their face.
The delivery boy carried the food in a plastic shopping bag!! Can you believe that!! As a result the food was crushed and STONE COLD!!!! Worst experience ever!!!!!!!! I seriously doubt that I'll ever use them again!!!! I'll play safe and stick to Zomato
"Hey friends,  This is very unfortunate for me to write this negative feedback to you.But I found that u are not providing proper atfention to customer grievences.even your app is not nice.sometimes its cash on delievery option disappeared.even its order coupons are also not very nice.because sometimes it works and sometimes not.also its customer services are not well.That chat agent are also untrained and also they take lot of the time to unsolve the problem .they have not placed the order and when I am trying to call them they didnt even answer our call seems like they are ignoring our call.I reported the swiggy chat team but they are only saying that they are trying to teach the person but they are taking lot of time to reach him.I think they are playing with customer time and money.Also I have noticed that order delievering is late, sometimes even they charge more than the actual price.also one of my friend have ordered roti and paneer sabji and the roti is half uncooked and there was a stone in sabji.seeing all this I am very disappointed .even they take lots of time in delievering .sometimes I feel to order food from other sites.they have a very pathetic customer care services  Thank you"
"I have had multiple experiences with weight where the food is delivered after 2 hours or never delivered at all. If you call the customer service, only answer you get is ""sorry for the inconvenience caused"". It's almost like listening to a recorded message on the phone. No matter how many times you to explain your problems with them, there's no response other than the by hearted one. It's frustrating! Never want to use it"
Actually I've used this aap twice.so there are only two orders which I have placed both the times I have also posted the pictures which I have ordered.Let me discuss this in points that will be more easier to understand  1st order : -  At first I have placed order of a maharaja burger?? which was quite good no compromise in quality super fresh it was loaded with cheese and had two patties in it. which in malls or franchise it costs more than 120 but in swiggy they provide it easily in home services and the price was super affordable the actual price including tax was Rs.99 but after applying coupon it gave me of 50 percent discount which costed me Rs.52.  2nd order : -  In second I have again posted a screenshot but in 2nd order I've ordered full Chowmein and spring roll delivery given on time that was also super affordable at first it was of Rs.99 after applying coupon it costed me Rs.53.Quality was ok ok type not so good not bad.  But only the best thing about the app is it gives 50 percent discount on first five orders compared to other apps we don't had to search coupon code for that.And the 2nd best thing is it gives delivery on minimum orders also.
"Swiggy guy uses abusive language, he pushes the customer, he threatens them. He says that he is local guy and can do anything to them. He doesn't delivers the food and marks them as delivered. His name is parmesh v and his contact no is. 7829646972. The unprofessional behaviour of the delivery raises a serious safety concern for all the customers. They know the location of the customer and they can do anything with their families. This kind of services from a well known company like swiggy is just a example. Their are many more such things that are going unreported. So I think that this should be taken care in priority."
"Swiggy always deliver food on time and it is better than zomato because it gives more discount and provides more coupons qnd promo codes and food is always hot  Swiggy tied up with very high rated restaurants to ensure there quality but on disadvantage of using swiggy is that delivery men are sometimes rude.however, using swiggy is value for money."
"Swiggy and the restaurants like #Bhatinda Express combined cheating the customers by giving bad quality of food and missing the items.  if we ask about this the support team was not helpful in fact will say only Sorry for the in convenience. but no other support from them.  I had very bad experience with Swiggy and Bhatinda Xpress . I have ordered ""Kadai Panner Combo"" this contains roti, naan, julab jam. but I recieved only naan with panner. rest all r missed.  Even there is no good response from the support.  DON'T USE SWIGGY AGAIN"

"Swiggy is Online Order is Simple Way, All Types of Order is Just Now & Sometime Dilevered, Super Dilevered Company On Online Mathoured, Swiggy is Best Product Dilevered, Swiggy Is All Over India Branches is No. 1 Online Food Dilevered Company, All Over Member Online Food Order Through Swiggy & After Sometime Dilevered"
"This is the age when online ordering of food is the buzzword. I downloaded the app with lots of hope, but find it useless in Allahabad. It really work wonderfully well in Delhi and Banglore.  My daughter recommended that you too can use Swiggy service when in no mood to cook.  For the last 15 days I try to search but found nothing worthwhile to order. At times restaurants registered with Swiggy show unable to serve now or put unrealistic minimum order value.  We had enjoyed Swiggy online food ordering in Banglore but in Allahabad it is really poor or you can say useless.  App is user friendly but if it does not serve at maximum popular restaurants than what's the use of being user friendly"
"1) Guys beware of these Fraudsters. It's a humble request .Pls never ever place any orders from them.They r running a Big scam playing with both Consumers Health n Money.They deliver bad quality n Stale food.  2) No Proper Packaging( No Cover) , No Invoice & the worst part is NO SPOON. ( Packaging Charges charged Rs. 24 but delivered food as per attached picture)  Vendor: Faasos  3 ) Most IMP Food Quality/ Taste -Delivering Brinjal Rice & adding Paneer in Paneer Biryani & with ful of sum Flavoured color.  Finally had 2 throw away entire food n slept hungry & when requested for Refund they refused straight away"
It's not very nice but helpful I was installed it for a few days and I got benifit after some time I'll re install this app and I'll again review for you there are some kinds some ads some lag and those all heppens very big problem so I think as a coustmer it's not very nice but nice for unpaid users and we will use it
I have used swiggy almost three to four times to get a good meal. Thus they offer 50% discount on your first 5 orders but they are not improving their food quality standards. I received the food with simple packing that is not expected from swiggy. Taste is also a point to improve. My personal experience was not so good.
One day iam see a advertaisment in tv. That is about swiggy. That swiggy.com. an food delivery online site. One day in my house my friends are came.that time in my house not have food. So iam booked food in swiggy at 1.30. in that time they said food delivey within 30mints. But food deliverd after 2 hr. So this costamer service and delivery too bad. So iam not like this website. That time we can buy on restuarents. In the site main adwantage is all foods are avaialble and foods are buy in deffrent restuarents. But this limitation is too high such that all delivery time is high and delivery charge is high . But food are new and better.
Hello everyone!  Today I am going to talk about swiggy. I feel it as one of the best options for food lovers. There are a lot of best things like they deliver the food in a time period of 35 to 40 mins.  The food is properly packed so it also don't get messed up. Another thing is they give 50 percent discount upto 100 rupees till 5 orders which is too good so whenever me and my friend want to order anything we do it from swiggy as it's much cheaper than going to hotel paying because there is no discount and we don't even need to go and bear petrol expenses too.  Another thing is whenever I am not sure than I order for Cash on delivery and if I have an issue then I easily cancel the order from the app.  The only thing which is not good is if you order something like a shake which is not in much amount or cheaper then it gets costly because its adds a heavy delivery charge so if we have a high in price order then its favourable.  Otherwise it is best.
SWIGGY is very expensive compared to uber eats.Moreover the quatity they offer is also very small.If youve ever ordered through swiggy you will know what im talking about.They charge almost -20-40% extra on top of that they dont give the normal quantity that we get if we directly buy from the shop.Moreover they pay their delivery excecutives very less compared to other brands like uber eats zomato or food panda.When they charge so much why cant the pay a fair price for its excecutives?It is better to order through some other apps.
"I am ashamed to say Swiggy employee are very unprofessional rude.. They do not complete the order without delivering the food physically click on order complete.. The add on provided does not match from where the order is placed.. Like for example, I have ordered for paneer Shawrma and add ons fries but in actual Maroosh does not serve so in the end complete order is not served.. But the price is charged for add one too.. Pathetic service.. N app that does not match restaurant menu due to which complete order is not delivered.. Ridiculous"
"The swiggy is for ordering food in online using computers or in smart phones. I am also a orderer of swiggy. I am ordered pizza, the pizza quantity was low because someone has ate before the delivery. So I call the delivery man but no response, so I gave bad feed back for the service they provide for me but also no response the service is also poor and someone is eating our delivery food items before delivering. So be careful."
"I always prefer swiggy over other online food apps. I have been using this app for almost 4yrs now.but there are few points to be shared!  City criteria:  when I lived in bangalore, their swiggy service was pathetic.in such a big city My experience with swiggy was bad.everytime I order items one or two would not be delivered and when I contact customer care, they just keep me on hold for five minutes and later say that delivery guy tried reaching you bla bla bla! They are lethargic! I disliked Swiggy to the core!  But I need to mention this.now I am living in Hyderabad and the Swiggy service as far as my experience is comcerned, its definitely amazing! I get food before the expected time, no misplace of items which needs an appreciation!  my final verdict:  its defintely a good food app in HYDERABAD.i would recommend this to people living in hyderabad!"
"On my personal experience Swiggy is best, Swiggy delivered the food whenever I hungry ?? so being a working professional I always get the service on time and also if not delivered I use to receive my cash on time where Zomato never responded back. Swiggy is better."
"Most of the time, when we order they deliver wrong product or they give food without sause or spoon or plates. Most painful part is the chat support. Not sure whether it's a bot or human that is interacting on the other end. They keep responding in same tone with copy paste messages.  We keep facing this issue for the last 2 months. Today we have decided to delete our accounts with Swiggy and go with other service providers."
It's worst service till now I experienced when I order on swiggy first of no. Of restaurant serviceable in my area is very low . And after order estimated delivery time shown in app is 25 minutes. But my order is delivered in around 1 hr time taken by him. And best part of swiggy is they delived if we order 1 PCs.
One of the best online ordering food app .The food offered by swiggy is absolutely fantastic and delicious.The waiting time is also just within 20 minutes to 30minutes depending upon the ranges of food offered by the restaurant.The price is also so cheap and its affordable to every sections of the society.
"This swiggy is nothing but a mood spoiler atleast as far as chennai is concerned. They club it with multiple deliveries and reach after an hour and half since you placed the order. So, office people - if you plan to lunch at a time and want to attend a meeting after that, I am sure you will end up attending the meeting without having a meal.  They won't take up your special instructions. Especially, if you are ordering for kids, your instructions will be served the opposite way. I got a hot and spicy pizza for children when I wanted it the other way. And the delivery executive argues that food was not spoiled and why a complaint on this. How mean? Do you even want to deliver spoiled food swiggy?  They have both GPS address and a manual address bar for setting delivery location. I typed the address manually because I couldn't find my grandmother's location in the map as I was in hurry. The crap swiggy app picked my GPS location as I was the one ordering and delivered it to me. I took the packages the another half to deliver it my grandmother.  Swiggy is sure to fire up your day. Please beware."
"The best ever food application I have ever came across. I have tried all other food applications but, swiggy is my personal recommendation to all the foodie. Not only in delhi they cover all the major metros and even deliver fresh and ready to eat food in the neighborhood. The after sales service and customer feedback is what they offer.  They are working on the principal of closely analysing customer buying behaviour and minimising all the discripenses if any occours.  Its been more than a year I am using the application."
"I live in mumbra I ordered masala dhosa through swiggy for my sister, she was in a hurry was going outstation I thought if order from the hotel they will take time or if I order on swiggy they will get my order instantly as I had seen their advertisement on tv that their services are so fast so I ordered and requested my sister to wait for a while for breakfast she waited 20 minutes but we didn't get our dhosa so she went as she was in a hurry then I checked my order it was showing we don't deliver in mumbra at ordering it said your has been dispatched and later on it was showing this so embarrassing moment for me that I could not feed my sister"
"I have never siren such stupid delivery service in India and abroad  Delivery guys does not have common sense of keeping their phone on, had to wait all night for food and still did not get delivered,  Delivery guy are crook and teenagers are smarter than staff,  Really set"
"They have the worst delivery guys and worst customer service, multiple times my order has got cancelled without any reason, many of the times food us getting deliverd late, and the delivery guys are so pathetic and rude and on the names of offer and discounts these guys are making us fool, swiggy has become bad to worst, never ever gonna use this app"
Very bad service and very slow...  I have wait for 1 and 1/2 hr for my order...  I have connected my call to customer care ...then they have given excuses about the same  I will never give Oder via swiggy...and never recommend to anyone...????????????
"Ordered rajma chawal from the swiggy app whicb was at the rate of Rs.250/- . I have also checked on foodpanda, faasos, zomato and many more food ordering apps about the same food item that I ordered from the swiggy app but they were very much expensive, so I went ahead with the swiggy app. I just downloaded the swiggy app on my phone and ordered rajma chawal."
I ordered for 3 Onion kachoris and when I received it had only one. When I called up to complain they are saying they will give 30rs coupon... I paid 82rs after deducting the refund coupon they had given for my previous order... Where the same thing had happened...  We are paying delivery charges als
I had never used Swiggy before in any city and my first experience of using it was here in Bangalore and it was worst experience customer experience I have ever faced  Dear swiggy poor customer support will definitely going to affect your sales numbers. I don't know what the hell kind of startup you guys are building. Zomato and food Panda services are much better than yours.
"Most pathetic Service ever faced by this so called Swiggy. Didn't get my order on time, and also attitude in behavior at customer care.  I will never order from Swiggy in future.  If I could have less than a star rating I would have given that. ??????"
The food which we ordered will be delivered quicly and from a nearest restuarent we choose. The first five orders are free delivery and discounts on fod coupens are more compared with others. It is the best app for ordering food. The min time taken for delivery is20min and max40min depending upon the area.
"I live in noida . I order from burger king one of the delivery guy came named as Salman 9267944102. he took my money and assured me that he'll be back after taking change from shop but he never came . I complaint against him to swiggy customer care but instead of helping me he was covering their delivery person(Salman) and didnot return my money.When I talked to that guy he blamed me tht im liar n he already returned the money but it never happened .  swiggy persons are liars and thieves and their service is also poor  I highly recommend not to order food from them.  whatever happened with ur order and money, management will never help. they will give u excuses only."
This app is just cheating people and they brush off all blames that we are only delivering we dont care about quality of food. The management should know if people are ordering online then they are trusting you people. I have chats with customer care also regarding quality of food.. check that out
"I have waited like more than 1 hour just for an order.The app promised it will be done in 41 minutes then I had to message the swiggy support asking them to fasten up , they then gave the contact of the delivery boy , In the app it said the food was prepared and the delivery boy has departured . But when I called him , he said that the order has not been prepared yet.I was so frustrated and had to wait 20 minutes more than the promised time.  I have ordered a combo of pepsi , schezhwan noodles and chilli chicken.When I recieved the combo I got 7up instead of pepsi , when I enwuired about this too the delivery boy then he said that only cool drink available was 7up.I was cheated again with the quantity of the food they gave . I visited the restaurent and ordered the same , and I got more quantity and seriously the price was just 150 and in swiggy it showed 189/- .  The packing was worst , I had to eat the chillichicken which was spilled on the cutlery . Worst experience with swiggy.  I Raised these issue with the swiggy support and I even complained them on customer care and I never got a posative reply today.  Please guys better you all go and visit a hotel to eat , these apps are worthless."
The delivery executive left the order to main gate security guard. Security guard suggested him to go to other gate as this gate was closed at night. He just left the order and marked it delivered. When I called him he said I have other orders as well. One of the worst service by swiggy. There are far better options available where atleast you will get the food. Uninstalling app and stop using the service.
"Swiggy took a order for 180 and delivered food worth of 105 with other items missing. When contacted customer care, they agreed their mistake and offered to refund maximum of 30. Even on their mistake of 75 customer care was arguing 30 is best they can do and its fair."
"Not only did the service delay like crazy but also Swiggy Customer care did not care - all they had to say was ""we'll try to see it does not happen next time"". Plus they blamed me for the screw up when the delivery boy clearly told me that the fault was at Swiggy's end.  Why stick to one service when there are other options in the market?"
So guys today I used a website which is swiggy.com so this is very popular food website but it is only a illusion because it is too costly website we cant get food from this website in cheap price. It takes high price for delivery of any food. And delivery is not a fast delivery. But in ads they are saying that super fast delivery but in real they take a long time of delevered the food due to which the temperature of food may change and its effect on the taste of any food. and its delivery is not available at my place which is old seemapuri so I hope they will improve their faults
I have ordered food through Swiggy at 10.20 pm.Around 11.30 got a call from delivery boy that he won't be able to deliver the food due to some issue with Nike..After follow up with customer care my delivery was assigned to some other executive and again I got a message at 12.10 am that my order is cancelle
I order on swiggy they take my rupees and then i saw that my order is missing and they give no response they even dont talk with manager very bad response from swiggy i never place any order now on swiggy even they dont take our order on time order id no is 268434411
"Very bad experience with, tried 2-3 times and every time they have an excuse of late delivery of around 1-1.5 hrs. Ithought it may one of the incident but evwry time it’s the same. They can’t match customer’s orders, not going to order on swiggy from now on, zomato is much better."
Since I gave a feedback about what happened to me regarding my order .The escalation department calls and says the cancellation fee will be refunded as it was a delay from the delivery person and gave me the reference number of refund initiation as 20181202111212801300168320214822646...I waited for the refund but the executive in the chat just regretted for the inconvenience!woww nice service .They show that the cancelled order is delivered but claim that they changed the status ..claps!
"At first while ordering it showed they will deliver in 29 minutes, but they delivered after 65minutes. Still some items are missed, for which options they gave are ""I can wait again 65 minutes orelse I can give a feedback"" but they won't refund any amount."
"I PLACED ORDER FOR 2 MEAL FEW MINUTES BEFORE, THEY DELIVERED ONLY 1 MEAL.I HAVE TAKEN OPEN DELIVERY INFRONT OF DELIVERY PERSON.CUSTOMER CARE IS DENYING TO RETURN MY MONEY. INTENSIONALY DELIVERING HALF AND CHEATING CUSTOMER'S MONEY.. Delivery guy is also a thief.. THIS IS 2nd time i a. facing this issue.. they are intensionaly doing it to cheat money... BEWARE OF SWIGGY."
These guys know how to perfectly con a customer. I had ordered from The Bowl Company Hyderabad which was a Swiggy assured order stating that if I do not get delivery within 30 mins the amount would be refunded. I got the order after 50 mins and I called these guys up stating the same. They conveniently started lying that it is not a Swiggy Assured outlet. I then sent a screenshot with the proof that it is on their chat and after 15 mins they abruptly end conversation stating that the issue is resolved. I again called them up and they refused to acknowledge again. How can somebody so blatantly cheat customers? Who do they think they are ? I have deleted the app and will never ever order or let anyone from my family order through Swiggy. Bunch of complete crooks.
"It was there server's fault and the delivery guy talks so rudely as if he is doing some god's work. Never using swiggy again, real bad experience. You enter ur location but there server will automatically take some other location which u already have saved in ur account, and then they will just cancel ur order and leave you hungry."
"On 28th of this month I have ordered 1 bbq and 1 chicken fried rice with mushroom chilli from 12 to 12 barbe que at palarivattom. Actually 12 to 12 is a reputed restaurant but the food delivered not so good. the packing and all was very careless. swiggy representatives should take care of the packing and all. I was disappointed when I got the food. the time was 9 pm and also I was too much hungry, o didnt find other way."
"Swiggy has become careless now. On multiple occasions, the live tracker showed incorrect info. Twice my order was cancelled in the last 2 weeks citing stupid reasons. Customer support is worst, they give excuses thinking that customers are idiots. I tried using a coupon code last week and the order was not delivered."
Auto location detector has set wrong address. it is not set a exact location address. so the delivery executives get a trouble for time delivery.  Auto location detector has set wrong address. it is not set a exact location address. so the delivery executives get a trouble for time delivery.
"On 1st Nov 2018, I ordered food from a restaurant 2kms away from my house. Unfortunately paid online Rs.670 also. I got a message that order will be delivered in 27minutes...and never happened at all. Now from past 1 month I am requesting them to refund the money and every time there is a new person to chat and every person reads the chat message and tells me that money will be refunded in another 2 -3 days. Till now it has not been done. It's like begging for your own money. Never order from swiggy and if you do atleast never pay them before your order is delivered like how I did. They are big time cheaters"
"Pathetic service. worst food. I order my food at 1 and I received the order after 3.dont ever use this app.  it's waste of time and money.  food was too sour.  I ordered, Chicken Barbeque but it's Worst and it's not cooked properly.management was really poor."
"Well I use this service in my mobile app.There biggest con is that they provide you less number of Hotels, restro, cafe etc in compare of other delivering services.While they deliver food on time or sometimes before time.There advantage is that they allow you to pay through Amazon pay and also you can apply coupons on cash of delivering payment method, most of the don't have this feature.Even you can find more offers on this as compared to others but you should have to compare with your favorite hotels because of less number.  Thankyou"
Ordered a Big scoop of ice cream from Cream stone but to my utter disappointment found a small scoop of ice cream for the price of large one. The prices do not match the actual prices of the restaurant. On inquiring they do not try to help at all and blame it on the system. Prices are put only to cheat customers and are not the true prices.
"This is from a personal experience, I ordered a meal from a restaurant when I received it and open it, it was only half the meal, I was shocked I tried calling swiggy customer care they say they can't do anything in it and they can't refund the amount I was furious so I tweeted about it, on twitter my problem got resolved so why there is customer care when they can't do anything, otherwise all other things are great and I must say that restaurant try to cheat swiggy by sending only half meals so they must also ensure about the quality and quantity of the food."
"Firstly, I say that swiggy is my most favourite food serving app.  I had order sweets from surat famous sweet shop. And I got my food package at on time no delay.  Even swiggy also accept cash payment on discount offer.  Till now I order 20-30 times but I m not disappoint any time of their services.  I recommend to my friends to use swiggy."

"It seems like swiggy thinks to acquire this industry in India is way easy for them just to provide an app and everybody will be happy.  they do not consider delivery, communication, good restaurant and charges also played an important role in this.  Delivery charges were way more than expected, almost 25-30% of orders they charge and price on their app is already added few bugs to fool people.  Do not happy with them(Anger)"
"Dear Swiggy,  This is very unfortunate for me to write this feedback to you.  I found very pathetic and unprofessional way to handle customer for your executives.  Request you to please hire some executives with good etiquette.  They should not teach us to keep change at home.  For 270/- have given 500 and got reply that we don't have change, you should keep change at home.  The same reply we got from customer care executive!  Hoping to see your positive action on this  Regards  Very upset customer"
"One of the Swiggy delivery executive named, Senthil Rajasekaran is simply superb. Even though the mistake is with the restaurant guys, he helped me to bring the order again without any regrets. The company should reward him in some way. Employees of this kind are very less now-a-days. So he should be recognized."
"We ordered Pizza on Swiggy from Pizza Hut. After taking the order, we were told that Pizza will be delivered in about 40 min and we eagerly waited to have Pizza party at home with kids.  While online status kept on showing that Pizza will be delivered on time, we got the call on mobile from Swiggy delivery guy that order has not been received by Pizza Hut from Swiggy and he himself was not able to reach Swiggy. Pizza hut won't listen to him and discussion went on for 90 min. Neither us nor swiggy delivery guys was attended to by Swiggy.  We were frustrated and had to cancel the order and arrange for the alternative food, after wasting 2 hours .  We wrote back to Swiggy and there has not been any response so far. There is no way to talk to them(even for their own delivery guys) and no way to expect a response on a mis-adventure.  We have decided to never use SWIGGY. but wanted to share the experience so that reality comes out and we become more vigilant as customers!"
"Malpratice occur in every business Swiggy is involved in the time of billing .  Yesterday night, I ordered from wellknown restaurant of vododara and then issue is started . I have attached the screenshots . In the swiggy app the pav bhaji is 71 rupee but actuall price is 95 rupees .  The pav bhaji is priced at 95× 3 instead of 71 . Same is the case of chole kulcha .  They have actually billed at the price that is striked off instead of their discounted price .  This comes a total of 285+ 95( chole) = 380  The actual billing should be 71× 3 ( pav bhaji) + 71× 1 ( chole kulcha)  This comes total of twenty hundred eighty four ( 284) .  On this amount , this has to be charged .  So, it would have maximum 300 rupees and on applying coupon of GRAB50 . It would have been 150 rupees to be paid .  Also , I have attaching the image and I have received as the reciept for the order from delivery boy .  The image of bill does not mention the amount , disscount and GST anything .  It is upto us how to take bill as,  One would say , this is not a big difference but the reality is these are gimmicks to make you fool and think this is not a big thing .  Think upon if the order would have been of price then It would be a matter .  I did not face like this anything in other app . They had propper billing from the restaurant .  The pav Bhaji was raw one with butter less applied and same was in the chole kulcha .  SWIGGY, you have just started opening in vododara and such would affect your sales .  They told they will into the matter and have the given the same coupon as worth of food .  I hope they work on the issues . .  Thank you."
"On 21st Nov 2018 , I have placed an order from swiggy app , by default my office address was selected in app , and I have done online payment for this order , in app there was no any option to change address, then within 2 minutes I have informed to their support team , they were not ready to help and were closing chat that was done many times, and my actual address was near to my office but they didn't heleped for it and hold it for long time till the order got delivered on wrong address.it is clear that they duped me .because that order was only confirmed i informed them at that time they were able to help me but they didn'tbecause these guys have made there business to dupe customers.They make there customers helpless I was feeling like same at that time.i will recommend everyone not to use swiggy app ."
This mobile application is very useful to us. It contains all restaurant in cities. If we need food urgently means we can search in this application and we can get the food immediately. I love this application only because we can get good immediate wherever we need. This can deliver to our home so I love this application
I ordered pizza from swiggy and receive what even animal wouldn't eat. Attached pic.  There delivery boy handover food like its a piece of shut. And no way to complaint about it. Will never use it again. Previously too they delivered half or wrong order
Zomato is far better guys trust me!!! This guys r getting rich for doing nthing. Delete this idiots. After paying ths much money we getting POOR Services. Only process is easy to place an order. Otherwise they r very bad. U will understand once u feel. I m going out at 12:25 IST to find food for my son!
Great experienceI started using this app from last 6 months. I liked the service even in night time. This is the one of the best online food delivery app from morning 08: 00 PM to Late night 02: 00 AM with tracking facility and lot of restaurants you will get to know in your surroundings. Once you order Placed you will get the delivery executive number so easy to communicate and they will delivered food on time and it will be fresh and one of the good thing is customer service promptness in response and refund in case of delivery failure.
"They cant manage the APP for the technicaly not strong and they are unable to update the address for the delivery guys .kindly make upfated for delivery because delivery boys are facing lot of issues for the delivery thing . pls take care of your appn developing and managing and upadting, I am facing frequently issue from swiggy for the address ."
"Very good customer service from swiggy. Really really disappointed. Never try to order any food from swiggy. The people are harsh enough to reply at my experience, when my ordered been cancelled I came to know onlyafter an hour time. Don't cheat people like giving best service. I tried customer care too . The result will be the same. They forget the motto , customer first . I have been trying to track my order for the last 3 hours. Never ever try to book swiggy, my humble request"
"I have always been using the swiggy since the day I came to know about it and it has been the boon for people like me who like to eat at odd hrs. In those situations comes those “ no less then red caped heroes who vanquishes the evil of hunger with a thank you and a smile”  Irrespective of the time, I have always got the delivery as per my specifications and in some special orders they have deliverd it real quick.  Though some times it becomes pain to get the food due to the irresponsible behavior of restaurant or may be due to the delivery guy. But still due to the chat options available in the swiggy app, I have been able to resolve all my issues and queries."
"Had ordered a veg penne pasta and they delivered chicken. I am pure vegetarian and I ended up eating chicken because of wrong delivery. They are so careless even when I called the customer executive. Though they refunded the money, it's more to do with my belief. This is the second time it's happening to me with swiggy. Will never order from swiggy again"
Last few days I I am using swiggy . Swiggy is the food delivery app . This app is installed by phone . I an living in a bardgon and I have tight schedule of my work always I prefer food delivered to my office . There are sa many hotals are liasted .  App always give 50% offers to new coustomers for first 5 orders it Will give 100rs discount on each order . Most of the food items are in under price .  The deliver time is 35 to 45 min . I hope you use this app and take advantage of this app .  Thank you
This is one of the best delivery app in india and one of the fastest delivery app.It gives more cashback and they give the best offers in any foodcorners.it gives three( 3) coupons in first three orders.it gives the order location on your map.It suggest all local hotels and restaurants . specially it gives all ratings and reviews
Very bad experience for swiggy. They have cancel my order without my parmission and their executive was very bad and have so much of ego that he cant wait for 2 min. Dont order to swiggy any more  Using very bas language. Its good to order on zomato....
"IT IS A DISGUSTING, USELESS AND TIME WASTING SERVICE. I HAVE DOWNLOADED THE APP AND TRIED TO ORDER FOOD, BUT THEY DIDN'T ALLOW ME TO PLACE THE ORDER. INSTEAD THEY SENT ME A MSG SAYING THAT MY ORDER WAS NOT COMPLETED. AND IT WILL TAKE THEM UPTO 15 MINUTES. SO I HAVE WAITED FOR MORE THAN 2 HOURS, BUT NO USE. SO I TRIED CALLING THEM THRICE, BUT THERE WERE NO RESPONSE FROM THEIR SIDE. VERY VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. I DID WRONG THING BY INSTALLING THE APP. WASTE OF TIME."
"They sent me a nonveg burger instead of veg burger and on complaint neither refund nor exchange! Horrible never order from swiggy, worst app ever! Worst service ever! Itna bakwaaas service aaj tak kahin nai hoga  Pehla toh galat burger upar se no issue solving also  if youll want wrong orders and no service, go for swiggy"
"For the third time, items were missing from my order placed yesterday. When contacted the CC guy(with userid ""k_rahul"") mentioned he cannot refund as his system does not allow him to do so! All he is authorized is to send an email to his higher ups! I DM'ed them my order number Order #25537996278 and still no reply even to that.  This company will shut down soon with the sort of reviews one reads. If you are an investor get out quick."
Delivery very poor.....riders deliver incomplete order......customer care poor........my suggestion always check your delivered items before payment........my experience worse...despite their riders fault they don't refund ur money....I was not delivered complete order and neither refund .....customer care is just there to say sorry.......
"UNPROFESSIONAL    I received the wrong items in the order and nothing was done about it except forwarding my feedback to the restaurant.     Whats all this technology for if you can't convey the message right?  IGNORANT    The customer support is good for nothing! Super slow replies, they have a fixed chat which they copy past, ""i understand your concern"" ""our system isn't allowing us to compensate you ate the moment""     I mean what he hell? Did I complain to get a sorry from your customer care? Seriously! what psychology do  UNSAFE  Most unhygienic riders and actually this has happened twice that the guy who came to deliver the order was a relative/friend of the guy who is actually supposed to deliver. Never wear any Icards or swiggy authentication t shirts. This one particular delivery guy was so spooky, tried to get inside even after telling him to stay outside. I literally had to shut the gate on his face forcefully."
Worst app i transfer my payment via neft but no delivery.and i callad at the support but no answer and restaurent denied my order......not recommandad and so many time i heard that swiggy is best but not its wrong worst app worst app worst app worst app
"IN MY OPINION:  Swiggy is among one of the online food ordering application for all those who are a BIG FOODIE ! It has given the ease to order your food from the comfort of your home/workplace/other providing you with some exciting offers on a daily basis. The offers may vary from restaurant to restaurant apart from what Swiggy might personally offer you and the offers available from a third-party site( s) .  Today, I will be sharing by honest view about Swiggy with all of you. I'm writing this review after experiencing it from last 2 months. So here we go.  CONCEPT:  The concept is absolutely brilliant since you can now enjoy your favorite, delicious and mouth-watering dishes wherever and whenever you want. Also, you can avail discounts if you have any, and save some money including cashbacks and other relevant offers.  No offers are permanent. They may vary all the time.  LAYOUT AND DESIGN:  The overall layout and design of the application is very good. Its simplicity is what makes it look attractive.  FEATURES/FUNCTIONS:  The functionality of the application is user-friendly in nature. Anyone can handle it with ease, nothing complicated in it.  USEFULNESS:  As I mentioned earlier, this app is highly beneficial for people who love food since they can order their food and drinks with just a click!  CUSTOMER SUPPORT:  I'm really very much disappointed with their customer support. The associate( s) sometimes are rude in their talks. Sometimes, the wait time is quite longer than expected, and sometimes they just don't respond to you.  In every online business, the customer service is always the primary backbone and this is where Swiggy is behind by all means.  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Customer care team needs more training on how to handle customers smoothly.  Delivery boy should be wearing the Swiggy shirt while delivering the order and not any other informal dress.  PACKING OF FOOD AND DELIVERY:  The food is delivered on time ( 30-35 minutes) . The packing is also very good. No spilling of food or drinks.  MY RATING:  3.5/5"
They cancelled the order without my permission. And also the customer care guy disconnected the call on my face. Horrible service. Uninstalling the app now. I am gonna upload the screenshot publically. You guys should shut down. They didn't even provide me with options and directly cancelled .
"I have planned an order, it took 20 min to get confirmed. Bloody they have charged 75 Rs for cancellation. This is ridiculous and they charged for not doing anything.  Hence this is my first order from swiggy.  If you want to serve really don't play these cheep tricks to make money"
"Worst GPS system  Worst customer service  No proper communication  Easily said we cancelled your order  order id 25043140060 cancelled by customer care, deliver to be done few steps a head were GPS has tracked behind the building  informed the delivery guy about the issue and said him to come in front of the building were he said he cant would like to inform not to use this app when you have limited time if you have enough time sit back and order"
The shitiest service ever.Just plays with humans and not even a little responsibile. Please don't play with us.They are just money minded.Just had to wait for these people for long hours and they don't even respond. they don't have discipline and responsibility
"Order #24998550722  I ordered in Swiggy and Swiggy cancelled the order after two hours. Though they delivered twice previously in same address, the excuse they give this time is that the delivery boy is unable to find the address! Moreover, the customer care gal is so irritating, I wish I could talk to a chatbot instead of her.  It seems that the delivery boy is not properly paid.  This shows clearly that the downfall of Swiggy is started and business value can not be created by dissatisfying the hungry customer and exploiting the delivery Boyz. It is high time for Swiggy to take proper steps to rectify their business defects. As Indian, I still wish for their success."
Swiggy is a food delivery app. I installed this app just a week ago.I am living in trivandrum and the tight schedule of my work always I prefer food delivery to my office.There are so many hotels are listed in this app.but most of the time there was no hotels in service.i have tried 3 days for ordering food.atlast I deleted this app.This app also giving 50% offers to new customer for their first 5 orders.but most of the food item was over priced. I know exactly the cost of food in some hotels.nothing more to say.
Today we ordered 3 things from swiggy. Out of which 2 were stale. Giving bad smell. We complained but to our shock we were told sorry we cant do any thing we will see in future we will take Care. No return nothing. Better not to use swiggy. Please sleep hungy than to eat this type of stale food. All my 360 rs got wasted??
"This is a great app that works flawless and almost round the clock, except for once or twice I never had any concerns with this. And the team always gets you the customised order and are experts in that area. Yes, the executives are absolutely and completely dedicated because I myself experienced it quite a good number of times. Most importantly, most of the times these people deliver food on time."
"Online cheaters - swiggy.com  I had ordered 3 sets of juices from one of the restaurant and had mentioned the order very correctly that the address is different and I want to connect the person for correct delivery - unfortunately I made online payment and they deducted my money and said that it is a fees - it's a sheer fraud with customers and after mostly a long call with swigy call center being too rude to me the operator said that he can not help me with anything.  Extremely disappointing service and cheaters, fraud- swiggy.com  After that, they have discarded my location and all the orders were showing out of location even the place was hardly a kilometre from my place of order.  Sheer cheaters and thugs... Online thugs.  Never Believe them"
I Am continues dropping mail and calls to became partner with swiggy but no response after multiple calls .  That's how u people are don't bother any new restaurant person  why you people are doing marketing if you do not have more space for new on boarding shops
We ordered some food from nearby restaurant and when it arrived the delivery guy wanted us to pay exact change we even offered to pay near round up of 100’s for which as well the guy dint have change. So we had to cancel the order and they  even charged 75 ₹ cancellation charge which was not our fault aswell. Wouldnt be using them nor would recommend them to anyone  Today aswell we dint get the order till an hour late
Not a good food ordering app this app dont have service in my area.i have just ordering pizza online from this application and this shows no service available in your area.by the way this app is user friendly not saying worst but below average this seems to be understandable by people buying food online.
I am unhappy to give even a single star for you.. The worst service that I have ever seen.. No refund on time... Sorry.. No refund at all... Such a bloody team.. You people don't know even a value of single rupee.. And tell us to cancel the order... Most terrible app.. Karma will follow you soon
"I ordered two packets of biryani from shiraz golden restaurant yesterday. The order number being 24586547365. The order was delivered to me at 19.37 pm and i paid cash to the delivery boy.  When i opened the box after couple of hours for dinner, i was shocked to see that there was no mutton piece in both the boxes of mutton biryani which i recieved from swiggy. There was only one bone, one potato and rice in one packet and the other packet had only one piece potato and rice. Apart from that the food was stinking and could not be eaten.  One simple question, if you guys need money as aid and alms, why dont you people contact an NGO or sit on the streets and start begging !!! This could give you better earnings rather than fooling the customers. I have been humiliated by you people, because of this my guests left my place without having dinner.  I need an explanation and a detailed enquiry. I promise you one thing, I will not sit quite. Will take this matter to consumer forum and way beyond. Revert on an urgent basis."
"I have placed an order on Oct 24, 2018 via my debit card. Swiggy had cancelled my order since there came a sudden shortage for that food item. I was informed about the refund via email on Oct 25, please refer the attachment. In email, they have stated that the refund will happen within 5-7 business days. But refund did not happen till date. When I replied to their email, I got a message that the email address could not be found, please refer the attachment.  I don't find them as professionals for this reason."
"I was surprised by my experience with swiggy. me and my son ordered food through swiggy, we waited for more than 45 minutes and all of sudden we are informed through message that our order is cancelled. according to swiggy we should get a call from delivery boy regarding confirmation of order. we have not received a single call. on calling the delivery boy several times he told us that, ""i cant help, I am on my way to return your food, its a system generated cancellation""."
"Tomorrow I ordered food at 11 PM from a restaurant which is nearly about 3 to 4 km. Ordered was confirmed by the restaurant. After 1 and a half hour later the delivery boy called me that he is unable to find my location. I told him to follow his google map he said ok. Then after an hour when he didn't call me I called him back to know about his status. He told me ""mam I am unable to find your location so I am going to cancel your order. Then a notification popped up on my phone that my food is delivered. I got shocked what is this service?!  Then I called Swiggy customer care and told the customer care executive about the whole scenario. He apologized to me and told me he is unable to reach the delivery boy so I have to cancel the order and it will be refunded. After all this inconvenience I have to order once more time.  This is beyond the expectation, that one sorry cannot refund my time that I have to spend on these things. What I expected and what I perceived from Swiggy is way different. I ordered earlier also from Swiggy but this kind of service always upset the customer. There is service design gap in this whole scenario."
"Pizza has always been special for me and getting dominos pizza at door step is something you feel so good. Apart from pizza I really liked your service, great job of your delivery guys and it was just hassle free. Would like to connect with swiggy again.  Had a great time!!"
"Hello everyone,  I am using swiggy from past one years and my experience with swiggy is awesome, they delivers the food within 30 mins after ordering.  swiggy also gives amazing offers on your first order and later on some cash back when you pay from debit/credit cards.  delivery charge is less and sometimes delivery is free also.  It actually scans your location and then accordingly it will provide you the neighbouring restaurants and hotels from where you can order your stuff. Recently I ordered from'Chinese Delights' restaurant and the food was tasty and delivered within 30 mins also I found that delivery-boy behaved very well and professional.  I will suggest to use this app once."
I am feeling cheated by swiggy.....as I ordered one item of subway from swiggy with 3 months free delivery service cost of 129/- . That subway is 5mints away from me but that delivery executive took 1hr...to reach the restaurant...and deliver the item...final I opened the box look like it was prepared 1 hr earlier..it was taste less...and became something that I didn't expected...worst delivery service....
I made an order which was paid through paytm and I was deducted twice for the same order and wen I tried contacting paytm they clearly said it was swiggys fault and when I contacted Swiggy through chat there were so executives attending the chat and asking me to repeat the whole story again again and also they left the chat abruptly leaving me disappointed without solution  I need my money back it’s been 4 four days already . Never ever order in Swiggy...
"Have been trying to follow up for my double payment query since three days, first of all there is no specific option to call, whn u call there is automated response there is no order on ur registered order on this number, they have an option to chat, where again an automated response that call back after two hours, have sent screen shots of the double payment and everything all proofs but no response, such an pathetic app"
Well I've only used this app once when my grandfather wanted to have Sweets . Quality and service of this app is to be said as good because they qre working very hard to live up to customer's expectations. And it can be said that they managed to do so.  If I talk about service and support then it is as good as Any other online goods delivering service.
"I AM RASING A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPLAIN AGAINST SWIGGY FOR DELIVERING BAD FOOD WHEN THE CUSTMOER ORDER IN NIGHT, I HAD MY OWN EXPERIENCE, THIS IS THE 4TH TIME THE THINGS HAPPENNED,  I have all the valid proof, how could you hire worst restaurants to deliver food who dont know how to pack and how to make good food, Swiggy I feel looted from you guys, Shame on you!"
"From the order delivery to your customer care service everything is worst, better to opt for Zomato instead of wasting your time with them.  They are not caring about their customers, lots of mismanagement.  I will never recommend Swiggy this is my second bad experience with them."
"I placed order(Order no:24391448218) for more than Rs.1250 and they did not provide a cash on Delivery option. After online payment the status says ""Order waiting for confirmation"" for a long time. After calling the helpdesk, they cooly says payment has failed and payment will get credited after 6-7 days. Pathetic! How can they hold my money for 6-7 days?"
Swiggy is fake... Not refunded my money in many a times. I lost so much amount. Zomatto is good. They refund immediately. And less cost of food while compare to swiggy. And I gave 3 star only because it's mandatory to give 3 stars to post my comment.
Swiggy is the worldwide food delivery brand but it is unfortunately being said that it consist a lot of delivery charges that a consumer think twice before ordering any food delivery.  I just don't know that for what purposes these foolish companies are taking so much delivery charges if they are in laws than they should not provide such offers on food delivery but at least don't charge delivery charges with consumers.
"I had an amazing experience with Swiggy, I am a satisfied customer of yours and I always feel great to order food from swiggy.Thanks for this amazing service provided by your company. A must recom- mended app to everyone. Once I had one of my items undelivered and I complained about the same to swiggy and the item was delivered within 15 mins without any extra charges. Happy with your service."
I have good experience with this company . once I will given a order for some fast food when I see the service of this company was very fast . Just in 15 minutes my order is complete and in my hand . So. I will given rating 3 star for this service . I don't know about management of this company .

"We usually orders foods from outside during the weekends .  I do remember last week on october 26th .friday we ordered the food at night around 10 pm from restaurant and the delivery person took around 1 hrs to find my home.we called him around 10 times asking where are you?.  Finally around 11:30 he called that Bhaiya my bike got puncture can you come to collect the food, It was around 2 kms from my home .How can anybody walk 2kms at night 11:30 for the food.  So we called the resturant but no one picked the call.  At last we prepared Maggy and spent the night.  Damm money even not returned back to acccount yet."
"Very pathetic service; no empathy at all. its the worse food app I have ever seen. Please, guys, don't fall for this stupid app which only wastes your money and time.  My experience: 1. they delivered spoiled food when I complain they blocked my account.  2nd time I ordered a food at 11 pm, and by 12:40 am service guy calls and tells that the restaurant has closed and asks me to place an order from another restaurant.  you can go for Foodpanda, is a very good app if you experience any inconvenience they will act to it and make it up to you."
"Even after clear instruction to come with change as have no change or paytm available, the delivery executive shows up with no change and asks me to do paytm even though I clearly wrote that there is no paytm available. When I point that out, he gets rude and takes the order back and says will come back later. I keep waiting and then on the portal I see my order has been cancelled. When I inquire why, I am told that I now have to pay Rs.81 as cancellation fees. I never cancelled my order, infact was waiting for it as I was hungry and to my shock swiggy not only cancels that order on their own but even tries to extort money from me for cancellation, which I never did. This is not the first time, swiggy cancels orders without information and the delivery executives try not to give you exact change as they want forced delivery tip. This is not fair practice. If they do not have change they should simply not accept the order or advice before making you wait and then showing up with no change and being rude. I think this is not fair to make someone wait for food and then not deliver and worst -even try and charge them for not delivering.are you serious?"
The quality of food that they are providing is worst and nobody is taking charge for the same.  Also they are compensating the food quality with Rs 75 and told that nothing can be done much. also they have sent the food totally frozen which was physically visible but the swiggy boy also gave us without checking and now not taking any responsibility for the same.
"Dear Concerned,  In regards to my order(#24166317987) through Swiggy from India Garden Restaurant which was made at 10:20 PM .  It was very much disappointed that I did not get a food delivery and your entire team was giving me illogical excuses and reasons of cancelling the order which made me embarrassed in-front of my family and guests too. Initially, I got a call from delivery executive stating that the above said restaurant would not be able to provide one food out of all my number of quantity. When I put him to replace the same with some other, he asked me to call to customer care number or cancel the order. Post which I called on 080-46800190 and one of the executive told me that order replacement would not be possible as restaurant got closed. After couple of minutes, I received a call from 040-68160400, 040-68149100, 040-68160300 & 040-71816000, wherein I was informed that I have cancelled the order. When I denied on this and told him that as per your customer care executive information the restaurant was closed, than your delivery executive upfront gave some other reason to me that my locality falls under Black Zone area due to which he was unable to order the food and this conversation happened during on conference call and also he was requesting us for not to reject him. Your both the executives were unable to give me the proper reason why the food was not being delivered to me. After one hour of my order, i.e. at around 12, again one of your executive called me to inform to re-order the food from any other restaurant and by this all my family members slept without having any food. Also, meantime I was on online chat with one of your executive, repeatedly texting me that due to technical issue it had happened. I was really shocked that so big and reputed company can have technical issue while ordering the food where every customer would faith on you and order the same hoping that they would receive the same to enjoy and have it. And moreover, you guys are so shameless to inform this to customers that you cannot take my order or replace my order to compensate the same. Moreover, if any food is not available in that particular restaurant and if my place of delivery falls under black zone than why we as a customers are allowed to order the same.  As a foodie customer, I might not know your policies related to the whole process of ordering till delivery but I believe it won’t be against your customers’ satisfaction and their necessity when it is required that is reason they are ordering the same through you guys.  However, whenever I usually order my food from FOODPANDA.COM and whenever I faced this situation, they have always replaced or ordered my order on my behalf rather than giving all bull-shits reason.  This was really a pathetic service I have ever experienced till now. Also, related to refund, please keep that paid amount with you guys as now it’s of no use for me now and it didn’t give any worth to me when it was required.  Lastly, I will make sure that I and any one from my family would never ever any food through your portal.  Thanks for your Service."
"I placed an order today and they called me one hour after my order was placed and said everything I ordered was not available, However the app showed that the driver was waiting for pick up. They then call me and say do you want to cancel the order. I said no I want the order and they state that if you don't cancel the order the driver will still be waiting there.  Worst service ever"
I was very disappointed with the swiggy services. My order was two hours late. Poor service. Swiggy always do this kind of silly things. Worst experience with swiggy. Never ordered again with swiggy. And Uu guys also never ordered from swiggy. They always deliveres the order late
Swiggy is local food delivery app. Now Swiggy available in many cities. User interface is very nice and user friendly. Users can crate account and use easily by only mobile number. delivery time is very good. Users can track real time food delivery. Food Price is satisfactory and provides many cashback options. Here you can pay by debit/credit cards/wallets or cash on delivery. load time of app is very less.
"Worst fry chicken Biryani ever had.  I ordered from swiggy fry chicken Biryani, they give only one piece of chicken and that was also not fried and salad, raita are missing a I take a screenshot and complaint both will not concern my issue they told I can't do anything. It's  Worst and don't ordered from swiggy because they didn't concern issue as well as restaurant."

"We had ordered from Das Khaman through ""SWIGGY"" wherein in ""special instructions"" section we asked for paper dishes, spoon and tissue paper. Even after special instructions they did not follow a single thing.  If they don't follow special instruction, what's the point in keeping that option."
"Delivery Boys of SWIGGY doesn't have manners and the way how they drive bikes by breaking all TRAFFIC Rules, which in-turn have made an accident with my vehicle and injured me badly.  I understand that the Delivery Time of the order is priority, which doesn't mean that they will break all the traffic rules and regulations and injure the general public by coming on wrong routes. Above all, they start arguing and when I said to wait the SWIGGY Delivery Boy ran away from the spot.  Seriously, when I spoke with my friends/colleagues regarding the incident, they had the same opinion that nowadays SWIGGY Delivery Boys drive bikes as if they are the KING and doesn't care of the general public/human being even though they have hurted/injured anyone.  SWIGGY MANAGEMENT HAS TO TAKE SOME ACTIONS RATHER IGNORING THE GENERAL PUBLIC."
"The experience with swiggy has been good before, but they delivered a couple of pizzas today which was unacceptable..the cheese margherita and a chicken pizza were delivered upside down with everything crumbled and stuck to each other. They need to educate their delivery ppl how to deliver pizzas."
"I had ordered for pizza fromswiggi .But I got all life bad experience . Since it was 1 hrs as my ordered was not getting delivered , I tried contacting them then they said that my ordered got cancelled.what type of service is this ? If you cannot value the time and the customer .How can you expect a good business in the market.Worst service and worst app."
There are certain coupon codes on Swiggy App but when you apply it always shows not applicable why?  And when the same was asked to the Cc team they said they have no idea abt this like seriously  You have certain coupons to be availed by us under certain things even Aftr that it shows not applicable you seriously need to find an answer for this
"I like to share my first experience on swiggy, My order No. 23640927996,  Dated: 26/10/2018  1.This is my first experience on your app, I always order on Zomato which hundred times better than your app, your app without my permission automatically debit the amount from my Paytm wallet.    When I tried to link my Paytm wallet to your App automatically debited amount from Paytm wallet without giving opportunity to apply promo code.     3.Food late delivered.  4.Food tatste and quality is very bad.  5.Food Delivered without Bill.    Price, Taxes and Delivery charges is very high when compare to Zomato.     7.When I tried to call the delivery boy it was respond that all lines are busy or it can't be reach now,  I tried for 15 times in 30 Minutes.  This my First and wrost experience"
"Its a Fraudulent cheaters company! They alter food item rates to their convenient profitable prices than the actual restaurants or sweets shops prices!  I have purchased various sweets from a sweet shop through swiggy several times, today I have visited the shop in person and purchased 1700/- worth items, then only I come to know that this fraud swiggy is collecting excess money so, I have added the all items in swiggy from the same sweets shop then the final bill including all taxes is 2, 555/- the difference amount is 855/- rupees, they are collecting Rs.50 to 200 per item according to its quantity!  Government should look into these type of cheating apps and companies to serve the right justice for the common citizens from these corporate thieves & robbers. So sad that we live in the society where there are many companies and apps cheating people publicly and the governments do nothing except leaving the people to their fate…"
"Swiggy services are getting better, delivery time has improved. keep it up guys. also the selection and updation of addresses in app experience got faster. I think they deserve 4 star now. I would have given 5 but I am still not over with my previous bad experiences."
Hey friends!!!  Here I am sharing my own and true experience. This is the worst application and waste of time and money.  I am facing the problem with swiggy application. They delivered me spoilt food. When I asked to replace or refund they refused straight away.  Worst customer care support. Atleast be responsible for genuine cases. How can you deliver stale and spoilt food and not take for it?  Playing with customer's health will result in downfall you see. It was mistake to the order from swiggy and I am uninstalling it right away.  Not ordering even again from swiggy application.  I strictly recommend do not use the swiggy application.
"Hi I live in delhi I have a very bad experiencewith swiggy. I ordered nonveg and I spend 520 rupees on it. first of all they take very long time to deliever. lemme tell you what hppn with me they delieverd is type in 50 minutes and food is also coolitsnot hot. one more thing its too spicy it is very bad with me I waste my money on this type of food, in future I dont wanna order from this swiggy appi used other app better than."
"Very protective about their restaurants.wanted to add a review about bad food quality and Swiggy says report to them and they will sort out internally with the restaurant! why?  delivery is not free and if you dont care about the quality of food delivery, well both swiggy and the restaurants are jointly responsible.  anyways, uninstalled the app"
Worst worst they r so unethical. I placed my order after one hour when I enquired y it's late.instead of feeling sorry they advised me to cancel very bad.I will never recommend any one time use it.most bakwaas app and their all commitment's are false
"This app is not that much impressive. We know that there are lots of apps like Amazone, Flipkart. but this one is different from all others Because they sell food for customers. We can select whatever food w like from whichever Resturant. But the worst thing is that food may cooldown while on the way. They should more careful about their service."
"Swiggy many times fraud with me. Very bad service by swiggy.com  Don't order from this swiggy.com In this fraud other many restaurant is also involved because they could call us and inform that this item is not available. I have pizza from top pizza, frirst of all I did not receives any conformation call or SMS form swiggy.com, after that look almost 2 hour to pizza delivers it. After a receive a pizza I have opened the box had one bite or food it was very bad teats. This pizza was very yuck, I had second bite it I felt like vomiting. It was cooked the dough was stale, cheese was also smelling very bad.  Delivery boy very bad behavior while delivery food."
"Hello people, I have read a lot of negative comments for Swiggy delivery guys, the way they ride, the way the discounts are not applied correctly and so on. I am a resident of Mumbai city. I have recently used Swiggy. Fortunately, I have not come across any issues with the food, the delivery or any app related issues. To my surprise, everything went well. I was able to apply promo code properly and get my discounts as well. As the food delivered was served hot and was delivered quickly. I also got one delivery done in heavy rains. I was so pleased to see the efforts these guys take. It more than a month now so I do not have any bill to show the discount I received. But I do really appreciate the kind of service these guys provide in Mumbai. I have heard from a lot of people when food needs to be ordered everyone has the swiggy app installed more than any other provider. So I am glad to know how much people love their service. I would rather appreciate if instead of giving bad reviews here, you call the customer service or drop in an email to swiggy support, they should surely try to improve their service in your area. They have generated a new way of giving employment. So do not criticize them, but help them improve.   Show Video"
This application just shows wrong rates of food online. They take more money than necessary for delivering it to the address. The delivery boys are impolite sometimes. They force us to give tips even though it is not compulsory.  Change in taste: The original taste that you can taste in the hotel has a lot of difference from the taste that the swiggy delivers. We cannot accept that because the main reason we buy food is for taste.  Does not work properly: I cancelled my order but the money was paid online and till now I have not received my money or they have not even replied to my complaints.  My view of point: Never buy online food here instead take away yourself. I hate this application and never pay using your debit or credit cards. They never give your money back.  Fake offers: The codes that they give as offers does not work at all. This is just an useless app do not use it.
"Worest customer service and high delivery charges, no manners for customer service executives my personal experience, there is responsible persons for service delivery boys also irresponsible no correct timing, no correct delivery no service no reply from executive"
"Today I. e22nd Oct 2018, we ordered food at 9.15pm. The restaurant is hardly 2kms away from my house.I didn't get any update even after half an hour.A guy named pandu was assigned for the delivery.I was standing outside end of my road and directing him the location and that fool is not able to understandat all.My daughter was hungry and still the guy was wasting time in arguing with me.finally I cancelled the order and slept without eating.So please don't order from this app.Especially if Pandu is assigned immediately cancel it."
Hey earlier I lived in city I frequently ordered food from swiggy... I was quite happy with this service.. but now I shifted to patancheru and I was shocked and sad to know that u won't provide any service in patancheru... please provide service even here...
"Swiggy's customer service has been giving me terrible experiences. I have been facing problems with them since long now. I don't know whether they don't understand the queries or is it that they pretend not to understand.  For example, I had ordered a large pizza and garlic bread from Pizza hut that had cheese dip included in the order. The delivery executive came down with a cold Pizza(with almost no vegetables on it. It was a vegetables exotic pizza) and garlic bread only. He didn't get the cheese dip and the beverages.  We immediately called up Swiggy customer care. A lady from the Bangalore office answered the call and said that she would get this fixed by replacing the orde. We gave away the ordered food back to the delivery executive. After waiting for about 1 hour 15 mins, we received the fresh order and it was exactly the same. Looked like they resent the same food. There was again no beverage and dip.  Previously when we had a word with the customer care executive, we asked them to talk to the delivery executive properly and to not to miss onto any item. When we called up Swiggy customer care once more and explained them the entire situation again, the executive(man) started talking in a high pitch and said that ""I won't be able to do anything, it is the restaurant's fault."" I told them that it might be the restaurant's fault but your executive promised to send us good food."" The executives don't keep up to their promises and I never expected a customer service executive to talk in such a tone."
"They started out good. I was quite happy to see that when I ordered something and wasn't satisfied at all, they initiated a refund immediately and without speaking to an agent. But here's where the buck stops.  An organization that ties up with other organizations(restaurants) is responsible for the food that is served by the restaurants. It is called supply chain management. They are making money off food purchased by us from these restaurants - they are equally - if not more - responsible for the food that we receive.  Received wrong order and burnt food today. They gave me an automated replacement. Got the same problem with the replacement order. Now they are not refunding my money. I DID NOT get what I ordered - twice - and now I have missed my lunch period at work and am going to go hungry till evening. I shouldn't just be refunded but compensated for my inconvenience as well.  They should not tie up with restaurants that sell substandard food like this one, or those that false advertise(many restaurants claim offers when the actual price you would pay at any other restaurant is just the same for the quality and quantity provided. Many restaurants also show pictures of their food and quantities/quality are nowhere close to what is shown.  To be hoodwinked by these restaurants is to be hoodwinked by swiggy. They are one and the same and Swiggy represents them.  Could not rightly recommend that anybody use this service. I, for my part, never will again."
SWIGGY cheats . Not owning up the refund for the order given and money deducted from there app. See the pic with there response . I never would recommend to order for any service if they can't own up the refund for the services they gave me there app.oney deducted from there app. Instead of apologies or some credits they disown .
"Neither got food nor refund  Placed an order on swiggy on 21/10/2018 and paid online for it. Being sunday thought i should order something online today... I was avoiding going out to eat with small kids...We faced so much inconveineice and had to cook specially for kids since order i received was pathetic...Customer officaild said I would get refund of 75 worth coupon whereas amt of order was 170+. Its been fifth time in a row i have been looted by their worthless food and service.. We are highly dissatisfied by the service.. would not recommend anyone to use it. Please look into matter. Instead of giving us compensation, our own amount has not been refunded. Really ridiculous ??"
Shocked and surprised to see how Swiggys is double dealing with people I ordered one and found that on one side they say after 15 percent discount it will cost 242 RS and on other side with no discount it will cost rs 225 how is it even possible they are fooling people
"Swiggy is one of the great app which let u order your food at your doorstep. It has a variety of items in it's bucket starting from eatables, snacks, to desert. Whatever you luv to eat just go on swiggy also the response team is active so that food i"
"Swiggy lets you order food from home through its mobile app or website and get the food delivered to your home there are many local restaurants available to order from. And swiggy also gives exciting offers for extra benefits and it accepts all major online payments so there is hassle free payment experience and no need to worry about change.not only local restaurants even major food chains like dominos , kfc, mc Donald's, subway etc are also available to order from.swiggy gives you express delivery even during rains they manage to deliver food in under 45min ."
"I had ordered a pizza . It was delivered on time bt it was the worst pizza I ever had...it was not even worth of rs 20 ... worst experience , highly disappointed with swiggy service....."
"As today dated 19-10-2018.I placed 2 orders from different restraunt and then the story starts when I placed order by my Debit MasterCard they accepted the money and after that When it comes to deliver food they  first of all don't have proper GPS system, Delivery boy not well spoken, Food was not hot.  When deliver boy called I told him the address they said we can't come in 2 min distance road and afterwards they said will make Ur talk to our boss and they didn't do it and afterwards they again called and afterwards the deliver boy talked to my father.My father talked with him in polite manner he said ""hum apkey Naukar nahi h Swiggy k h.Is this the correct way to talk??????.Then we went to pick order so he was arguing and drunk then he said all that stuff again my father just ignored this doesn't mean Ur delivery boy will say anything.Kuttey Phelaye Paisae laynaye k baad aisi service.  And then full food was not at all hot.What the use to order From Swiggy it's best to order from any other app than this.  If you had money first that doesn't you will not provide service proper.If I would had taken Complaint towards Consumer consumer than.  Swiggy better improve the service and First give Ur delivery boy training during job drunk and all nonsense"
#22154322999 dt Oct 9 at 3:28pm  #22154348239 dt Oct 9 3:46 pm  Above order are same. But to cheat they are put up in different ids  First id order was done by me on debit card which not finalized and promised to return money deducted within 4 days.  So I ordered again with COD which was finalized on cash basis. Meanwhile my bank confirmed that amount was deducted from my account. I chatted with 9 different persons on swiggy app but they say 48 hrs passed & it cannot be considered now. The shopkeeper who delivered has also confirmed two transactions happened. But swiggy is dumb on this issue.
"My friend ordered an item and waited for 1 hour outside our home only to get a notification that it is delivered, but not to us! The associate neither called my friend nor sent any notification.I had to call customer care three times and they were also unable to contact delivery partner.After around 1.15 hours I was able to contact him and he behaved in a disgusting manner asking me contact swiggy if I have any complaint. He was telling an outright lie that he waited for me for half an hour and was not able to contact us.He was not available on his phone any time during the order.The customer care executive was in a story telling mood explaining about logs and gps.In the end the order was cancelled and money is getting refunded.The customer care people were as bad as the delivery partner.Swiggy don' t care for your time or hunger. Find something else that does it.  Edit: Swiggy customer care executive called me and assured me that these situations will not happen again.Kudos for that."
"Has anybody ever seen the Swiggy riders in Bangalore?  If one thought that managing autos and two-wheelers was a challenge - think again.  If you are a driver or a rider and have managed to avoid a collision with a Swiggy delivery person then you are a pro or you have the luck of the devil.  If you have the crazy streaks or are known for driving on the wrong side of the roads, rash driving, breaking traffic signal lights, riding on footpaths, scratching someones car, etc then you are guaranteed of a job with Swiggy - incidentally, they are hiring as per their web-site. In fact I have been hit hard by a Swiggy rider - the guys flew off his bike when he hit my car. Just because others on the road knew that it was his fault, I was saved by my skin from being beaten up.  I think thats the criteria for recruitment because the management team sitting in the close confines of their office have no idea of the ground realities. I stand corrected, I think they choose or have been instructed to ignore it and turn a blind eye.  Now with the latest advertisement on a promised delivery within 30 minutes of placing the order has given the Swiggy delivery guys a new ""high"" and has institutionalised the rash driving. It's as if the founders and the management team is conveying to the delivery guys, that go ahead and do what you were doing cause you are good at everything wrong not now do it even more gusto since you now have our the open and explicit backing.  I seriously wonder how did the Economic Times award jury even decide on the criteria to bestow the Startup Awards 2017 - lookup Sriharsha Majety FB profile.  I seriously wonder on what basis do the investors invest in such startups? Don't the investing norms have a criteria for employee/contractor safety, adherence & compliance to rules, safety of the public at large? Or are the investors betting and more focused on getting a handsome return any which way they can? Doesn't matter if it means that the investee company is flouting all DECENT NORMS and rules of the country or city?  Isn't the company in its annual report by the directors and management have to report on the safety, environment, etc?  Haven't the directors or investors ever witnessed such crazy behaviour of their delivery staff?  How are these acts any different from the acts of goons and others who have swindled the country by breaking and flouting the rules?  We can all let our imagination run wild on how come these violations are ignored by the traffic cops right under their noses. You can see the sheer arrogance on the faces of the delivery guys.  Isn't it time for the directors and the investors to ask these questions?  Isn't it time for us as customers to boycott Swiggy unless they mend their ways? Why keep blaming the cops and the authorities for the sad state of affairs when you have companies who have been acclaimed on the front page of a reputed tabloid and who have deliberately and consciously flouted the rules just to deliver a great customer experience!  I would like to sign-off on with a small piece of advice especially on the dress code. The delivery guys(at least in Bangalore) are all dresses in black and with the poor lighting and the high-beam headlights, its just a matter of time for accidents to happen, if not already. Please change their dress colour AND OF COURSE THE ENTIRE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND ATTITUDE."
Worst and disgusting experience . I had ordered veg fried rice for a vegetarian guest in my office and it was yuck feel when you find a bone piece in your veg fried rice . I have the photos and video proof . The Beijing bites in BTM layout should be shut down immediately.
"Waited for 1 hour and didn't get the food. Ordered at 8:30, by 9 intimation about non availability of food of my choice, by 9:30 still food is being prepared. Very bad experience with swiggy with delivery boy and restaurant. Will not recommend it to an"

"Third class Service no response though customer care and delivery boy , I will never order anything on swiggy and I suggest to Don't order please please, bakwas h bilkul feedback bhi published no ho Raha it's shows third class service.bad very very very bad experience"
"It was my second order from swiggy, and both the time I got one missing order. Even they are not refunding the chargeable amount. Worst to place order from swiggy. Unprofessional delivery boys. On my first order delivery boy received cash payment that time I showed him that their is one missing order then after he charged me full about with excuse that he paid full bill amount to restaurant and he don't know about the items on my second order customer care executive called me for unable of item and I replace the flavour but after that they haven't delivered the item and again charged the full amount which I ordered"
Its the worst experienced on friday 12th october 2018.First of all it took one and half hour to deliver.That too cold food with stale bread and stale chicken(ordered burger) Even the service was as it took and one and half hour.Will never ever order from mini max mira road eazt.
I gave a order of Veg Thali on 10 October(Fauji Dhaba Resturant) through swiggy website. After two hours of order when I call to consern person( Nishant) that where is my order. He told me that we are not deliver that order and he use bad words when I ask for my order. I raise a complaint to swiggy for my order. They give me a complaint number regarding this and told me that it will resolve within 48 hours. When I chat after 48 hours swiggy told me that Your order time is more than 48 hours. We don't have any records. We can't help you.  This is big cheat with customer.  My order Number is #22227931986
I was really harassed last week ordering from Swiggy .. i used to pay my orders from amazon pay but that time amazon pay was disabled .. so I requested for pay on delivery & the order never came.. they called me at 11.30 just to tell me that my order has been cancelled...they don’t have fate even to their exiting customer...I spent that night without dinner... no more to say
"Swiggy customer service is good, but website confuses at the place of item image they are showing restaurant logo, my suggestion is to show item image in place of restaurant logo and restaurant name can be shown some other place. Swiggy has good customer service they follow back for complaint and resolved the issue."
"Very bad food delivery service. They never reach in time and usually bring cold food for me.  By the way the app is very easy to handle but due to their improper delivery of packages, it becomes in an i' ll mannered and an improper way.  I ordered a pizza ?? for dinner ?? but came about a half and hour late than expected time.  And also half of the pizza ?? was stuck to the lid of th box."
"You can find varieties of restaurants and dhabas on this app, so you have option to get taste of varieties of food. Since it covers dhabas, so you can get food at more affordable price. Delivery time is really very fast. App is very easy to operate, you just have to click on any restaurant and place order, it automatically search your location. Once order is finished you' ll find the exact position of delivery boy on it' s map with his phone number."
"Order no #22346334389, got call after 34 mins that order has been cancelled due to technical issue, wtf they were doing till 45 mins.  2nd order #22350497832 was expected to reach in 50 mins, the guy took almost 2 hours to deliver the food. super fast delivery i ever recived.! food almost left the oil n not in condition to eat.  Minus rating option must b there"
Hi everyone my name is manik jaswal and today I want to share my experience with swiggy a food delivering app to home.but their app is not established yet.during order too many ads and errors are occurring That I hate the most.therefore the website or app is not reliable and not user friendly too. Information that they provide for food and location is also sometimes wrongly spelled.the app contain too many bugs that they have to fix soonest. So at last I am not recommending this website or app to deliver food at home.and requesting the owner of this app to fix the bugs and errors as soon as possible.  THANK YOU !
I order from swiggy and the delivery boy was so rude and abusive on call (tu kya karlega nahi aata dene ) the most bad experience I have got and will never order from swiggy and will share same experience with people around me and guide them not to order from swiggy
I have been ordering in swiggy for a few days. And notice that the swiggy delivery is very fast. So thanks for the swiggy to write this review .If you order any day in the swiggy ( Except any occation day like puja ) .There is a delivery within half an hour.And a very good thing is available at low prices.The food is carefully from the shop.Swiggy boy are very frindly .Among other delivery boy. and swiggy app easy to use. Swiggy ' pop' is very easy to know.Any food that will be good.

"Great options. The idea of getting food delivered in 30-45 mins, which is much less than the actual cooking time of most main course dishes is just amazing. Swiggy also comes with amazing pricing options. There is variety & so many options. Swiggy has always served well. I order at least 4 times a month & have become a regular Swiggy customer."
"I have been using swiggy app for ordering my food since around 2 years. And from past 6 months I almost daily order my lunch from swiggy. It is the best because of its presentation of the menu of different restaurants. It has live tracking of the delivery agent.  And most importantly the customer support is fantastic. To support my statement I would like to narrate a small story which led me loving swiggy more.  I had ordered a 13"" pizza by paying ₹; 80 extra for the size. But the restaurant delivered me with 9"" pizza. So I immediately contacted the customer service through their app chat. After understanding the situation, the costumer service apologized for the inconvenience and then promised me to refund Rs. 80 and within 2 min the refund was initialised direct to my bank account through which I had done the payment.  From that day on wards I love swiggy more.  So I even subscribed to their super swiggy subscription which provides free delivery where ever you are if the order value is above ₹; 99. And surprising offers and all."
"Today I will tell you about the sweggy.com. You already read so money reviews about this website and you also noticed the bulk of reviews are same bacause every one wrote the same thing about swiggy but trust me I will not write same thing ??.  I use this website so money times in last 2 months and trust me guys if you use this website according to me then you will love swiggy. So guys if you already use swiggy then you already know that when you search for food the website show you somany restaurants some are near you and some are in littile bit distance, some are very cheap and some are very expensive. But guys the important thing which I thought everyone forget to notice is ratings and stars. Yes guys ratings are most impornat if you go with best rating I asure you your food will be great . According to my experience go with ratings friends ratings play a important role in online services.  So I hope after reading my review you will try swiggy atlist one time. But friends dont forget about the ratings go with the maximum rating restaurant' s."
"I have ordered food in some hotel and paid through paytm they debited money and sent msg stating that ur order payment was failed then called to the customer care there was a one useless guy he said that sir u should wait 24 hours to get refund other than that u don't have option to get refund it seems, I asked him to think I have only this much money in my hand that to u have detected and ur asking me to wait for the other 24 hours so till that what I will do that bugger has disconnected the call. It's waste of money. Please go for Zomato or food Panda."
I had order manchurian garlic noodles and the food was not fresh i felt. Manchurian balls were not soft to eat and it was tasteless. Top of that it took 90 minutes to deliver the food. So irritating. Delivery boy couldnt able to find the address even after several guidance. Why you guys do not suggest delivery boys to use google map?
"I have been using Swiggy for the past 6 months(I do not know why I was so patient for so long). I had issues with it since the very beginning:  1) Neither their Online Chat representatives nor their delivery executives are trained for the job properly.  2) If I have a serious issue I cannot reach them easily on phone as half their online numbers are wrong.  3) The quality of restaurants on their website choice is very poor, and a lot of the information there is not updated so we sometimes get the wrong item or just simply really bad food for a high price even)  4) Sometimes the food has been stale even.  5) If they make a mistake they do not acknowledge their mistake. Very poor customer service.  HERE IS WHERE I AM TOTALLY OFF SWIGGY NOW.  I ordered a meal today and the tracking system showed that the delivery executive was not picking the food from the restaurant but circling around it for sometime. So I waited and then called the guy. He said ""The restaurant is closed and he is waiting for it to open"". How silly is that. He should have called either his senior or me to tell me the case. On top of that Swiggy's excuse was ""'The restaurant did not update the website that it was closed""!  They don't even know what is happening with their restaurants and instead of taking responsibility for it they blame the restaurant.  Then I ordered again after wasting 2 hours of mine.  This time the food came with spillage. I had a guest over so I couldn't serve that to them. I had to end up throwing the food.  For reimbursement they said they would reimburse the 131 I paid online but not the coupon of 100 Rs that I had lying in my account. On top of that their customer service representatives even have the nerve to close the chat window when they could not resolve my issue.  SWIGGY IS THE WORST.  I GAVE 1 STAR BECAUSE THEIR IS NO CHOICE FOR 0 STAR.  THEY ARE PATHETIC.  Use at your own risk."
"Hello friends,  Today I am going to tell you about an awesome site to order food online and the name is swiggy.  restaurants connected with swiggy are good, food quality is great, they deliver before time. Behavior of riders is good.  My experience with swiggy is great. Everything was fine. Food was tasty. Delivery was around 16 to 19 minute earlier.  So personally I like swiggy. You guys can also try.  Thank you"
Food ordered at 8:40pm. It was prepared and picked up by the delivery agent. At around 10:41 pm received a call from him that his vehicle crashed. Called the helpline for support and without even having a clue that no food order is taken at 11:00pm at night he suggested to cancel the order. And after that all restaurants were closed and had to apologise to the guests
"Worst delivery, website interface, customer helplines and chat.when I ordered myu first booking there was discount coupon option tab available on the website.so I lost my first delivery 50% off option as promised.now after chat thorugh the app all I get are pathetic excuses which you dont get through zomato and uber eats.even the helpline voiceover is disgusting and not at all helpful.horrible experience"
"One of the my best online restorant shopping every time I get the delicious food.delivery is always awesome .every time I get my food dekivery on this witout geting late.delivery boys are better in bahaviour, most of the time I call to the owner of resto then prepared my dish before my making a irder on swiggy appliaction"
"I learn review about swiggy.com. Mostly are dislike its service some say that its service is very poor and not have a quality product then I suggest to swiggy.com owners that they need to improve their service. Some guys say that in their service have some technical problem to give service anyone this is not good for swiggy.com. another guy says that its service is too late about 45 minutes, it's not good. Another guy says that its employees have not manner and do not know how to talk to anyone."
Swiggy will give you VIRAL FEVER and NAUSEA . Don't Order from here .  Restraunt - Chak LE India bangalore specially munnekolala  they dont pick call and provide you yesterday food which will give you fever and yes they have provided dal in water.  worst quality and quantity and extra they are charging for what giving VIRAL to customers
Very reckless service. everytime some items are missing from the order. Delivery persons are very reckless and management don't care at all. If you are ordering in hungry don't choose swiggy. They will never give you food. If you ask for reason simply they throw your money back to you.worst experience.
"Delivery executives of swiggy are very rude and ill mannered, they have no idea on how to behave with the customers, had confrontations with delivery people many times, since I dont have time or energy to waste on these useless and mindless delivery executives, I stopped using Swiggy."
I ordered from MCD today and the order was confirmed at 1.40pm. technically the order delivered time is 33 minutes and till 2.20 pm the executive was not assigned to my ordered . tried contacting the helpline executive in chat and even after 4 minutes I did not get a response . this isn't the first time I had the the problem. once the delivery took 2 hours and another order arround 2 hours 30 minutes . thought the pick up resturant is within 5km
"I used to be a regular customer but recently they have dropped the delivery standards. Either the delivery guys are too dumb to understand the location or they simply do not deliver and yet set the status as ""delivered"".  Please use any other app. Do not install or order from Swiggy"
"Swiggy is a online application to order food for the stores. Hotel and restraunt in the city. It gives dilevers the food order in no time and does not charge any more money. Loved ordering the food in my offers. The price of the food item, which hotel you you want to order and the appropriate delivery time in mentioned in the app. The app is easy to download and install. It made such that it can be used by anybody. The app can be runned in less network speed. And requires no data charge."
"I have made a order at 9.25 pm, I got call from delivery executive at 9:50 pm that his bike got puncture and he will not be able to deliver so I tried reaching customer care by chat and phone, after trying for 20 mins I finally got connected. Customer care assured me my order will be assigned to different delivery executive and will be delivered in 20 mins, I waited for 30 mins so around 10:35 pm, I reached Customer executive by chat, he cancelled the order saying restaurant is taking too much time"
Its my first order. They offered discount and provided cheap food. Instead of faluda they delivered pathetic ice cream and the sandwiches are of so poor quality. not sure they got food from the restaurant I mentioned. There are no columns to place a feed back or complain too.
Hello friends Swiggy is just like other online food ordering app . But when u payment through online option be aware that if your order get failed and no history showing in your swiggy account then u have to face my problem. Just like me I recently on 23 sept order food and paid through paytm but my order get failed and no history showing it and my money has been deducted from my account . When I have contacted them they can't resolve my problem they are referring my previous order and they can't resolve my problem and their chat care service is also so slow they replied after long time and if u close your chat then they will marks u as resolved  So be aware when u pay through online make sure to pay through cash
"I have ordered 2 items at 08:20 pm today and its shows me within 40 min food will be delivered to me. After 35 min food was shown picked and after 5 min the clock stopped and delivery person was moving to wrong direction. I have called the person 15-20 times but he declined every time and not picked the phone. I called to customer care and they asked if delivery has been given?  What a silly question and then they requested that now the restaurant has been closed so they have to cancel my order. I asked for reorder but they said they can't.  Now at 09:50 pm where I go for dinner. If these person don't want to work simply they should not take the order but after this much time if they simply say sorry, it doesn't work.  Is this way they will work? Is there way to satisfy customers, nor they are reordered nor paying any penalty.  I will not use Swiggy next time and will request to my friends also to not use their facility."
"I have been using swiggy from a year now continuously but when it took time for me to realise that how bad service swiggy is been providing and how reckless the delivery guys and customer care executives are, I really hate and stopped using this swiggy"
"Yes, after reading my review you will agree with that heading. I placed a food order on Monday i.e 24th sep 2018 through swiggy food app from a restaurant which was literally 2km away from where I stay and I got a confirmation message from swiggy that restaurant accepted my order and delivery guy will be assigned soon but still after 1hour there is no update on order so I decided to chat with swiggy customer care where their call center is too busy so I literally waited for at least 30 minutes to get response from a guy name ""darshan"" with apologizing for delay and that's it he just disappeared without addressing my concerns and he again came back after 30 minutes and closed my ongoing chat abruptly so I decided to make a call where after waiting for 20 minutes.  I got connected to a customer service(cs) agent where he assured me that the restaurant is still open and there was technical problem on their side so my order is delayed and he assured delivery guy is on the way to restaurant and I will get my food within 10 min so I waited for 10 more minutes and there was no update so again I called to there cs and I waited for another 15min to connect to a cs agent and again she placed my call on for few more minutes to get update and she said that restaurant is no more serviceable and she was proceeding to cancel my order @ 12:07 am where they literally wasted 2:30hrs of time with false promises and nhassurances about food and after 12:00 am swiggy app gone offline that night and there is no restaurant that serves food during that time near my location but by god grace zomato is still taking orders where they promptly delivered the food otherwise I would have starved throughout the night. Next day I contacted them to get a response from their cs through chat and we cannot call the cs if you don't have an active order which is pathetic and chat service is one of the worst ever you see it will take at least 20-30 to connect to agent where they abruptly close the chat without addressing your concerns very irresponsible I don't have words to write more about them after this experience I uninstalled swiggy  ""please before placing orders after 9:00 pm on swiggy please be careful because they are not trustworthy to get food delivery on the night if they fail u will be starved ""  Swiggy we don't need apologies we need a proper customer service that can handle customer concerns and a timely delivery of food""  My order id: #20884062156  For proof, you can see a screenshot of the chat that I had with them"
"I dont even wanna give zero star. I order fruit salad from health n much . After 5/10 min they call to say that they didnt have some of the items I wanted, they told me they only have papaya, mango n apple for fruit salad. I opted for more items . So I told them to cancel the order . then after a min swiggy call n said they will charge me 75 rupees for cancellation. why shld I pay for if they do not have the items I wanted n cancelled it? Its not about 75 rupees I have to pay, its about wtf m I paying 75 for if they do not have the thing I order. Do not make sense at all. iam gonna uninstalled the app n never ordering from it again."
Hy guys I order on swiggy.com one saahee paneer and roti 2 days before and I got the order in 45 minut which is too late acoording to food website and when I got the food that was too cold which was not like to eat.i was so dispointed becouse I wait a lot to my order after that I throw that food and my next order done by food panda which is batter than swiggy they delivered my food
"It’s not the first time I have faced an issue, always the delivery executive behaviour was very rude and have no manners to talk. I have placed an order today I.e. on 27th Sept and total bill was INR 298. I have politely called the executive that I have 2 notes of 200 each and request you to kindly carry change of INR 100/- I called him in advance as he was standing at the restaurant and it’s bit easy for him to arrange change. But from his side he argued very badly and told me that I will not deliver it now. Do whatever you can. Not expected such low quality staff."
I placed an order today at 7.59 and due to rain it was delayed . It’s. Ten pm 2 hrs passed n rain stopped but they have no manners to call n inform regarding the status . Wil never order ever again such a bad management. Can’t rely on their service.
I would like to share my experience with swiggy.com  But after this experience I will never going to order food from swiggy.com because MS experience was so frustrating for me.  I have ordered butter masala dosa from seria butter masala dosa from swiggy.com and it showed me that it is to be delivered in 25 minutes.  And after 15 minutes the delivery boy called me and ask me to cancel my order or he is not going to deliver it to my home. I just called and cut the phone immediately so I called him back he didn't want to listen anything and when I insisted that I am very much hungry and can't make another 25 minutes for food to be delivered then he used abusive words and cut the phone.  Then I have no other option left so I have to order from another website this time and that's what was delivered after 20 minutes I was hungry for 1 hour after too much hard work in the office and it affects my daily schedule of other day.  From that time I swear that I will not order food from swiggy.com
"The swiggy service is the worst of its kind. They have become complacent. The agents do not even transfer calls to their supervisors and say they will arrange a call back within 24hrs. but no one calls.  The agents Sugandha and RaviKumar are just puppets reading a script, there is nothing they can help with.  I hope people do realise that Swiggy does not care for the customers, whether the food is delayed or items are missing. they should stop using it."
"Hello everyone, I have just ordered the food from swiggy last night and I'll share my experience with you.  It is actually a nice app with simple layout and design and at the same time also have a lot of features.  It will actually scans your location and then accordingly it will provide you the neighbouring restaurants and hotels from where you can order your stuff.  Obivously it's upon you to choose a better restaurant to order by going through the reviews firstly but I'll say that only good restaurants are listed in the app.  They also provides you a live tracking facility of the delivery boy, so overall the concept is good although other competitors are also there, but I'll suggest to use this app once."
"Swiggy claims to provide super fast and best food delivery. I had ordered chaat papdi and grilled patty from you, firstly you guys said that due to heavy rain it will consume extra time fr the delivery but still the food u have delivered was not hot and fresh. The patties were so crispy type that while taking bite it was getting cracked and spreading all over. The chat was also not good to the taste, there was no spoon with it. Very disappointed Pathetic service n careless. zero ratings from my side."
"In my case I have order a food which advance paid 180rs, and the order couldn't delivered to my location, saying that the guy tried several time to reach out to me on my call and waiting for long time for my response. that's why SWIGGY's going to charge my 75rs as penalty and refund 105rs saying that it was my fault that didn't respond to the delivery boy, but the reality was that I also tried multiple times to reach out him but his phone is always getting buzy.  I have a question that, if the SWIGGY want to save their customer's delivery address in their system at the time of login then why SWIGGY's delivery boy cancelled my parcel saying that He was waiting for my call response. IF they have value of their customer then they suppose to deliver that food package to my doorstep whatsoever I am responding them on their call or not not just saying that we were waiting for long time for customer reply and then we cancelled the order as per SWIGGY's convenience.  After all I would say that the SWIGGY company is not only the food delivery business but also it's having snatching money business from the customer's pocket."
"HI, I AM RAKESH . BASICALLY I AM NOT FROM TAMILNADU .BUT I ORDERD FOOD THROUGH SIGGY ONLINE. I TOLD TO ADRESS CLEARLY ALONG WITH DOOR NO .BEFORE I ORDER TO I CALL TO SWIGGY .THAT IS I HAVE NO CHANGE .PLS SEND TO CHANGE FOR DELIVERBOY.  BUT DELIVERY BOY, HIS NAME IS MURUGAN . HE IS CAME TOO LATE AFTER THAT HE USES RASHES WORDS ON ME .AND MANHANDLING ME .IPUT A CASE AT VADAPALANI POLICE STATION  SO, GUYS THIS IS VERY VERY CHEATED COMPANY .DONT TRUST THIS SWIGGY ORDERS .PLS.BE AVOIDED"
"Sharief Bhai is a new promising restaurant in Frazer Town. It's nowhere else but on Swiggy. Good job, Swiggy.  Well, the app is really great.  The app is very user-friendly and even the booking process is simple and convenient.  In terms of services, Swiggy is the best, it is the only app which has phone support. Even the chat support is very responsive and helpful.  As I mentioned before, it has best restaurants tied-up.  The delivery people are good and professional  and that applies to all those who have done the delivery to me till now.  Overall, the best food app with some best offers and real time tracking facilty. Hope they will continue to be the same."
"I have been using Swiggy for 2 years now and have had small issues which were handled quite smoothly. But today's encounter really left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and no respect for this company anymore. I followed the app's new promotion ""Unexpected guests! Use Swiggy to chose from restaurants around your area and we'll deliver hassle free"". I had unexpected guests show up for my birthday and placed an order with Swiggy for Baskin Robbins. The items selected were shown to be available and I payed through a card. After the order had been confirmed and the payment accepted I was called from the restaurant and told that none of the items I ordered were available. In order to help the restaurant offered other items which I had not selected because my guests have severe allergies. I spoke to 2 swiggy executives who only offered a refund on the order next week and said that I would have to reorder with another outlet and pay again. I did this and was again told the same thing - the items on my order were unavailable. This was just after a 20 minute call with a swiggy executive who assured me that my complaint would be forwarded to senior management and apologized on behalf of the team. My complaint is that your team is inefficient, does not tell the customer truth(when items are unavailable at the restaurant they are shown as available) and this incident has completely angered my guests who were visibly upset and have spoiled my surprise party. I have no interest whatsoever in using Swiggy or its services ever again and will close my account after I get my refund. I am a senior citizen and very disappointed at the way this incident was handled."
"I ordered food today at 11.20am. I got a call from the delivery executive at 12.05pm stating that my food wil be delivered after 2 hours as the restaurant just opened. For one hour my food ordered was not confirmed. Then I called the helpline number and discussed with them about the issue. Customer care agent was kind and understanding she managed to talk to the restaurant and change the delivery guy and delivered my order. Saurabh singh came with my food within promised time. As soon as my checked my order, I had placed an order fr bombil thali but unfortunately the bombil fry item was missing in it. I started checking other intems and it’s strange that even bombil curry didn’t even had a single piece of bombil in it. I called the customer care executive. Her name is Shilpa. I explained her all the mess that happened. She went back and checked with the restaurant and she got to know that the restaurant didn’t had the particular item not available and hence they didn’t send it. How can they fool the customers like that. We spend money on all the orders we place and if guys are going to fool us like this then I don’t think you will be having a a loyal customers like me in future. Being a reputed company like Swiggy you guys need to do audit check on the restaurant if they are giving actual good food delivery, is the food quality good, are the customers happy. If this thing will keep on happening continuously then a company like this will not sustain for more time. I hope my email will help u in getting all the regular checks done.  I appreciate Shilpa’s effort in getting things fixed for me. She is truly a gem for the company."
"I ordered cake via coffee day, first problem I was told the order was accepted and getting prepared, nearly after 30 mins of time I got info that the mentioned cake is not available, above all the executive who spoke with me for cancellation of the order is not able to provide me any options rather was very harsh in the way he spoke. He didn’t even listen to my concern or provide a solution rather focused only on cancelling the order. It was really a worst service I would say. This is not the first time am encountering such issue. Hate you swiggy for this type of attitude shown to a loyal customer. Above all there is no proper option to put feedback into the app."
Items were missing from my order. Full payment was made. Also Customer support service did not accept calls and chat service is too slow. Very bad experience. Zomato is far better than swiggy. As they are working it will not last long. I am really disappointed.
I had placed an order from renowned restaurant Savali from Nigadi area on 19th Sept .Food delivered in a manner that I had to throw that food.It was totally loss of money. The issue was highlighted at the same moment on Swiggy’s customer team but there response was they can't do anything for this.I will recommend not to purchase food from such kind of apps which are careless about customers and this is related to your health.
"I am very disappointed with the mastani shake we had today.  My Order No. # 20346665215, The issue was highlighted at the same moment on Swiggy's App but they said will not take any action.  Please provide good support and do not break your customer trust."
THIS TIME I WAS DISAPOINTED WITH SWIGGY SERVICES .THE burger and fries of burger king were totally cold and tasteless. we ordered large sized coke but we received the small one. IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. WILL GIVE A SECOND THOUGHT WHILE ORDERING FROM SWIGGY .I NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE WHILE ORDERING FROM BURGER KING
"Hello everyone. I am mangesh, am leaving in pune. In tv add we watch a swiggy advertisement that one man order a gulabjamun and they got in at home delivery. First of all am not beleaveing it that , how its possible for only one bite of gulabjamun how any one delivered a product. For checking that its real or not I am ordering a paneer masala product in near hotel called 'hotel mrunal' . For my first order swiggy give me a offer which is very nice. That is 50% discount on any food. And I am so happy. We got this delivery in 75₹ only. After that we buying other 3 delivery one by one. Their customer service was very nice and kindfull. One day I have no change to give exact amount of delivery. Then a delivery boy give me back my money in phone pay apps. Thàt was so nice that to see how our india going to digital india. I am feeling proud."
Guys see the difference in direct purchase and order through swiggy. 74 rupees more I am paying when order through swiggy.It would be better swigy explains their way of charging. I am sure they will loose business if this continues. Better check couple of times the prices before ordering.
"Swiggy is bunch of idiots.  The morons developed the website. The dumb idiots are delivery executives and customer care people are dumb and illiterate. I wish here was negative ratings as well. The MF owners of swiggy, do you read these abuses.  Please buy a big lock for this company and spare people."
This app which is now a days famous but after ordering an item the order will be placed but it takes much more time than they given below not only that the food or item which we had ordered is not good I mean that the item will be not so good taste they should improve more and more because of they improve only they will get good and more orders for them and must and should improve the food quality because if the item quality is good the person will wait for few more minutes also so better to improve food quality you must and should do it that sol I want say
Hii. swiggy I am just trying to do the job in swiggy in vijayawada I had expirince in hyderabad also but m not give my resign letter so plzz help me to find he slolvwe issue and rejoin in vijayawada thank youand plz giveme any contact number in vijayawada
"I am very disappointed with swiggy today. my food took 1 hr 30mins to be delivered. called the delivery guy deepak das. he said his bike has problem. if thrs a problem whywasnt I informed? after that only he canceled the order for someone else to pickup. 3 times was the pickup canceled. later the guy who came in for delivery couldnt find the location despite gps. has to walk down at 12.40at midnight around 300mts from my house to get the food. over to that food got cold. when asked why so. the delivery guy told its night n no one wants to come for delivery this part.  if thats the matter, dear swiggy stop taking orders from this location.but when u do please make up to ur service. really embaressed in front of my guests. had given feedback too. please do followup if u think ur customer are important. or is it u have grown too big to consider one single customer feedback."
Yesterday I ordered an item from Swiggy Pop for the 1st time and expecting it as amazing as the normal swiggy delivered but my experience was hampered and hopes were shattered.  The food was extra salty and distasteful. When I asked your customer support they said that food quality and quantity is not your headache but of restaurants. Then why are you featuring it in Swiggy Pop.  If you cannot ensure the quality of food then open a listing platform and not a delivery platform.  Disappointed! I was your regular customer and you can see that in my history but the way you have been handling your service is deteriorating day by day.
"Bad quality food, No Restaurant partners contact no's, Long waiting to talk to swiggy call centre, keep you waiting on chats as well. Worst than Zomato.  I complaint half of the times I ordered from Swiggy.  Today I ordered Pasta Arrabbiata, it was like Dhaba style."
"Never had such experience in Swiggy like this.  Grill house's response was an unexpected one.  They did say that they make same biriyani and just add pieces accordingly for chicken and mutton, How does one restaurant do this? This is an Ultimate cheating. There must be a serious action to be taken on this. And when I called they randomly told me to come and check directly in the restaurant. The food wasn't a biriyani at all, it's rotten and got an awkard smell too. Either I need my money back or any other action to be taken or else I am gonna file a case."
"They delivered wrong order. They don't care about the customer.  I got 8 chapati(including 4 misi rotis, 1 nans, and 3 butter roti), and only one plate of shahi paneer.  How can 3 people eat that much of chapati with only one vegetable.  Order was 5 chapati with 2 dal makhni.  They don't think about customer.  And customer care is also justifying, that they did not have dal so sent same cost value of paneer."
I ordered food and waited forever. Still no response delivery boy and his phone was switched off when called. Customer care also sucks. if I had option to give negative rating I shouldve given that to these bloody buggers. I hate this portal. WIll never use again
My order no #19662936986 . I placed simply veg pizza extra burst. While placing order for the first time I applied coupon BINGE50 and it show 124 RS . Total bill amount was 224 but after 50% discount upto RS 100 the value shld be 124. When I connected with my Paytm wallet RS 224 has been deducted . While on chat they said it's my mistake tht u havnt applied the coupon and they r refund the money.  Moreover when I received the order the base of pizza is raw. Not at all properly baked. And swiggy said it's Pasta la Vista mistak u complaint to them . While pasta la Vista said it's swiggy mistak u ask for refund but non of them did anything.  V v poor service and responses
"See I placed an order from Phul kha, Faridabad and it was really disappointing.  firstly chinese order needs to be served with good sauces and I didn't receive it  Secondly, paneer was hard and had a weird non veg taste  Thirdly, vegetables in the noodles were not fresh  However, when I asked for the refund, Swiggy refused to give . this is a sheer waste of money .if the customers don’t get what they ask for, the company has to take the responsibility and bear the loss but with Swiggy, it’s the customers who become the scapegoats"
Worst than any other food delivery app. One that their delivery boy doesn't turn up in time and most often wrong food gets delivered. At time delivery of stale food and when you ask for refund then they have coupon fixed amount as a token to refund irrespective of your order value.  Pathetic experience so far.
"Swiggy is going below expectations. Poor partners providing cheap quality foods, even customer cares are not helpfull nowadays. Hope swiggy will go with bettere partners and options to make the customers worthy. Please remove desi vibes from swiggy. Very bad quality of food and the way of treating customers as beggers"
First I saw this site and I am impressed but after ordering something to eat we have know that the this is a bad site for ordering food. I order some maggi and Burger but it take almost one hour to delivered to my home. So I requested to the site that please make it faster.
"My first time order Experience, was ""pathetic"" . Points to Swiggy  1) Twice I was informed that my order is on its way(After 45 Mins of ordering) . but the third time I inquired where is my order(almost 1:30 Hours). I was still in the Kitchen? - Swiggy please come up with realistic and believable track systems.  2) Delivery Guy told me he met with an accident - but he sounded much normal and lazy to deliver ones order(No offence to anyone's personal issue)  3) The chat executive told me if she should cancel my order -why the hell we should I order and on top of it pre pay for a Over delayed service.  4)  if order takes 2 hours to deliver, we might as well cook ourselves . WHY SWIGGY?  5) The chat executive told that after order is delivered I should contact Swiggy so that compensation is given - Really SWIGGY? Its like we cannot deliver on time but Compensation might be helpful for a Hungry Stomach - STOP compensating customers and work towards betterment . It not about getting a free meal its about service you give so one can come back and have a good feedback .  still no clue of my order after almost 2 hours 30 mins ."
"On multiple occasions, my orders were either wrong, or the quality was super bad. Calling customer service doesn't really help, because the immediate representatives have absolutely no authority. They are unable to resolve problems, issue refund. I asked to talk to their supervisors, and I was told to wait for 10, and I will receive a call back, which OBVIOUSLY I didn't. So I called again in like 30 mins, had to explain the damn situation again to their immediate representative, who cant do S*T. This lady places my call on hold, and after 2 minutes, hangs it up!  No wonder Swiggy's customer service is pathetic and everyone knows about it.  Improve and listen to your customers, else keep taking hits and burn to the ground."
"I like swiggy.com online food service, because they delever fast and hot.Actually swiggy work faster then other in hyderabad so you can use swiggy.com for your food service. The delevery boys of ( swiggy.com) are so friendly I think they carefully delrver our order to us on time and make us happy. I really happy."
Swiggy claims to provide superfast delivery but for this sake . the delivery boys don't follow basic traffic rules(self experience of an accident with a swiggy delivery boy).He came in from the wrong d  side and had no manners of taking.didn't even say sorry when it was his fault entirely. my friend's activa got more dents than his scooter and even the expenses are high now. The claim of superfast delivery are of no use if the delivery boys are to create a havoc in normal traffic.
"When you are hungry as well as tired and you want to eat good food from a nearby restaurant, Swiggy is there to help you.I have been ordering food from swiggy from last 2-3 years and it never disppoints me.I consider is as the most trustworthy and better than it's competitors.Most of the times, it has delivered before delivery time excpet some unavoidable circumstances.  I am highly satisfied by this app and it's services.And by fault if something wrong has been delivered to you, then they either replace it or refund the money."
"Hi  This is my worst experience with any online merchandise. I ordered food on 31st Aug 2018.    Swiggy Application is unreliable which usually take wrong address and no option to enter manually.    Swiggy cancelled order themself and putting penalty charges on customers . They don't bothered about customer and not willing to check about the concern.    Same time their delivery boy visit at delivery point and asking that your order has been canceled and I can deliver the order if the payment can be given in cash . asked payment amount is more than the amount already paid for online order. - Excellent    There customer care executive are sitting there to give one reply only that we can't do anything then why swiggy had giving such help option and deputed such customer care executive .      Finally Swiggy is made for worst services, cheating to customer, creating inconvenience to customer and wasting time.  I need my full amount of refund along with 100% penalty by Twiggy."
"Delivery time more than 2 hrs and didnt got any cashback.when called customer care they told it will take 24hrs, when calling back after 24 hrs they saying that there is no offer for 100% cashback.  it was my first and last order.Please dont order from swiggy."
"Help line for wrong order is unhelpful and try and justify error of restaurant and implore you to be idiots .  Besides person by the supposedname sayyed on help line refused to give employee id citing personal info! Do these guys take us for uneducated and unaware ppl?  Best to avoid Swiggy for ordering food, there standards have hit rock bottom and seem inclined to remain there."
"Your customer representative accepts an order and then speaks rudely saying he can't deliver and please call customer care. The customer care representative Soumya Saha says that I have to cancel the order since he was far away. I ask for the Manager and he doesn't come online, refuses to talk to me saying he's on other calls and I am left with no other choice but to cancel and reorder at 11 o clock. There is nothing done from swiggy side to assist a customer in need and stop wasting time by explaining and delivering the order asap. Very bad and very unprofessional service without any concern for the customer. Now I have to wait for a soup that is late and cannot be eaten. I had told the representative that I will be putting up a review for this to avoid other people from further harassment and starvation at the expense of swiggy. Horrible."
"It don’t know about anybody else but fr me its a fantastic app to order anytime my toung delighting food to my door steps .as am foody it helps my tummy to get satisfied, when its need.seeing me eating my favourite meals at night.my room mates gets jealous nd they tried it a lot .only bcoz of me"
"Hello guys today l am sharing my bad experience with well known food delivery app -Swiggy.com  I recently ordered sweets on this app for my sister to her house on raksha-bandhan. I thought that they delivered their sweets quickly on raksha-bandhan and gave her a surprise from myself.from Swiggy  But they did completely opposite to that , they delivered order at evening which is completely opposite to their promise which is Deliver food in time.  Then l realised Swiggy is only made for making us FAKE and FOOL.It is worst app for online Food delivery and that, s too available in big cities only.and that, s also too slow.  It is completely opposite to it, s marketing. It, s service and support are not good. It is not user friendly app."
Puts a Heavy Cancellation Fee on Cancelling the order while other brands do not do such things .They will take fine from your next future orders and needless u have to pay.i Cancelled it because my roommate bought food from outside without taking my consent This is insane and also it does not have a good customer support never go for it!
The rediculous services provided by the swiggy. Initially your service was good .I was the regular customer who used to order daily twice or thrice through swiggy .but from 7 days the issues am facing by swiggy is horrible .in last 7 days 3 to 4 times some items were missing in the food .after reaching your customer support they had given ₹75 coupon.what to do with that coupon on that you guys charge delivery fee extra .one or two times customer care didn't even replied to my call& chat .I have all the conversation& recording of this . your delivery boys gets late many a times .they deliver one other order& they come here after 1 and half hour .before writing this also I had ordered from swiggy& my food was not delivered after one& half hour also .I called your customer care they didn't respond .then I called your delivery boy he said that he is delivering another order it will take more half an hour to deliver that order& from there it will take again 15 to 20 min to reach me .what a rediculous& rude behaviour he was having . the order which I had given at 9 pm it will take more than 2 hours to reach .we will be hungry till this time .do you have some care about your customer or not.they are just fooling us now .
"I had order food at 8 pm and delivered at 9.50pm. Waste of money and no response from customer care. Kids were waiting very long time and slept without dinner. Entire night is horrible.  Time taking, No response, no care. Waste of time and money, I couldve ordered directly.  Please do not order such a service.  Legal team mobile is blocked."
I have ordered Pizza online at 3 am in morning on their website they took the order also as per their process The delivery time of pizza was 42 minutes but it was not delivered then I call to customer care for more then 4 times they said the delivery boy has taken your order and he will be there within 2 minute  After that their gps services could not find my address in delhi ncr? That guy reached to some another place and he asked me to share your address again I shared my address but he said its 27km and I can not come to that place  I just want to how would you take care of this thing and my question is with the seniors person who look after this company and process not with that delivery boy I have more worst words to say about your advertisement which we use to over TV ads and what so ever the social media you use! If you can not handle the things they why promotion do much just to attract customers and then after let them wait and let them be hungry after ordering The food  Bhaiya kuch to kro kuch to kro ya bus promotion krke hi dikhaoge
"Hi,  Today we have given order for 2 Veg Biryani for kids, The Biryani is worst and No Vegetables, Only Rice that is also full of Oil and which was cooked in the afternoon, Raitha is also worst. Biryani is too much roasted, I think this was remaining one after selling the item.  This is getting very unhappy during the dinner today.  Please provide quality of food else stop providing the service.  Very very bad experience for us today, I have also attached the photo of the Biryani"
Order was placed yestersay to Deepak Patwa. The guy whu came to deliver had no swiggy tshirt . was difficult to undastnd. secondly the order was late .no decency of calling n updating da customer n no apologies for his end.(disgusting service) Thirdly I was waiting to rate this guy but no rating form came up even after the order was delievered .please look into this n let Deepak Patwa know we customers arent fool we can still give rating by going to the website .This feedback will be posted everywhere. Thanks!
"It seems swiggy is not a reliable source to order food as today I faced very bad experience.  My family ordered lunch from siwggy today and it was type of insult for me when I see 6 roits are missing in the order.  Worst part is I tired to reach out to call center through chat and via phone call, no one responded.  I strongly recommend not to use swiggy to order food."
I ordered dood on swiggy around 11 pm. After 20 mins Delievery boy told me that restaurant is closed. At that time most of the restaurants got closed. I could have ordered somewhere else if swiggy didnt accepted my order.  After that I got calls from swiggy and they asked me to cancel the order. But I denied to do so. After few minutes I got message that my order has been cancelled without my permission.
Ordered veg received non veg n worst part is restaurant is pure non veg. Have raised concern with swiggy but received response as they won't repeat again n till today restaurant in swiggy shows veg . Pathetic service n careless response.Sambit from higher management agree for action but no action taken till today . Not even they returned money also .
Tonight I ordered three items through Swiggy pops in Kolkata.they cancelled two orders from their end without even contacting the customers.they refunded the money but what happens to people who wait for their food? Such a callous and impolite attitude!  For the third order they sent different food than what was ordered for! Shame on them.they are keen to take orders but do not have the ability to handle!
I had d worst service from swiggy and they did nothing apart from apologizing. Firstly they asked me to change my order then asked me to cancel d order. I cancelled and replaced with another restaurant. I got d order way too late. Cold and stale. Very unhappy
This very bad . I order pizza and pizza coming two hours and pizza guy attitude very bad this is again second time place order late order customer service is very bad my friends tell this App waste of time and money I tell all love you please don't download this app and website and this app and website I place order all food very high cost totally waste of money my friend join job for swiggy but he dropped this job only 2 days because this is boring all people disappoint this app thank you and please don't try this app or website
Very bad customer service.they are just making customer fool.other delivery app are very good as compare to this.they are something delivery other order to you.management are bad they are just making fool of customer . delivery guy attitude is very bad
This website allows us to order food online from your favourite nearby restaurants  Swiigy delivers food to our address within minutes .We can track the delivery online via Google Maps on your smartphone.Its that simple. Swiigy also provides coupon codes so that you can enjoy your food at a lower price.Swiggy also provides apps that is user friendly.
The entire layer of topping was badly damaged. it seems like pizza must have been felt on the road from the delivery boy and he would have recollected the pizza and packed in the pizza box in a really messy condition. also the tissue paper were used. I want to add that there were 2 delivery boys on the bike. and I think there should be only one delivery boy.
This is my third review against swiggy but it’s not that only three times I am disappointed it should be 10 in count.  Swiggy will shut off very soon if this kind of service they will give its already an hour over and at last they called and told due to some technical issue it will take more 40 mins to get delivered.  One of the worst service they took 1000 delivery orders at a time to deliver.  One of the very worst online delivery site for food.
"When I played my order, the discount coupon was working and rates were half but at the time of delivery I was asked to play the full amount . When I persuaded for cancellation the person on behalf of swiggy replied that I would be charged for this in my next order, persuading me to buy on full rates"
These people are giving veg tags for non veg items.  please check screenshot attached.  Read name of dish and the description of it.  Veg dish contains chicken!  These people are giving veg tags for non veg items.  please check screenshot attached.  Read name of dish and the description of it.  Veg dish contains chicken!
"I have ordered ice cream from Cream stone through Swiggy yesterday and after 20min or so received a call from the delivery person that he is unable to locate my address and the GPS is pointing out to a different location.  I was ready to help him with the address in case the GPS is not tracking the location correctly, but then that guy was very in different to follow my instructions and bluntly said that he can only deliver at the place where the GPS points to.  While I was explaining the address, he was so arrogant and hung up the phone abruptly saying that the order will be cancelled.  I was clueless why the order is going to be cancelled, if I am ready to help him out with the address which is quite close to the place where he was waiting.  After 5 -10 min, I got a call from support team saying that they are going to resolve the issue. I was not sure whether they have cancelled the order or planning to deliver. After waiting for sometime without any intimation I tracked the status in the app and saw the delivery guy near the parlor.  Again they called me after sometime requesting for details on the issues and before I clarified they disconnected the phone.  I find these guys do not care for the customers and act according to their whims and fancies. What pissed off me the most is a message saying the order was cancelled since I was not responding.  Blaming the customer for no reason and indifferent attitude of the customer support and delivery guys.  I presume GPS is only an enabling tool for tracking locations of the client and not the only source to rely on when the customers are reachable and ready to help. It did not make any sense when the delivery guy said that he can deliver the food only where the GPS directs, I think people are more dependable and we make the best judgement.  Moreover their apps are not so upgraded to update the address details manually in case the GPS has some hiccups.  This way I do not prefer to reorder from Swiggy, they are many other delivery apps which provide far good and timely service.  Thanks,  Vandana"
"No respect for customers time. Extremely insensitive to the fact that they are delivering food and people may be dependent on them for a meal or a party.  I ordered food and paid and the app kept showing the food is picked up for delivery. After an hour, they sent a message that they are cancelling my order. It was already 11:30pm and all restaurants were shut by then! This was the last time I ever ordered through Swiggy."
This is the worst service ever they provide even if address is given and location pick would not be exact and even if if we call up the delivery executive and tell them the address wantedly they don’t come and lot of arrorgance for the executives. They collect delivery charges but still don’t deliver on time. Worst service ever.
"We happen to order paratha & chole batura. We got dosas instead. The worst part is that they are not ready to refund, says we have changed our policy and expected us to eat what has been provided to us. Never ever experienced this ever. When checked with the customer service, says sorry we cant do anything about it. We also see clearly the option of refund in the Swiggy App. This happens to be my first review in Mouthshut, this whole experience was so bitter that I couldn't help sharing. At that point of time, we were dead hungry and couldn't wait to eat, unfortunately we had to pay for what we don't eat - this is the worst thing a customer can experience ""pay for shit"". Above all the dosas were cold and we had to throw them! Hell of an experience that was. Please never ever go for Swiggy! never!"
The payment gets deducted but order not placed. Customer care is shitty. They don't even reply. Check the image I've uploaded.also I tried calling dem but they dint allow to tt the executive saying that there is no current order on ur account just go to Help in the app
"This will never update availability of food items at restaurants. Almost wait time of 1 hour, they call back saying item not available. Its continuous experience from different restaurants. Better not to order from this to save time. And above that the cancelled orders take away coupons/offers and cant use back."
"I order paneer, mix veg, 3 naan. my bill is 575. quatity level is very bad. After I spoke with someone agent. they told we share your feedback. I have small party in my family. I feel ver bad. I publish everywhere and suggest everyone never order from swiggy."
"I am residing in an apartment in Chennai. Today morning at around 8 am, I noticed a swiggy delivery person came to third floor for delivering a stuff. He came and kept lift door open till he returned back to the lift. When requested, he did not behave properly. The way in which that guy had behaved revealed low standards of people coming for delivering. Please be careful with these guys. It poses threat to our safety."
I have ordered 3 items from swiggy and they had delivered all three items wrongly . This mismatch was happening third time with Swiggy. I really asks theses guys to have some commitment to the job they do . The items were placed in glass box and it was easy for delivery person to cross check it . The customer service people didnt even gave a proper apology. I have taken from Uber eats also multiple times there was no problems so far
First of all why the hell your sending messages daily stating that we need delivery boys for 25k. You want to promote that more people should fall for high cholesterol level .we just ordered one time food after that daily this message is coming.This is another form of socially taking people to food addiction or ask your tele people not to send bulk mailing.
"So ordered a veg pasta& got keema pao instead from SWIGGY. So called them up& told them I want a refund for my amount and i’m very angry about the matter. All they can say after a 10 min long hold is, mam we can only take a feedback abt the issue and nothing else. Now after an hour of ordering food I am minus Rs 308& food."
Hey guyz.please ensure before taking ur parcels. Today I had a worst day with swiggy.  I had order 2 parcels from one of the resto through swiggy app. First off all it came Late almost he took 1hr 10 mints to deliver. Then I got only parcel instead 2. Then I complained the same to swiggy customer care.and told then I recieved only 1 parcel so I will pay for 1 remaining refund me. Then literally refused to refund my amount instead they said we will process 50 rs coupons for your incovinien we I charged 380rs for un deliverd parcel.i tried to make her understand but no use.So moral: I didnt get anythng nor my 380rs which I paid for un delivered parcel nor 50 rs coupon.so this is the worst experience I faced today.and decided not use this worst app in future.
"The food delivery service is pathetic. they mishandle the food upto an extent that it cannot be served to anyone.  addiitonaly their customer care support is even worse. whenever you try to raise a concern, they either offer you a small cashback or deny any support. You many end up wasting your money and time. Its better not to rely upon swiggy and prder food directly from the restaurant."
"All lie worst service ever received .and second instance.order was placed for fried rice n chilly chicken . Food received was burnt and complaint Swiggy guy offered replacement from same place to get same quality of food  I had been ordering through food panda, zomato never had this bad experienc.swiggy is cheap just nexus quality and service they offer is poor  All they can do is give fake robotic answers"
Ordered food from Burger King for RS.750. Got food worth 450 only and the customer support guy says he can give me a coupon worth 100. He says the amount is system generated. This is not the first time. Last time the delivery person could not locate the address. After guiding him for an hour I had to give up and cancel the order. These people should have some integrity atleat
"I order dinner which included a starter and Main course. I was surprised to see entirely burnt starter and Stale main course. I informed Swiggy services using chat option which was closed sighting reason that I was not available for response. Then I called Swiggy and executive told me that the issue will be resolved in 24 hours after proper assessment by Restaurant representative. I asked the method of assessment as food smelling bad can not be captured anyhow. Though I shared photographs of burnt starter, executive could not reply for this query satisfactory. I told executive that this stale food had spoiled an event but nothing was done at his end. Executive told me to write to support team for faster response on. I did write to support team and received a mail claiming that the issue would be answered within 12 to 24 hours. I didn't receive any resolution though within that to frame. I called Swiggy to my surprise my call was not transfer to any executive cause I didn't have any active order. I was instructed to go to help section. I did visit there and chat was started. The executive offered me a coupon of 25 rupees in return. When I told him that actually had to throw the entire parcel. He agreed to generate replacement order for starter though main course part was not entertaint. This response was surprised to me."
I will not recommend swiggy to order food.I have ordered food today and not yet received the food.I have even paid the money also and they is no one here to respond on this.It's 3 hours am waiting for food.  dnt order in swiggy  I will not recommend swiggy to order food.I have ordered food today and not yet received the food.I have even paid the money also and they is no one here to respond on this.It's 3 hours am waiting for food.
Ordered at 2:14 and it's 3;30 still my order is nt confirmed came from night shift and used this app for the first time this is what I get waste of my time. The swiggy guys gets the order but the restaurant doesn't. And to buy food from near my restaurant and was surprised he delivered it so quick when I called offline what a useless app and service from them called twice and I was told what can i
"I had terrible experience multiple times , either order got delayed or cancelled. Sometimes they made me to wait for 1 hour and in the last minute they cancelled saying your location is not serviceable.Imagine if it happened at 10.30PM in the night and where else you go to have food. Never trust this app and the way they operate. This is not reliable service and never pay them before if you still want to order from here. Today 310PM on 7/30/2018 I placed an order at 1:50PM and now the time is 3:05PM. I just got a message saying your order got cancelled due to technical difficulties. I decided I don't want to order from this app here after."
"I ordered for Kashmir ka pulao, but they have delivered local south india pulao wwhich is nothing but rice with mixed vegetable. It's clear that they show different menu and deliver different item. also no bill from which restaurant they brought the item"
I have faced issues whenever I have placed order. Either the delivery person cancels it uninformed or they dont deliver it to the right person.no acknowledgment. Even the Cx service representative Teams are not supportive. Even if we ask for a Manager they would decline.Swiggy is just a wait of time and I have unistalled the app. They dont deliver what they promise.quiet upsetting
"Hy Friend, Today I will tell my personal Experience in Swiggy, last two days back I Have Ordered Some Pizza in Swiggy, They has Been Delivered With in 30 Minutes. Its Very Amazing the fast Delivery, I Appreciate that Delivery Person, food packing also Good & Fresh, Swiggy Most of the family using this app and More than people Recommended This app. food rate Also Normal And Some Discount also Given Swiggy"
"Food was delivered very late, when called up the pickup guy about an hour, he asked me where to come. I asked him was he waiting for my call to know where he should come?  You can just start a service and maintain it just like that. Investing more energy in managing reviews is better than showing stupid ads on TV"
Worst customer service ever. Today I ordered Biryani and found hair in that. Order ID is 15240371887. Asked customer service to resolve the issue by uploading image. But they said they will generate a coupon. I said I don't want to use coupons. I paid Rs.224 through Paytm and asked to refund the money. They are bargaining with me by offering coupon. The worst customer support ever. Customer service executive Arpan and Deepthi Adikari argued to generate coupon. Is this acceptable? I paid for Biryani and they surprised me by providing hair in Biryani ? I am not gonna order anything from Swiggy. Keep my money and enjoy ?
"Hi friend, last month I have ordered some foods in swiggy, they has been delivered with in 45 minutes. I appreciate that delivery guys, they reached quickly. Foods also very hot and tasty. I personally order food from outside a lot so this swiggy app is very different it will give you offers all around the year, actually most of the food delivering companies will only give you offer for a month or two then once they attract the customers they will stop giving you offers but in swiggy you will find offers the whole year yes and atleast 30% discount will be there. swiggy most of the person using this app and more than people approaching this app. So I feel that its a very good platform I personally like that this app.middle class people also using this app.foods rates also good for all peoples, so only I said good for this app."
"Swiggy the most famous and awesome app on google play store.  Basically it is a food odering app it delivers you food from various restaurant near or away from your home.  I am using swiggy from past one year and my experience with swiggy is awesome, they deliver the food within 30-40 minutes after ordering.  Swiggy also gives 50% off on your first order and later on some cash back when you pay from debit/credit cards and net banking, they also have cash on delivery option.  They only charge ₹30 for delivery and sometimes delivery is free.  Excellent experience with swiggy."
Hi guys this is somashekar going tell about of this online store I am very disappointed with swiggy because of its delay in food delivery and the quality of food actually one day I went to eat non-veg so order in swiggy chicken drumsticks and Tangerine kebab I was waiting for food but they getting very late after sometime they called me and say in the delivery boy watch standing in front of my apartment and he was saying that to collect my order a down of my apartment its reduce and I refused to do so and I demanded to delivery food at my flat so. he delivery food and coming to the food it was not so tasty that I was expected I disappointed for that because food is everything right so finally I went to say that swiggy how to improve services in a better manner
Friends I will tell you everything from my personal experience  Friends this app is playing with minds of people as it shows free delivery and 33% off on first order.  Friends I have ordered a pizza of ₹150 from this app after discount from cafe olives sector 59 delhi.  But when I went to same shop it cost me ₹80 for same pizza.  It is all fraud.dont trust this app as it is increasing its income
"Two days before I ordered food from swiggy as we have planned a party but there was a huge delay in delivery fir about 1 hr. App showed that it will be delivered by 30 min but it took 1: 30 hr.  I am highly dissapointed by service because they kept on saying that the order is on way even though it had not been dispached. And I recommend to cancel such parntership from such shops.  I am giving 2 stars just beacause they have variety in food products and every kind of food is available there i.e italian , chinese , french etc.  Quality of food is also not upto the mark for some of their restaurants . I recommend them to take a strick action against them.  Time of delivery is sometimes good while sometimes it as I have already said above ."
I have worst experience in my online order/shopping.  I chase them so many times they refuse to refund or replacement my Order number 13896359055. I called email swiggy they didn't have any positive reply. They running SCAM SCAM scam scam scam scam scam
"Swiggy are becoming worse, rapidly. Terrible delivery experience last 3 times out of 4 orders.  Food arrived cold, and get can only be described as fit for the bin. Impossible to easily contact CS. I've asked asked for a refund but nothing heard. Having spent probably close to 20k on orders in the last 5 or 6 months. Every order being over 1000.  Simple case of over promise and under deliver - literally!  On another note. Swiggy seem hell bent on promoting more and more Non Veg meals. No one has a real clue where the meat is sourced, animal welfare or preparation environment.  Swiggy - the great food delivery swindle."
"Let me talk about my experience on swiggy.com Swiggy just make fool people by taking order and by not to make delivery on time to the customer. Recently I ordered food from swiggy, first of all their customer care service is very bad because they are not available to take your calls any time you call, if someone picks up the call then, he/she does not listen properly what you want to say, so you have to make calls again and again and have to convey your order to every person who take calls. By the time if the food is ordered, then they never deliver your food on time. However the food quality is good, but there is no use if it is not delivered when you want."
When I order food. delivery boy call me n say sir shop is close so u cancel order ok sir. hi tiching me how to cancel order . after 10min one more delivery boy calling me n say sir. mera accident hua hai to main apko order delivery nhi kar sakta. main koi dusra ladka arrenge karta
"Swiggy is one of the worst food delivery app, I have ever had the misfortune to come across. Forget delivering food late, they wont even deliver your order and just send you a text saying it's been delivered. Worse is, forget not delivering your food, sometimes they send drinks which has it's caps tempered with and open.  I wish I could give a big fat Zero star."
"A delivery service that doesn't deliver. They have been delivering to my location from Subway, and all of a sudden they find it far to service. What nonsense. In order to save on delivery time, they have been creating dead zones where they'll not deliver so the stats may say they are doing good on service but in reality they have been just avoiding taking the pain. I am not going to order from them any more."
"Me and my family are using swiggy from last 6 months. They are best in home delivery system. We have tried other online food ordering AAP and also from different sites, some times the restaurant unable to deliver and some time the site people do not even bother to check if u have got the food ordered. But swiggy is awesome, we have ordered a lot of things and they deliver before the timelimit. And we got hot and yummy foods every time we order through swiggy."
"Swiggy as an entity has failed in its fundamental consumer experience that had become synonymous with the brand, when it had begun initially. The idea of bringing the choicest food options to its customer has taken a back seat with the focus only on taking deliveries and not delivering them compounded with incomplete orders. Swiggy was the Uber of food delivery but is rapidly losing its core due to its own incompetence. Although it has knowledge about their particular business but they are very shallow in their execution. This entity has failed to meet the basic expectations of customers and continues to perform at such level, which will eventually take this to a stage of utter failure, where it would even fail to rise. Any business that has a new way of doing things either through technology or people but has no ethics, will eventually close down. Ultimately the motivation behind this business is money so they tend to fail more than the others. It is a disgrace that such entities are not subjected to scrutiny and severe punishments. It is disheartening that Swiggy doesn’t care about customers, to the extent of treating them like afterthoughts and yet expecting payment for services, which were never met."
"I have ordered a king size mutton biryani from Behrouz biryani for dinner. The birayni delivered is of bad quality, no salt. I called Dwight to complaint about the food and the response from the lady at support was that they can't do anything about this.  They are least bothered about the feedback and asked to write whatever you want. Very bad support I must say."
"I have placed an order at 7 pm on 08/07/2018. My order was confirmed by the restaurant and I was being shown a message saying that your order might be delayed because of rains. I have waited until 8.30 pm and when I have seen that the status hasn't been changed, I tried to look for customer support. Sadly the app said there were some technical issues. Even the web page couldn't be loaded. I've called up the customer care number and no one responded. Around 10 pm one of your executives(chat support through app) assigned a delivery executive. That delivery executive called me up saying he would deliver my food around 11 pm. I said it was okay. I waited and checked the status around 11 and again the order was changed back to not assigned and it was cancelled after I again talked to another customer support(chat because no one is lifting the calls) executive of yours. If there were technical issues, why couldn't you cancel my order instead of making me wait and depriving me of food? I stay in a hostel and I now need to sleep hungry for the night. Nice job Swiggy. It was my 1st order here and i'm never coming back again. I'm never letting any of my friends order through this platform. I've been a avid user of Zomato and today I've made a mistake ordering my meal here. I have to sleep hungry because of you guys. AMAZING"
"I ordered food via swiggy on 08.07.2018 in two hours of time nothing progress saying delivery boys are not available. How come this happens very bad service and whom can ask about delivery no customer service, no it seems  ."
"This is the worst done, we ordered for vegetarian subway and u delivered non veg to us. Dont accept booking if cant provide surety of service. U have hurt our sentiments and yes my religious values.i will file a suit against the company. Pathetic service and no response"
"One of the most horrible service and customer support. Happened for 3rd time, finally decided never to order food through Swiggy. Food is never delivered on time. My suggestion to people, to order food on cash on delivery and cancel orders. These people should be given a strong message"
"The worst service at swiggy,  I tried ordering from swiggy on 21st June and due the issue in their app we could not place the order and the money was also debited.when I placed the order again n cancelled the duplicate order, they have not provided the refund yet.  Their Customer Care number is not reachable and moreover whenever u logi to chat with the executive, then each of executives will have different statements and if I am asking the transaction id for refund given, they are not giving nor they are ready to give my money  Worst refund policy why the hell should we place orders from swiggy.  if there are cancellations then dont expect refund from them. Its been 7 days that I have been chasing them"
I have ordered from swiggy website as I don't have app in my mobile. I have entered my home address in the details but the map is showing different address in the swiggy. Delivery person called me and said we r not giving delivery services to ur location so kindly cancel the order. I canceled the order and raised the above issue to the customer service. There was a problem with their app. The address they confirmed was showing other address along with my current address. At last that person said 75rs are claimed and 5to 7days ur delivery services are stopped. I don't want ur stupid services. Try to understand what customers are trying to say. And delivery people not able to talk in English or hindi.
"The information they display on the website, especially for the late-night restaurant, is false. They take the money and later cancel the order letting us know that the restaurant is closed. On top of that they issue refund in 5-7 business days but do not bother about giving alternate solutions. Their service sucks and none of their rep are comptetent to provide the resolution."
Ordered the 34th time at swiggy at 9.19 pm on 24th June and tried to check the order status at 10.32 pm after getting an assurance in the chat at 10.21 pm that it will be delivered asap.  The cancellation status was known at 10.45pm when I do not have any option to get food in the night. I really feel like kicking them. In the second chat the executive offered me a 100 rupee coupon.  I think they are either nuts or do not understand the customer need. It was really a bad experience ever.
"I am using this site for quite long. Had few issues before but not that big but after I moved to a new address, when I ordered for first time the GPS in swiggy set a wrong address in map I didn't notice that and I provided my address in full detail with land mark and placed the order.  But the delivery guy had issue in finding the address as the gps address was wrong. and requested me to cancel the order.  I contacted their help desk and cancelled the address and these guys charged me for their mistake.  Thank you,  Gautam,  8886815716"
If you order any food through Swiggy he will bring food by carrying in his hand. No thermo box.no uniform. The food is delivered in the most unprofessional way.Food is cold and they never have boxes for their 2 wheelers. SWIGGY people have to learn from either dominos or KFC in delivering hygienic way. They are simply cheating people by their unprofessional delivery methods.
I first ordered 19 mini chicken burger and paid Rs 603 on 18 june 2018. After some time one dealer call me and said the item is not available and the order is going to cancel. He told me that I will get the cash back instantly. Till yet I didn't get the cash back. I order some other item on same day. Also after the payment someone call me and said item is not available and the order cancelled by them. Why they allow to make payment if item is not available. Worst app ever.
Today I order food from swiggy.they wrote it will be delivered in 26 minutes.i weighted more then one and half hour after that they wrote me your order is cancelled.then I contact them and they said they will not cancell it and send it again and I weighted again for one and half hour still no food.if they can’t run the company why not to shut down.
"Worst Service Scam Artist, They are worst customer service, worst food served, worst service, very bad company, never ever order anything, They need just your money nothing else from you. Please beware of fraud Star Swiggy.  Scam Artist  Worst Service Scam Artist, They are worst customer service, worst food served, worst service, very bad company, never ever order anything, They need just your money nothing else from you. Please beware of fraud Star Swiggy."
Mobile application picking up GPS location as the delivery address.  Today one of my order went to some other address which the GPS picked up. And delivered later after recognizing that the previous address of Mobile GPS address.  Due to this there was a big delay in delivery
"Its the third time that my order was cancelled by Swiggy in view of the concerned restaurant not delivering the food as they have stopped taking orders after certain time line. This happened after my order has been confirmed by the restaurant. You just can't trust Swiggy as they never deliver to their promises. They would charge you a cancellation fee of Rs 75/- even if it's none of your fault but won't compensate you or charge the restaurant when it refuses delivery. The rider or the delivery boy would call you after about half an hour of placing the order that ""Sir the order you placed can't be delivered as the restaurant is closed for delivery"" and than your hunger for food goes for a six and frustration is all you can have. They are least customer oriented and more restaurant friendly food ordering portal. I would say all the food ordering portals do irritate you some time or the other but never cancel your order just because there is no electricity in one of the biggest chains of restaurants. I would never recommend Swiggy to anybody."
"I used to see so many ads of swiggy and decided to install it 2 days ago. Then placed my first order, and looked forward to dinner. I opened the app and tracked the order. Swiggy agent has reached the restaurant said the status. But that didn't change after half an hour too. Finally called him to know that some other agent has picked up the order and it seemed no one could track him. I called the customer care, they couldn't do anything. Called second time and was assured the other delivery boy would deliver, so waited 20 more minutes. It was now almost 90 min since order placement and the family was hungry. Finally called customer care again and cancelled the order and categorically told that I shall be deleting the app. Have received the refund and deleted app. Will never use swiggy again. Looking for a way to delete account."
"Dear Friends,  Swiggy is one of the best food delivery app which is much faster and authentic compared to other apps. Once you place the order you have the privilege to track your ongoing order.  The Live tracker displays when the food is being prepared and when you the delivery guy picks up the order with live tracking of the delivery status.  I am very much satisfied with the service and on time delivery attitude of the staffs.  Thanks"
This app is very helpful and interface is very easy to use.Filter is applicale so that you can easily search the food according to your choice and need. Delivery is in estimated time and tracking facility is also available . All food variety is available and packing is also superab.  Overall this app is one stop for food lovers anytime.
"If you order direct from the restaurant, they will also deliver to your doorstep, and thier charges are lower than ordering from online site Swiggy. we think because they are offering discounts they may be cheaper but that is not the case.  if you order without a discount, beware that you are paying higer than ordering directly from the restaurant.  so conyinue to maintain the direct nos of restaurants. the websites discount phases are over and they need to make money hence charging extra. the menu proces itself are higher for the same items!"
It has been quite frequently times that once order is placed on swiggy one or the other problems exists with their delivery boys. Like sometimes boys are new or order doesn't reach to the restaurant on time and thein N number of excuses to be Soo late that one doesn't feel to receive the order only  Kindly don't use this app if u want to save your time try other apps like zomato
"Pathetic service by swiggy today. I was starving, and had to put up with the ridiculous staff as well.  I had ordered at 8:49PM and by 10:30PM, the food had not arrived, and the delivery person was unreachable. After calling swiggy 4 times, and being told to wait it out for 5-10 minutes for another hour, we recieved the information that swiggy itself was unable to contact the driver.  I called swiggy yet again and was finally able to cancel the order after numerous attempts. I hope I get my refund.  Horrible service today. I do not recommend swiggy to anybody."
Friends when first time I ordered Biriyani from swiggy the delivery boy bought that very fast in exact time and safely.  at that time I was so hungry then he bought it very safely. then had that very happily. The biriyani was tasty and hot.  he bought from the hotel which I selected. I am fully satisfied with swiggy and I like it. It was the best experience  friends I suggest you all to order your favourite dish or item from swiggy. I it is the best way.  second time my brother ordered when we both were so hungry  then this time also he came in time and safely. the dish we ordered was safe. so it is best my request is once you try it and see then you will know.
"Today I ordered paneer dosa, and I swear that no one can eat this expect animals, it was very shityy food, never go with swiggy, pls dont make us fool by this 3rd class food, .i will never order any food from ur site. food panda is far better then your ."
"Not once or twice, I have ordered thrice and very dissatisfied all the 3 times.  I ordered in Sub Way and it was chill and the outer paper was stuck to the burger and could not eat.  2 times ordered ice creams from Lassi shop(not even 1 K.M from my home) and we in fact drank it. It was completely melted. never ever I would prefer Swiggy again and I wont recommend to others also.  Placed an order once and the dish was not available at that point of time. Overall its worst and guys don't ever prefer this SWIGGY at any cost."
I have order food 2 days back but the food quality was not so good I contact swiggy and inform them they told me we will get back to us but no reply I waste my money for that food I wang swiggy ppl to improve and check the food they are send to customer should be good n worth for that price I felt I order food from road side bad service
"Placed an order though Swiggy app which was supposed to be delivered in approx 45 mins, even after 1 hour when the food did not arrive I tried reaching the delivery representative however he did not pick the call. After few minutes, I received a SMS that food is delivered. When enquired with Swiggy customer care on chat option in their app she asks me to wait for 24 hours. I repeatedly told her forget about the escalation, get me food and she kept on ignoring the request. Finally, the swiggy delivery guy came after 1.5 hours and he was drunk, misbehaved with me and my wife. I have deleted the app and would request all viewers to do the same since swiggy is getting poor day by day."
This is a nonsense app.i have lost my money. No one is bothered to answer. And they will not deliver the food in time. They are looting people. Please be careful. And they wont even display the contact information.on there app. Its really very difficult to get them.will definitely raise this issue in consumet court.
"Delivery executive guys they hire are unreliable.Time n again, I hv ordered from swiggy.Often the delivery guys cancel the order after 10 pm or mark it as delivered, n then u hv to reclaim ur money .They cannot be trusted.  Their support team is good but  whatss the use if they hire such delivery executives.  Also I suggest if u use it after 10 pm then do COD n do not pay using card or net banking.  The delivery charges are much higher compared to ZOMATO  I suggest u use Zomato .Its not worth  Zomato s charges if u around rs 15 to 30 max if u order from a restaurant which is not very far.  Swiggy on the other hand, charges a min of Rs 50 to even 70 for restaurants with in the same distance.  They compensate for late or failure of delivery by providing u coupons of Rs 50 n all but thats not worth the trust u lose .This has happened time n again with me."
Good ontime delivery with lightining speed. I was not expecting but now can say its too good. Really a good app and can be used anywhere anytime whenever hunger disturbs u these guys will really help u . very satisfied by their services ??. I dont know why people give bad reviews but in my case its just awesome
"It faced it couple of times, place your order wait for more than hour then delivery guy not responding to calls. Then call back to customer service, cancel order and get refund.  Pathetic service. Zomato and uber eats are going to capture market soon. Swiggy you are in bad hands. Anyways thank you swiggy:)"
Best experience with food. I have ordered many times from swiggy. I get many offers and also food gets delivered in 15 mins . Obviously the partner's who have joined with swiggy have done a very good job. the entire app is user friendly. The executive who deliveres the food are also very sweet and good.
Swiggy I love because the taste of Biryani was un explained that much tasty ?? and the delivery timings was in time and the offers was quite affordable and the taste was best ever Biryani until now I had eaten and many more options for us and even it was quite good for any time once again Swiggy I love you so much you and your Biryani
I ordered 1.5 hrs ago from Swiggy and spoke with the delivery guy and restaurant guy and did online chat - they are just saying sorry n trying to help.  I'm still waiting for the delivery of my food. I ordered at 8.30 PM  My first and worst swiggy experience.
"I had placed an order on 27th May which was delivered in a manner that I had to throw that food. The issue was highlighted at the same moment on Swiggy's App but no one was available at 22:30 and someone came on that chat at 2 in the night just to tell me that he/she is closing my issue as I am not available, why on earth do you expect me to be available at 2 in the night.  I wrote a mail on 28th May the very next day and received an automated reply that someone will attend to my issue within 12-24 hrs, but here I stand, still waiting for someone to wake up at Swiggy office and help me in my issue.  Best part about Swiggy is which I too got to know now is that you cannot connect to any of their customer care number's if you do not have an active order. Now Swiggy expects us that if we had a problem with an earlier order and if we are dying to talk to them so we should place an order to listen to their sweet voices else they have a chat support where every time you will be welcomed by a new executive and then you will have to tell them your ordeal again and again.  Below is the mail that was sent:  Hi,  This is in reference to an order placed on your app yesterday night. We received the food in such a condition that I would prefer throwing it rather than consuming it, which is what I had to do yesterday all thanx to your delivery executive who had got the food in a bag which was much smaller than the contents in the box.  I had highlighted the same on your app at around 22:30 but I think your running out of staff or your staff was busy with something more important than an agitated customer. To my surprise, I received a msg at 2:24 AM saying that as I am not available to the issue has been closed. Why on earth do you expect me to be awake till 2:30 in the night and when the issue was raised at 22:30 it should have been resolved then and there and not at your leisure. We work on IST and not in any other time frame that you will wake up at 2 and close the issue without even taking the customer permission.  I have attached the pictures for a better understanding and if this is the kind of food and deliver Swiggy will be offering then my friend you have a really long way to go.  Your delivery executives at times are so rude that I really think you need to work on there training as well.  Hoping to hear from you soon and that too in a time frame in which normal people like us are available and not at 2 in the night."
"This is a very large food website containing all items of food and when I and someone orderd something the item of food comes very fast into the house and this is the registered website that is why when I ordered something I purchased from this website and withs website we can orderd a lot of small things also like ( rasgulla, muffin) at last I would like to say that this website is too much good"
"I placed an order on swiggy for ok sweets sector 31, Gurgaon I got the order after more than 1 hour and the breads were missing. Now they are refunding the money of bread. What a should do who is waiting for food till 10 PM. Worst service from swiggy. The delivery person don't even check the order with the bill."
"First time user of the service. Very irresponsible and pathetic service. Just for a kms distance, kept us waiting for 2.5 hrs. The reason being drizzling. The customer care diligently answers the calls, but sadly no use and your valuable time is lost waiting. They inturn tell you to call up the delivery guy"
Best experience with food. I have ordered many times from swiggy. I get many offers and also food gets delivered in 15 mins . Obviously the partner's who have joined with swiggy have done a very good job. the entire app is user friendly. The executive who deliveres the food are also very sweet and good.
"Sales executives are always in vacation, we call with issues to customer service, they tell me to talk to sales person and sales person is on vacation and no one else he would give or suggest to resolve the issue. Utter Bad Service. They dont seems to have interest in dealing with customer issues."
"Their partner restaurant will provide with smelly food and they want us to pay for what I have put in the dustbin and chat department is much worse than that not even giving the detail I am asking repeating the same IVR messages, again and again, don't even have courtesy to understand what I am trying to say as a customer"
"I received a hopeless service today. I got almost 5 calls stating that order is delayed due to hotel issues and then that the delivery boy is unable to reach me etc. fact of the matter was something else. When I spoke to the delivery boy, he said he was at some other address delivering and mine was second. He probably was covering this up with internal status updates that customer was not reachable. It took almost 1 hour 45 minutes to get my order delivered. Funny part is that I also received SMS stating that my order would be cancelled if I did not call the Swiggy number.  Horrible service!"
"Hey friends now am going to review my experience on Swiggy.com. Hope you like it.  The service and support teams works good. But the delivery guys deliver the food late beyond the estimated delivering time.  Without furnishing the availability details of food items, the list out the items as available, and charges the amount.  Low numbers of restaurant availability, low varieties of food, unwanted taxes at some hotels more number of complaints are there to be listed.  Using swiggy via app is giving a hell processing fell. Need patience for using the app or the website.  It's gives a useless feel, then how can I say it's user friendly  Better go to restaurant, and have your food there itself."
"I would like to share my experience of using swiggy food delivery app. I must admit that initially I thought this app is just another substandard app amongst plethora of apps that we get to know regularly. But, to my surprise this one proved me wrong. To begin with, the concept of the app to enable delivery from lical restaurants is commendable.The layout, design and overall interface is quite user friendly and intuitive. All the features in the app makes it a good user experience. Detailed order tracking is really helpful.This app is very useful as one stop shop for ordering food from multiple esting joints within the area. Service is good and food reaches within estimated time."
"I stay in Hyderabad guys and I personally order food from outside a lot so I have used every app like zomato, foodpanda, uber eats but this swiggy app is very different it will give you offers all around the year actually most of the food delivering companies will only give you offer for a month or two then once they attract the customers they will stop giving you offers but in swiggy you will find offers the whole year yes and atleast 30% discount will be there. So I feel that its a very good platform I personally like it because its common sense guys if you can buy a biryani for 130₹ on swiggy then why would you spend 170₹ for the same biryani and that too swiggy will bring the food to you."
The delivery was beyond specified time. The delivery person was trying to locate house despite giving full address and land mark. Packing ok and payment method below average. Delivery person should be more polite and courteous. Do not recommend to any one. H
Its waste of your time ordering on this product. More than 10 orders of my last 15 orders are delivered incompletely.  Delivery boys will not have a basic courtesy of validating the order.  And No one wants to take blame. Neither delivery boys nor the helpdesk  its just waste of time. writing this so trying to save someones time  thanks
"I ordered food from work. They PROCLAIM that they do not discriminate orders by value THEY DEFINITELY DO. The order got confirmed and wait time was 39 minutes. I waited for over an hour and status was that the order is not even picked up. I tried to chat the support, the support guy tells me we have technical issue and we are unable to assign a partner for delivery. So I asked if this will be delivered or not he said NO. Then again he is asking me if I want to cancel the order now how absurd that is. WORST EVER FOOD DELIVERY EXPERIENCE, THEY WONT EVEN INFORM YOU IF TEHRE IS AN ISSUE!"
"We ordered food the amount was INR 220. Now, You are the one who have started this industry, and you know what kinda denomination we have in our country. It is so foolish of you to send the delivery boy without any change. For an amount of INR 220    you get exact change    You get 300 and you return 80    You get 500 and you return 280.      How hard is that to understand. And I had to search for change. It is you right to take up the responsibility and you charge for delivery, and on top of that your delivery boy doesn't have the manner to speak, and says'hum log dukaan nahi chalate' seriously. Besides that it means that you don't even trust your employees that you don't handle them cash or you are all capable enough to maintain an account.  So this is a detractor."
"Swiggy is by far the best food delivery service. I use it frequently and I must tell you, everytime I feel satisfied with the delivery time and stuff like that. Service is fabulous. More often than not, delivery executive are friendly as well. Payment methods offers better convenience for the customers. By far, the best"
I placed an order for a Banna Sundae Royal through Baskin and Robin's with strawberry and mango toppings. The toppings we're absolutely missing though I paid for each and everything and the sundae was no more looking like a sundae when it reached home.
It is a very nice online food ordering site from where you can order your favorite food from near by restaurants.like all other sites it even has an app available on android and ISO. we had a really great and amazing experience. the food that was delivered was hot and fresh . the packaging of liquid items is really good. we are ordering food from this site from a long time. it has foods of all types of cuisine. it has both veg and non veg hotels. we can get all types of food item at our door steps with a fast delivery time . the only disadvantage of this site is that during rains the delivery executives are assigned slowly it takes a little bit of extra time than it usually takes. overall a very nice site to order food online .
"I ordered food at home using swiggy.com website from Kareems restaurant GK1 in delhi at night 10:16 PM . On track order page I saw order got received by restaurant and order started being prepared at kitchen. A delivery executive assigned to order. Everything looked fine and normal. I assumed that order will be delivered within expected time of 45 minutes, and got busy in some  work.  When it became 11:40 PM, I rechecked the status on order tracking page of swiggy.com, it was showing that order is still preparing and some other executive was assigned to the order. Then I asked the swiggy executive over chat that what happened to my order. She told that let me check with delivery executive, and then replied that the restaurant is closed. It came as surprise to me that as per swiggy web application restaurant which has received my order and preparing the order is actually closed. I was without dinner at night. The swiggy executive simply said we are sorry for the inconvenience, and we will process the refund, and told that  restaurant did not conveyed them timely. God knows what is truth, I came to all these when I asked them and they did not inform first hand to me anything.  This is example of big mismanagement and irresponsibility from big name like swiggy."
"The worst app ever. I would never recommend this app to people. Today I ordered a cake on the occasion of mothers day which was 300gm. Swiggy is the best to reuin up your occasion. They sent a cake in two pieces. Even the taste was not so good. It was average. Even the 300gm cake doesn't look like of that weight. Then I asked swiggy to refund me the money at first they declined and said they can replace the same, wherein I didn't wanted that option as it seems like a waste of money. So called them again and asked for refund, other agent said yes refund is possible, she gave me two option bank transfer or card . She promised me the refund and then said I will receive a call back from swiggy for further procedure. Then I received a call from them they started saying the refund is possible but only in the form of swiggy money, which I refused obviously cz I don't want to use swiggy in future. Then the agent kept me on hold and there was no response. In the mean while second delivery boy came to replace the cake and said mam you have to take the cake as it is not cancelled yet. I refused he started talking to swiggy and handed over the cake to me and when back. Then after 10 min he came back n asked back for the second cake he delivered. I gave him back and then again he spoke to swiggy and after 5 min gave the cake back.(Which was of no use worst taste ever)  God knows what was happening I was really fed up of them.  No money was refunded. They are very good at taking the money but not good at refunding it."
"I keep ordering food through swiggy but today's experience is noteworthy. I ordered food for breakfast but since the packing was not okay from the restaurant, all the food got spilt out into the outer cover rendering it useless .called swiggy to give this feedback.within 5-8 mins timeframe, swiggy promptly raised the reorder and got the food delivered also at no cost! Happy with their customer service and will continue to use their services"
"Swiggy I want to share my experience about swiggy, I did not like service because depend on area to area they provide the service and quality is not so good .or great what they say. now a days they are a lot of competition and I don't understand where they are different from other and I am not getting any kind of justification. initially everyone is good and great and in while they lose their capacity to maintain stability. I felt swiggy need to across More offer and treat every area where they deliver on same platform .swiggy need to improve their service menu offer add money more"
Recently ordered a dinner for my daughter from Dwight from a nearby restaurant in lohegaon(hotel Tittos) whr I stay. the bill amount was 238/- and as I did not have exact change I paid 500/- rs to the delivery guy.  Unfortunately he did not have change either.  He promised to send me the balance amt in a while.  After an hour I call him to remind him to send in the paytm he gives a reason that he is driving and shall do it in a moment. then the phone goes off.  I call him next morning he doesn't answer the call.  I approach swiggys customer care on chat and they clearly deny paying my bal amt in the first go. offering me a coupons of 250/-  I denied and when I spoke to the second guy he says it takes 7days to get refund.  I was wondering what if I had to take my daughter out to the same restaurant and had a table dinner in the restaurant pay the same bill the same currency of 500/- m sure the man at the counter doesn't say please come and collect the remaining balance amount in 7days .?? I had attached few pics of chat with these guys.  My concern is why if these guys can take 250/- on one order(LOOT) imagine on 15-20orders a day how much money can they LOOT us.? In a month? In a year? THAT IS HOW SWIGGY MAKES MONEY!
"I placed an order with Swiggy today. The delivery person picked up the order from the restaurant but on reaching a place which is about 2 minutes drive from my house, called me to inform me that he would not deliver the order. I chatted with a Swiggy representative by name Supriya and explained to her the situation. She immediately proceeded to cancel the order without even bothering to talk to the delivery person. I not only lost my money but the order was also not delivered. Tweets to Swiggy did not elicit any response from them.  I would not hesitate to say that Swiggy is the worst food delivery platform. They are experts at taking their customers for granted."
Last Sunday our family went to one function. Full day we were the there. By the evening we reached home and All were tired and hungry. No body is ready to prepare food. Then I have tried to order food online and found this app. Then I have ordered pizza at 99 rs each plus cheese 20 rs. Ordered 4 pizzas. They are offering good offers also. For the first order I for 25% cash back in my Paytm wallet. They have showed time as 30 min to deliver but within 15 minutes they delivered my food. Service also very fast. I liked this app very much.
"For today's lunch, I order chicken fried rice through swiggy app. The rice was totally bad at taste also chicken was not cooked properly. I thought that it might be because of warming climate the rice has got spoiled and may get a bitter taste but what about chicken. Further, the chicken was also not hygienic. I have vomited twice and that is really yuck. I have ordered certain time but, this time my experience was worst. Please improve your standard SWIGGY."
"Hello guys, I am using this site from last 2 years and I am fully satisfied with this site.it give many offers and discounts on food dishes.it bring us food from nearby hotels and parlours at discounted rates.it has many features like tracking, ratings, and many more.You can also get super discount using a coupon code.This is a trustworthy site.I had taken many discounts using this site.This site works in every corner in india.I suggest you to try once."
Most horrible customer service ever  Issue 1: Spoiled food received  Issue 2: Salt in Soup  Issue 3: Wrong Soup delivered  Issue 4: Promised time 45 mins after 1 hour receive a call saying the executive isnt picking well assign another executive and then give a call after making us wait for another 30mins and say restaurant is closed  Issue 5: Show 2 min and deliver after 30mins  Issue 6: Deliver Rock Idlis  Issue 7: Deliver food where the quantity wouldn't be sufficient even for a baby. Guess they served left out food  Issue 8: instead of compensating or making sure customer are happy they throw back Rs.75/- or Rs.100/- as coupon code to satisfy themselves I believ  I will never ever recommend anyone to use swiggy cause they are irresponsible people where they just don't know how to talk to customers or improve there quality.  Oh by the way they have amazing way of cutting people while talking about there concerns - Guess the lady who has the top skills is named Ludia
I ordered food last night from swiggy consisting of 4 items for which I paid in cash on delivry. firstly the food was absolutely cold and the delivery boy was extremely rude. on top of that one item was missing from my order. on contacting the customer care I was told that the missing item was out of stock but still I was charged for it. When I asked for my refund of the item not delivered I was outrightly refused because I paid in cash.
"I ordered a couple of days ago my the swiggy app. Although it was easy to order, the restaurant I ordered from sent a completely amateur person who couldn't locate my home. It was a prepaid order which he took back. He never called to ask my location or to ask directions. He himself cancelled the order and said the money can't be refunded. No customer support and no assistance from their team whatsoever."
"Hi guys! today I share my personal experience on Swiggy.Com. Last few months before me and my family members are went to my uncle house. Then next day, my uncle ordered the food for Swiggy on lunch time and told to delivery on 1-1.30 p.m.  After we are waiting for long time but the delivery boy is not came. Then my uncle call many times to Swiggy, but no response to him. We are very hungry and very disappointed.  After 2.00 p.m the delivery boy came and delivery the food with charges.  The Service and support is very bad, because not support for correct time.  The information depth and content is no use and not good.  This is not a user friendly, it's irritating to me.  Time to load is no chance for a perfect time. It's take much more time to delivery.  I am not suggest to you. If you order the food for Swiggy, you must wait for more more. time.  Thanks for reading my review."
"My order was delayed for over an hour, I got on chat and spoke to the rep called Govind Namdoe and requested cancellation as my cab has come to take me to office. Govind ignored my request repeatedly but when I stayed that I don't mind losing money on this order but I will post on Twitter all the screenshots for this utter useless service, he stated he'll process the cancellation and initiate the refund, he didn't and he kept calling me Naresh, that's not me. I will come on Twitter."
I am a high value customer of swiggy. I don't have any glitches against swiggy but the restaurant partners are worst. After paying so much money the quantity which is provided it's not even worth for a child. We are paying to eat not to taste the food. Swiggy higher management must check with the quantity provided by the restaurant.
"Team Swiggy,  You better shut down your services, you guys are unprofessional and unethical. It took more than 2 hours to deliver food from a restaurant which is a mile away after calling customer care people thrice. And we don't have an option in your app to raise complaint for such pathetic service."
"Issue with Swiggy  Never deliver on time  Let you know incase of order cancelled after 30-40 min of Order placing  Never works in feedback’s  Incase of cancelled orders they never take action on the restaurant. Worst service, go for Zomato, they atleast take feedback and work on it."
"Updated my earlier experience, I received a call from their customer service, taking into account my experience. I was offered apologies and provided a token of appreciation, with the explanation on the new company and an opportunity to learn from the experience. Kudos to the company to take into account customer feedback and value to each customer. Definitely depicts signs of progressive company."
Today I placed and order from swiggy(Order #1172186441). I wanted to cancel the order as I wanted to apply some coupon. as per swiggy guidelines order can only be cancelled without cancellation fee of Rs 75 if order is still awaiting confirmation from restaurants. My order was awaiting confirmation when I called and initiated the chat at the same time. both of them said that there will be a cancellation fee. some of you might be feeling that how mean I am that I am talking about only Rs75 but it is my hard earned money and don't want to waste even a single paisa out of it.  Guys don't order from swiggy.  Kunal Kochhar
"Horriboe service, horrible communication from the executive, horrible delivery. Had to cancel the order from one swiggy account because they are not sure about their own orders and delivery boys they have no track of their own orders. The help desk people cant even communicate well."
"I have ordered from swiggy. but its not able to delivered the food on address.  Swiggy has not maintain the basic functionality to track the customer's Address.  and customer is not able to change that location.  I have ordered from Iscon circle(Ahmedabad - Gujarat) and Swiggy has rectify the location from 10 km away.  How can this possible?  Guys Pls dont order from swiggy, ZOMATO is far batter then this Swiggy."
"Have ordered from swiggy kadai paneer they delivered me panjabi chicken, when I contacted to customer care they told will companset with this issue as a 150 rs cupan, just think who never had chiken for them they are sending chiken. very bad experience."
"Ordered and realized the same moment that address was wrong, support guys could not help. Delivery boy asked extra 100 rupees and your support guy kept informing that delivery boy will come. Finally ordered was delivered somewhere(no clue where) and money was deducted too. Swiggy runs a scam."
"IT SHOULD RATHER BE CALLED CUSTOMER HARASSMENT OR ""LETS INSULT THIS GUY"" TEAM  Dear Swiggy Team,  After multiple attempts to reach the support team and escalations team regarding multiple dissatisfied experiences at Swiggy, including yesterday with order number  Order #1170222956  and 2 days ago with order number  Order #1168100412  and then before that with  Order #1166260379 and then with  Order #1163176293  and the list goes on and on and on.  I have finally decided to give up.  I am tired of getting insulted by Swiggy call center employees who treat their customers like idiots, impersonate being a supervisor and hand over the phone to their neighbor who does not even read the query, does not know how to talk in a proper language and don't hesitate in making me wait for hours on hold and mute before just hanging up on me.  Your customer support teams have absolutely no regard or value for customers time and test patience at every step.  Everytime, I finally mAnasultange to reach a supervisor; I have been thrown with a bone(your team calls it coupons or refunds) as if someone was doing me a favor by providing these to me.  And with Apologies that no one meant a dire bit.  I have been a daily and loyal customer with Swiggy, giving business to your company almost every single day.  I treat my teams at work with tit bits from your site and keep them motivated but off late the embarrassment has gone to a different level, where I announce a treat for my team and order from swiggy, but the swiggy team being the most consistent in screwing up things, fails me in front of my entire team, leaving me shamed and helpless spending hours on the phone or chat with the swiggy support team.  Its a punishment I get every alternate day for ordering food and other snacks from Swiggy.  I have finally decided to take my business elsewhere.  Please send me instructions to delete my Swiggy Account.  I no longer wish to give business to your company as I am convinced your team and your company does not believe in customer service and satisfaction.  Today I had to spend more than 3 hours on the phone and chat to finally get Vivek who is the only person who seems to be honest and courteous who told me he will do something, but unfortunately Vivek told me the same thing 2 days ago as well when he handled my previous escalation.  So, I clearly see your employees and supervisors are helpless as they can't do anything about your failures and are there to just bare the brunt of customers wrath like mine I guess.  So please do the needful to delete my Swiggy Account.  I do not wish to use this pathetic service anymore and will be more than happy to take mine and my teams business to a company which cares for my business and values it.  Thank you   I HAD ATTACHED PHOTOS TO THE BELOW MAIL AS WELL  To: support@swiggy.in  Cc: sriharsha.majety@swiggy.com  Bcc:  Date: Thu, 28 Sep 2017 00:30:00+0530  Subject: Fwd: Your receipt for Swiggy order 1109271790 from Sep 27, 2017  ATTN: Syed / Sriharsha(WRONG ITEMS SHIPPED)  Hi Syed,  As discussed with you, please find photos attached the pictures for the  food received today. My concerns.    Ordered for Non-Veg Fried Rice - Received Veg Fried Rice    Ordered Veg Dragon Rolls - Received Non-Veg dragon rolls(a pure      vegetarian ended up eating non-veg during Navarathri Pooja. This has not  only offended his religious and spiritual sentiments but also left him  shell shocked on the blunder and how someone could take such a sensitive  issue so carelessly)    Looking at my previous 10 orders and having experienced issues on at     least 5 of them, I am trying to understand why Swiggy has not taken any  remedial measures to fix these recurring issues.    Why is food ordered from Swiggy coming in boxes labeled as Zomato?     @Sriharsha,  I might not be the biggest customer but I have been a loyal customer to  Swiggy despite the constant disappointments that I have had with my  experience when using Swiggy. I continued to ignore them assuming that  every time a supervisor gave me nhassurance and renhassurances that they will  ensure this does not happen the next time, there was someone actually  working towards ensuring the issues I faced would not be experienced by me  or any other customers. Unfortunately, all I got in return for my loyalty  and providing continued business to Swiggy was disappointment.  I am escalating this to you and bringing this to your attention because I  have tried all channels of trying to find resolution to this ongoing  behavior of poor service but I have failed to find resolution. I am hoping  that by highlighting the history of my order records, it might bring in  some improvement in the way Swiggy is mAnasultanging their services currently and  will throw light on the current state of service. Also, I am looking for  resolve on the sensitive issue of delivering non-veg food to a vegetarian  claiming it was vegetarian which has hurt someones religious feelings to  which apologies are not good enough anymore. ??  I am very keen to understand what is Swiggy going to do to ensure other  customers including myself do not experience this again?  Kindly help and advise."
"Disgusting customer service experience, why do you make someone wait for 2+ hours and then say we cannot deliver, are you guys so much less connected to understand the real-time delivery situation? what technology are you guys using? high time you guys value your customers, competitors aren't less, for sure myself and at least good amount of my networks will stop using your below third-grade service. Not using you guys is the best way to diminish such poor service from the crowd. STAND IN THE CORNER"
"ORDER ID 1169538984  Seven Shawarma& Burgers  I had placed an order for 14 Classic Falafel Wrap and 1 Classic Chicken Shawarma Wrap, I found 2 Cockroaches in the food and packing.  I had mailed them for refund but they are not responding, and the chat is also not acknowledged."
Hi there  in my previous review I have deleted the app due to some issue I was facing with my account with swiggy  as the upgradation of the app with asap option is quite tempting with faster delivery  further I would rather suggest swiggy to add a message notification as well just for in case the food item is not available with the shop at that time so that it can reduce the time of wait for the customer and he can order from different restaurant asap  it just for the suggestion which I want to put forward with swiggy  rest all I find is good going with swiggy  thanks & regards  Amrit sahay
"Just now I ordered food and within 20 minutes they delivered it.when we are doing veey first transaction, we can apply promocode swiggy33 and can enjoy 33% discount upto rs.100. moreover, we can avail this offer even on cash on delivery.  If we go directly to the restaurant, we cannot enjoy this much discount.travelling expenses, tips etc. Will be additional expenses."
I ordered through Swiggy for Domino's pizza and after a couple of hours they marked it as delivered through food was not sent.  Called up Swiggy customer service and they said I had to follow up with Domino's myself!  On escalation the manager informed me that he will process a refund within 72hrs and no apology!  Never order from Swiggy when they do not take the delivery responsibility.  Experience is pathetic.
"I ordered my food but due to some reason I want to cancel it, swiggy dedtucted 75 rupee as their cancelleation policy but remaining ammount they did not returned till now .  Please do not order something from swiggy, if u r doing then pls do not do on line payment .  Worst service provider company . They didnt response as per my complain, I tried many time. Maybr they could share our Debit and credit card details, I have no faith at swiggy service . Poor company, you are not so big in market that u r doing such little thing ."
I placed an order from swiggy as I was very hungry after 40 min delivery boy denied to place my order in my location. Than I called the delivery executive. Even he seems like help less in front of the delivery boy. And told me within 5 min my sinior executive will call u and I got call after 20 min and sinior executive told me ur order will be canceled. He can't do anything. And they canceled my order after more than 1hr. Very pathetic service and customer handling.
Hi. Now a days there are many online food app is there like food panda pizza hut dominoz however swiggy by showing its add got some popularity that they take order for smallest meal so we gave it a try by ordering small meal I must say the concept change from good to bad 1st they dnt deliver on time 2nd the food quality is not that good 3rd no reversal if u found that that your ordered food is not good. Not all things are bad but most of the thing is not good. Instead we should try food panda. Bad experience
"I have ordered food Rupees 347, order number #1168623577. The food quality is really very bad and there is no option for feedback or rating against the restaurant. The restaurant name is ""Kaleva"".  Please don't order from here.  Below are the restaurant details:  Kaleva  Shanker Vihar Laxmi-Nagar  ORDER #1168623577| Sat, Apr 21, 9:38 PM"
"I have ordered food on weekend for lunch.When I checked for order delivery time it is mentioned as 30 minutes.  I waited for almost an hour. I have not received any call from delivery boy or swiggy. it is very disguss with the swiggy service. later when I ping to customer service, he cooly answered that restuarant was closed and not taking any orders. He asked me to reorder the food.  After all my hunger lost I finally rebooked the order and received by 3: 00 pm.  Very pathetic service by swiggy."
I placed an oreder by mistake I straight way cancelled it but they delayed and when the delivery boy reached the hotel they said 75 rs would be taken which is not acceptable at all swiggy  On that point they closed my cod option cash on delivery for next 5 to 6 prepaid orders
Order cancelled with details as that hotel was non operative. We placed order and then we got a call that the hotel we choose is not operative.  That was pathetic that it took again for us new time to invest for placing order.  I will not recommend it to others.
"Subject pre paid order was delivered wrong. While I asked for 1 Anjir ice cream(family pack)+ 2 choco chips(cup) ice cream, Swaggy delivered exactly opposite I.e. 1 Choco chips( family pack)+ 2 Anjir(cup) ice cream.  Worst part was.there was no clue on return. Complete excitement of kids& adults for the evening was spoiled by Swaggy's"
"Ordered from Swiggy for Gianis ice cream estimated time was 45 mintues, just before delivery estimated time it said order cancelled! Very disappointed! Don't think I will ever use this app again. It's a complete waste of time.  Will not recommend to anyone!"
"I booked food from Swiggy on 14th April for the Bengali New Year Day on 15th April for my family and guests. The order no. is #1165192429(Paid in advance). Scheduled delivery time was between 1-1.30pm on 15th April. The food was ordered from Kasturi Restaurant, Kolkata.  At 1.45pm on 15th April I called up Swiggy for the status of my food delivery, as no one called me within my scheduled delivery time. To my utter surprise Swiggy delivery person informed me that Kasturi Restaurant is not cooperating with Swiggy and is declining to deliver the ordered food.  After reaching Swiggy HO in Bangalore I got the same feedback around 2.30pm. By that time guests and family members at my house started feeling frustrated as it passed the lunch hour. Kids started complaining. It was a total face loss and utter harassment for me.  It was around 2.35pm after I spoke with Swiggy representative at Bangalore, Ms Gautami, she conveniently stated that she is cancelling the order and refunding the money which will be credited to my account after 4 business days.  This entire act shows that Swiggy has no control on the principal food supplier and complete failure of its Effective Operation Management.  I will never ever book food through Swiggy and will discourage all my friends, colleagues and relatives to use Swiggy, who not only does not care for its customers but also doesnt have basic courtesy to inform customer about its inability to deliver the food within the stipulated time of delivery.  I will surely take this up strongly to the Consumer Court, as I have all the corrosponding evidences and also would spread this in Social Media to make other aware of such unethical practices.

Swiggy is best compared to other app I would.  On time delivery  Best customer service  I would recomend you guys to order at night after 10 pm then I would bet there won’t Be any issues .  The number one in chennai now.  Swiggy is best compared to other app I would.  On time delivery  Best customer service  I would recomend you guys to order at night after 10 pm then I would bet there won’t Be any issues .  The number one in chennai now.  And it also depends on the restuarent That u order and it’s not a fault of swiggy.  If it’s a fault on restuarent that u ordered than give negative feedback on the restuarent and not on swiggy.  Check oly on time delivery on swiggy.
Giving wrong deliveries and not giving refund. Worst worst worst. I had ordered jain food and they delivered food with onion garlic twice. They are not refunding money now. It is such a worst experience. Do not ever use this app. Zomato is far better
"Horrible experience with swiggy multiple times. App shows 35 mins, but this guy took more than an hour. Other time, app was showing different address and delivery boy reluctant to deliver at correct address. I recommend not go for swiggy. Dsssssssssss"
"Hi friends I'm reviewing Swiggy.  I would say that Swiggy is very WACKY because I'm not satisfied with them. I have used their service and it is the worst.  It takes so much time to order food on Swiggy and it takes even more time to deliver the order.  The website or the app is not very convenient to make orders. The interface should be more prominent and interactive.  The delivery guys are not Sweet and they are rude on us.  May be people will fall for their orders and the less delivery charges and they are not true at all.  Now, let's see about the details and specifications.  Service and support: They definitely don't provide good service and support.  Information depth: The information depth is not very sufficient.  Content: The Content on the website or the app is absurd and not clear.  User friendly: They are definitely not user friendly because the delivery? guys are rude to the customers.  Time to load: They take very very long time and the food becomes cold sometimes and the reasons they give for being late are very lame."
This is regarding order number 1165802287 ordered on 15 April 2018. It was a pathetic experience. We ordered food at 8:30pm and received another incorrect order at 9:15 pm for which we requested replacement. We contacted the delivery boy(yogesh) after 45 minutes and got to know he had reached a different location which seems in between restaurant location and our location. He denied to come further beyond that point because incorrect address is reflecting in his app. We contacted the customer care and they agreed that we have entered the correct address(GPS location) in the app(flat number 506 sector 21 d Palmwood Estate) but denied to deliver our order for the technical issue they had at their end. It's been more than 2 hours and now at 11:15 pm they have denied to deliver our order. Please guys don't ever order from this app as once they receive money they are not bothered about their customers. Please share the bad experience with everyone so that no body is be fooled by them. Please contact me at 8447738328 if need further clarification.
"I ordered Biryani from Aromas hydrabadi biryani Pune kothrud, it was granted that this order will be delivered in 30 min but even after 1.30h this order not delivered.

And after 1.45min they cancelled my order such a bad experience I not going to order here onword"
"I have ordered 4 items vide order#1165559795 at 5.36 pm on today, 14 the April, 2018 for delivery between 7.30 to 7.45 pm on today. At around 7.30pm swiggy team called me and the took the Banglar Heshel restaurant person in conference call, and both of them told that they couldn't provide 2 items from my order, They asked me to cancel the order or revise the order. I told them that I have ordered around 2 hour, so they should update me about that problem instantly. But they behaved wrongly with me. Mainly the restaurant person was very rude and even they denied to acknowledge their mistake. And at around 8.20 pm swiggy/Banglar Heshel restaurant has cancelled my order without intimating me. So I will request to all the customers to be alert before placing any advance order to swiggy as well as to Banglar Heshel restaurant. Regards-Kuntal Dutta(9836111157) Baghajatin, Kolkata"
"I was at Swiggy for some supper today. I ordered Kerala Chicken. it was really soft and tender, with minimal spice, as I was expecting. Ali was in charge of our table and I must say he was really nice and polite. He made my experience at Swiggy really worth trying:)"
"Dear One's  I would like to share my extremely pathetic experience with Swiggy where in I ordered my food from one of channel partner of swiggy by the name of(Punjabi's Eating Club). Now first of all this restaurant waited me for 10 minutes for accepting my order number(1165109692) then I contacted swiggy chat room just to make my order accepted, hence it's accepted due to my intervention then on an above the delivery guy delivered my order in one hour time as when I spoke to delivery executive he said I have to deliver one more order which is after my location so I waited for one hour.  Really disappointed by Swiggy App"
"The quality of food delivered by swiggy and the restaurants vary a lot.  If you buy through swiggy, the quality gets worse.  Also, the customer care is arrogant.  I ordered an email amounting 375 and when I contacted the delivery boy, he said he has no cash.  I called customer care for that and she said -"" there is no option and delivery can't be made and no cash exchange is possible if you have rs.500 note"".  I said "" they can't give 125 exchange""  ""Not possible"", customer care replied  Me - "" Do you want me to cancel?""  C- ""its upto you sir""  Me - ""OK cancel""  C - "" you will be charged cancellation fees""  Me- "" It is for your problem, I am cancelling""; not mine's""  C- ""very sorry sir.can't help""  I simply uninstalled the app post conversation!  What you guys are doing!  Also, twice I had to throw CHICKEN ITEMS as they were rotten!  They do not take your feedback.  They just pretend to do.  Also, After eating for 5-6 days, I had to report to doctor and then I realized what they are doing in the names of feeding people.  They have 30-40 minutes time constraint and for that reason, the delivery boy pick up old/ sometimes rotten food.  Please cook by yourself/ find some alternative.  Swiggy is BIG NO!  Message:  To all my bachelor brothers and sisters who don't have options, please learn cooking.!"
"Swiggy is online service in which you can order food from the restaurants. But the actual problem starts when you order something in it.Even though you give the exact address for delivery, the delivery person can not give tye delivery in exact time specified at the time of order. If you do not have anyother things to eat you need to suffer with your hungry.And you should to a nearby place to receive the delivery and you can not get at your door step for many times. Better do not go for it unless it is soo important"
"I have ordered from KFC 2 rice bowl and hot wings and they have missed my food(1 rice bowl) when I asked delivery guy to go and pick my missed item he said very rudely that I will not go to pick your missing item you can check with customer care .  Later I caller customer care and one lady Rajni she has picked my call she was not ready to help me and she said I cant give you ypur missing meal only refund I can give .  I told her what I will do with your refund, I can not eat however she was least bother about me .Its not first time . It happend 3, 4 time with me . Very bad customer service .I told rajni I want call back from your manager in 15 min she promised me that she will arrange but no cal from swiggy,  Idiot and robotic staff . they should learn and work on customer service"
I recently ordered food from Domino's via swiggy 4 days before.I paid money from my pocket.but did not receive the food yet.the best thing is after two hours of delivery.the status automatically got turned into delivered automatically.when I contacted swiggy they hold no responsibility.when same thing happened with food panda two years before.they immediately refunded my money.and also said sorry for what has been happened.which is basic custom.i immediately removed this app. I suggest don't go for these small apps becoz each penny is worth for us.I lost 208 rupees including delivery charges for a delivery which never took place.
"Plz never ever us swiggy they guys are unprofessional and bad customer support, they will not help you with your any query regarding any order, they always deliver fake item menas you will not get that what you ordred , and when u asked for the replacement they will take 3 hours to deliver replacement and, you will again recieve the wrong item thats all swiggy policy and when you asked for the refund they guys will o deniy to give the same, overall they are fake foodpanada is more better then swiggy . worst customer support worst service wprst company ."
I was goin through fasos menu which was showing rajma hf kg at 128 rs aftr swiggy discount. When I went on to the bill it was showing 170 so I got confused and went back n to the bill again. By mistake I selected the confirm option n immediately I selected the cancel option. I selected the option given order plaCed by mistake. They gave me ap option to call bt the no wasn't available. They gave me a chat option but there was no one ro chat with. Then they confirm the order with the restraunt n then nayak comes online. He says order wasn't cancelled. I sent him snapshots. He threatens me to cut 75 rs cancellation charges n I will not hv the cash on delivery option henceforth. Wtf. Wt kiNda attitude. Y would I ever order frm u guys aftr such pathetic treatment.
"I ordered an ice cream at 9.27 pm. The tentative delivery time was said to me 49 minutes. The order was picked up from the store around 9.50 pm. I kept on chasing the delivery guy and he came to my house around 11.15 pm with melted ice cream. I tried reaching the customer care, dropped so many chat msg but no bothered to reply.  He delivery person told me that he had 4 orders to delivers. It is not his fault but the system and mechanism swiggy is having is absolutely non professional.  The best part. I get a call from Swiggy around 12.20 am to check.  Please do not trust these guys."
"I had ordered Pomegranate juice. And I received some mixed fruit juice, which on top of that was spoiled. Fruit used in it was chikoo which was rotten, The juice was smelling and the taste was aweful.  The customer care is not ready to listen and understand this, they are not even compensating for it.  They only want people to pay them money. Dont go with swiggy, Uber eats is much better in service and they value their customers."
The most worst app that I could find till date to order my food is swiggy. The delivery executives and the customer care executives are very unprofessional. Even they know that the customer service is the priority then too they don't care about it. I ordered my food and the delivery executive spilled all the food and was standing like dumb over that place for around 20 min. Then I called him asked the matter then the guy told me about the issue. This is so insensitive on their part. We waited for the order for around 1 hour 20 min and then they tell us that the food cannot be delivered. Worst app and would never recommend anyone to use the app.  People out there those who are using this fraud app please uninstall it so that they come to know what it takes when you don't provide services and respect to your customers.
"Very unprofessional company. I ordered for food, it came in late and then the delivery boy had no bill or invoice for the order. Also he asked me to pay more . When I called Swiggy helpline they are very unprofessional and don't want to understand the customer issues. All they want to do is beg you to take the order and pay them more. Bunch of CHEATS AND THIEVES"
"I am a prestigious and a consistent customer of swiggy and with heavy heart I am writing this because I am very found of swiggy but it was one incident which made my experience worst as once I ordered of some curry and cancelled it due to its time taking so for my next order they gave the cancellation charges. It was bullshit to know that I cannot order for my next until I pay the previous charges, there should be some way to tackle this from swiggy. I also told one of the executive to keep that charges on my name as it is and take my order without previous charges but they didn't have any solution for that. I don't think that I would prefer swiggy anymore, we've N number of app to deal."
"The response time of customer support team is very large. Chat support is most pathetic I have ever seen. While chat they took ages to respond. They can not resolve any app/coupon related issues, each and every time they say that try uninstalling the app then again install it. After you do this then again next time some other executive will be on call and they say to do the same. Apart from app/coupon related thing if you contact them regarding some problem with the food they say that this time they can not do anything and they have taken a feedback of the same and will ensure that it will not happen again in future and then you face the same thing repeatedly."
I got order from swiggy. That was in very bad condition. Everything got mixed due to spillage issue.I sent them picture and asked them for refund. They are not helping me out in this .I am attaching the same image here.On chat they dinied to help me out. Tgey assured me that I would get a call from from swiggy within 24 hours .It has been 36 hours I didn't get any call.Guys dont use Swggy.
I am writing this review because I had a very good experience by taking services of swiggy. I ordered 15 times in last 1 month and I am confident to say that it's the best platform for ordering online food. Swiggy covers almost every restaurant with a large variety of dishes along with fast delivery. The interface for ordering food was very easy.
"Delivery guy did not have clue of the address and was arrogant on the call and did not respond properly. Very aggressive behavior. Will not recommend Swiggy to anyone and will not use it anymore. Worst delivery I have seen till now. When asked about delay in finding the address, the delivery guy started saying that he was at the address. I found that he lied to me and was angry on me and I had no clue for what? I think Swiggy is careless about its customers."
I order food executive delay in delivery and mobile switched off. I haven't taken help from customer care chat option I am telling about my concern customer care he took long time to reply and I said I am not satisfied with the service he said theta great and replied back thanks and have a great day they don't know how to treat the customers try to teach him properly and how to respond to clients
To check service & food of the Swiggy first time it was very very very poor service.  They delivered after 2 hrs. And they mentioned only 50 mins. Their customer care is also giving wrong time.  To check service & food of the Swiggy first time it was very very very poor service.  They delivered after 2 hrs. And they mentioned only 50 mins. Their customer care is also giving wrong time.
After placing order I got a message that swiggy tried to call you but no response. I did not receive any call from them. I tried to call back numbers are not reachable. First time I came to know that online orders can be this much complicated. I better to continue ordering from Zomato. Horrible experience. I never recommend any one to this Swiggy. For review 1 star is must otherwise it worth 0 star.
"I have been a frequent user of swiggy. The delivery is fast and the app is hassle-free and user-friendly. They also have exciting offers and deliver all kinds of food.  They customer service is also good. Unfortunately, once I had received stale food, and they refunded me the product price to my account almost instantly after complaining. They are extremely prompt and respond quickly to complains."
"I ordered for biriyani the other day.  The landmark happens to be 1.1 km away from my house and the delivery boy denied to deliver it after I waited for 1 hour because the ""landmark"" is 1.1 kms away.  How can he expect the landmark to be at the location? It is my house and it would'nt be called a landmark!  The delivery boy asked me to call swiggy customer care. I called them and the lady put me on hold for 23 mins.  I tried chatting with the customer care and they ""denied the service"" because the delivery boy does not want to travel for the extra 1.2kms. I am so sorry that I am making your delicate delivery boy travel for extra 1.2kms according to you. Why dont you check the address before making a complete judgement. Or the least you can do is inform the person you are denying the order a lil earlier than 1hour 30 mins!  The delivery boy was so disgusting and he behaved like he owned the company. He uses very disgusting language and I cannot believe such people exist and worse swiggy hires them.  It is very sad to have men like that around. Please specially women dont order from swiggy. It is a very unsafe place,"
Its a very reliable application. Gives many offer to buy from your nearby favorite restaurants. Easy to select food and apply coupons and easy to get delivery at your home. Delivery service is good. Food delivers soon in the given time period. Although you just have to place the order and just sit back. Really great services
"A person orders food coz he is hungry and when you see the food is not what you ordered then it is definitely not a good feeling. I had ordered for Karabath, Kesari bath and Vada. What I received is 2 kesari bath and Vada. Initially I thought it was a mistake and I raised the issue. Response I got was shocking, they said they had no stock so alternatively they send kesari bath. I still dont understand how can they decide on what I want to eat. They are just giving me scripted responses and at the end they have refunded Rs25. What a cheap service, I dont want the refund all I wanted was food. If they dont have the stock then they should have called me and checked with me and who the hell are they to decide on what I will eat. How can a person eat two kesari bath that too in the morning."
"Please be cautious while placing order with SWIGGY.COM.  1) They are accepting the order and cancelling after 30-45 minutes and deducting Rs.75/- for the cancellation.  2) Today I have placed an order and after 2 hours they are saying that the order can't be delivered as your location is 13 kms away. While I asked for the reason. Swiggy representative Mr. Chethan replied that we can't deliver food at Vittal Malya Road whereas the order was placed from Vimanapura, HAL area and its GPS issue.  Finally they said that the food can't be delivered but we will generate the coupon for you thru which a new order can be placed. Till now they have not yet generated any coupon for me nor they have refunded my money.  Seems SWIGGY grabbing money from the customer like this.  My Question to SWIGGY  1) When you cant deliver the food then why you have accepted the order?  2) Why are you updating the customer after 2 hours?  3) Why you are not refunding customers money?  4) Why customer will suffer for your GPS - Apps issue?"
HORRIBLE. From the past 3-4 times I’ve used swiggy it’s been really bad! But today it just crossed the limit when the delivery boy cancelled the order without contacting me even though the order was paid for Online.  The costumer care lady hamsa was hopeless. She kept trying to close the conversation and was of no use. They refused to refund on swiggy money and also deducted half the amount
"Very very poor service, do not waste your money if you are clever, go with other services.  Yeakkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk"
I am very dissaponted with swiggy because of its delay in food delivery and the quality of food. actually one day I want to eat non veg. so ordered in swiggy a chicken drum sticks and tangdi kebab. I was waiting for food but they getting very late. after sometime they call me and saying the delivery boy was st down of my appartment and he was saying that to collect my order at down of my appartment. its reduclus and I refused to do soo and I demanded to deliver food at my flat. so he delivered food and coming to the food it was not so tasty that I was expected. I dissapointed for that because food is everything right?. so finally I want to say that swaggy have to improve their sevices in a better way.  thank you all
"Hello People, be alert always.  Like to share a very bad expereince with swiggy.  I recently ordered food from swiggy for the 1st time, I did my online payment but I didnt get any bank dedcution messege, and I got my orders, then the delivery boy started asking money he hurried me like anything and took my money since this was my 1st service I though it was cash on home delivery, after a day I got deduction messege from bank, I got to know that SWIGGY delivery boy has cheated and robbed me, then I tried to reach customer support, these customer support people were very very unprofessional they didint answer any of questions. I tried to reach the number which I got a call from that delivery boy, people who answered my calls spoke so rudely and threatened me almost like 3rd grade rowdies, where are we? what did I do wrong? even I didnt know how or I dint get deduction messege how can a delivery ask money? something fishy I never got deduction messege so lately for any order! also I dont know with how many people this kind SWIGGY delivery boys cheated! how swiggy is so irresponsible, food panda is far more better than swiggy, food panda delivery people came though so much rain with 5-10 minutes delay, very poor customer support, customer support people are highly unprofessional.delivery boys are highly indiscplined, still I didnt my money."
The delivery guys are not at all trained in any way. The customer support is non existence none of the customer service helplines are reachable. Writing email feedback is of no use they just reply with a template.  Had reported via email about a case of rash driving and abusive delivery person with the vehicle number as the customer service numbers are never reachable. Didn't receive any reply.
"Hello everyoneI am a regular user of swiggy for past few months.Today only I ordered something through this app.  This works on wonderful concept of getting delivered your meal without any hassle with a minimal delivery charges.Its great that you dont have to think about minimum amount of order that is compulsory with most of the restaurant if you want your food to be home delivered.ordering through this app is very simple and easy and they have most of the restaurants and bakeries and food joints connected with the. So you can order from wide variety of menu available to you on single platformAnd they have this excellent gps tracking of your order, so you know where and which stage it is actually.Delivery also is always on or before time till date.I found staff to be very well behaved and professional. Once I had this order in which meal was not prepared well, when I complained they delivered the same meal again without taking any charges, which is wonderful.So I found this app to be extremely useful for small hunger or full meal.4 out of 5 star to this app"
Guys never buy anything from this swiggy online site because they're a big frod frod frod company who make there money through this site.when u give any order through this site they will not deliverers you your complete order and when you want to contact them they don't provide you any no. Where u can register complaint.after that when your total amount of the product u ordered was already deducted from your account then in that situation u will be panic and try to find swiggy's complaint no. But they cheated you .so please never buy anything from swiggy food site. thanks
"Swiggy is one of the best apps serving hot and delicious food. One Saturday night around 11pm few unexpected friends of my husband came over my house.  I was in a state of confusion thinking what should I serve them. Since it was too late and all the restaurants near me were closed, I decided to order food from swiggy.  The food came within 30 mins and I was able to track my order from the time I ordered it to the time it got delivered. The entire process was been able to tracked down. There was no restless and unwanted phone calls to the restaurants.  The food which was delivered was hot. I ordered some Italian food with desserts. It was really tasty. Moreover the items were individually packed so I had no worries about the cleaning of plates and clearing off any mess??  The mid night service of swiggy has helped me and my husband from facing embarrassment in front of his friends.  At the end the guests were happy and so was my husband. He looked into my eyes and said I love you sweetheart, you are the best  I'm so grateful to swiggy. I would recommend all my friends to try and order food from swiggy whenever needed. It's easy as well as comfortable also.  Thank you."
Everyone it's a request please start giving 1 star to swiggy on play store or app store then maybe they will start taking their customera seriously otherwise they will do the same thing to everyone. Their customer service is pathetic their delivery service is pathetic and after one order they will disable cod option. They will never fulfill your request and never ever resolve your problems thorough customer service. So please?? start giving 1 star to swiggy then they might change their policy. #1?swiggy
"I ordered before 2 hours and still there is sign of any delivery service even after following the customer care, no response. And it is happening 3rd time in one month.never going to use Swiggy. Why they take order when not able to deliver it, Customer make plans not to come at home and have something good by order. What you people spoiled everyine mood."
"Ridiculous service.  Pathetic customer service& most unhelpful exectutives. On call Adil, his supervisor Ravi and on chat sourabh& sandesh none of them were of any help at all.  Even after 2 hours of placing the order didn't receive the order and then I was constrained to finally cancelled the order which they cancelled immediately without any qualms. Extremely disappointed .  They also lie about the delivery boy being at the restaurant whereas he is no where close."
"I am extremely disappointed with repeated delivery delays, lame excuses when the call center is called, just a dumb response that escalation manager gets in touch in 24 hrs, and a few choicest swear words that I would like to avoid.  It doesn't matter what vision Sriharsha has, and what glorified startup journey we get to read. if there is no sense of ownership from the company, you are bound to perish."
"Today morning I have ordered dosa from royal tiffens, it was not a dosa its like a papad I never seen this type of bad food in my life, no one can say it is dosa worst food iam not recommending this tiffen centre to any one I got a very bad experience  Apart from that I have a good experience with Swiggy"
"I have ordered two chicken burgers from meat and eat, Saidabad through swiggy.They have delivered me two veg burgers and when I contacted the customer executive regarding this issue, he told me they will give coupon code. They havent provide any coupons and closed the claim.very pathetic support"
"I ordered some food items via swiggy today. I had given instructions clearly specifying'no chillis' which swiggy promises to let the restaurant know! However, the food had a lot of chillis making it inedible and it had to be disposed. I complained to swiggy and they are only offering a rs 30 coupon while the order was worth rs 220! Never ordering from this crappy app again!"
"I haven't ever encountered such a bad service ever. First, the delivery service agent was so impolite and arrogant. Next they delivered wrong items to me. Seriously people, never go for swiggy. My review is over here. Here I'm writing more just to fulfil minimum 250 characters of swiggy."
"We should stop using their pathetic service to teach them a lesson that consumer isn’t a fool.  Lately they had revised their delivery policy without any information to the consumers.  According to which, if you order any food item from any restaurent, they’ll charge you delivery fees but keep collecting orders from the same restaurents or nearby food joints. And direct their delivery boys to make multiple deliveries at the same time.  This policy is only to increase their profit share by reducing the cost & charging delivery fee from every customer but ruining your experience as you would get cold food everytime you order.  So look for other options & stop using their service.  Zomato being a market leader & has their services worldwide never does this unethical stuff.  Images of their chat attached."
The swiggy.comis very good in some areas but in my area it dont give delievry thats why I am giving it two star one time in my uncle's house I order a pizza it come's after 3 hours ofodering and the pizza become very cool so we have to hot it.but sometime it gives good food so if you are living in a good area where delevery is aviable then you can go for it.
"I ordered few items along with Chilli Chicken for my son. My son likes it with Chapathi and specifically instructed to provide Chilli Chicken Gravy and not a dry one. I ordered from a nearby restaurant where I know they even ask whether gravy or dry when you order Chilli Chicken.  Anyway, I paid online and got the order in around 1 hour. When I opened the order I was surprised to find dry chilli chicken, From then I called the customer care multiple times to change the dish but their standard response was - ""It was restaurant's issue"". Knowing very well the restaurant, I can't believe it.  Then I escalated it and tried to talk to their manager. He had a weird explanation that as the item was in their ""Starter"" list so they provided dry item. And that they had informed the restaurant about my instruction and its the restaurant who missed that.  Now, if I am paying to Swiggy, whose responsibility is to deliver me what I ordered.  STAY AWAY FROM SWIGGY"
We got really bad experience about swiggy today. First of all they directly cancelled the order saying we were not reachable but when we really look out the issue the reason was unavailability of food. So can't you guys mentioned it earlier? And can't you guys message then? And we didn't even got message from you and directly you guys send your delivery boy with parcel. AND NO OFFENCE WITH DELIVERY BOY. Also we got the order of Chicken and we are really not even sure that it is actually a chicken or not. IT WAS REALLY A BAD BAD BAD EXPERIENCE.
Earlier I used to order subway via swiggy. But suddenly out of nowhere I am not able to order from same place stating swiggy doesnot order to this place.  I mean what the!  Earlier I used to order subway via swiggy. But suddenly out of nowhere I am not able to order from same place stating swiggy doesnot order to this place.  I mean what the!
"On 8/03/2018 I had my worst experience of my life.  I was hungry and I didn't eat my breakfast . I ordered with swiggy to the nearest hotel shown in app with just 20min of delivery. Its been 1 hr my order didnt come.I tried to chat but swiggy executives are just closing the chat. I called them thrice and the third time I got to know that the hotel was closed. After 1hr 20min. And they were telling me to book another order and will be delivering within 40 min. So to eat food Should I wait for 2hrs? And one of swiggy's executive was like we are giving you a compensation of 50rs so enjoy, WTF. We are not begging, plz don't treat us that way adn by the way for that order I have place 100rs coupon too so do you think for waiting 2hs 50 rs coupon is a very good compensation. Never ever I will order again from swiggy, remeber. I will recommend all my friends to not order as well. I run a youtube channel with more than 10k subscribers and I will ask all of them to not go for swiggy.  Good Bye"
"Bad delivery even the packaging was not that good. The delivery guy charged me 90 rs instead of 84. I didn't knew the bill amount as my brother ordered it. Upon asking the amount he said 90. He should have been more truthfull. Even above this he was asking for prize for fast delivery. I didn't had the change so I gave him 100 rs and then he asked "" 10 rupaye bhi dene padenge kya? ""  I suggest never order your food from swiggy  it was VERY SHAMEFUL what the delivery guy did. Just for 6 rupees he sold his dignity"
Swiggy worst experience.my order was shown delivered but it wasn’t and I paid through wallet .Don’t order through swiggy they are fraud . The delivery boy switched off his phone when tried to call . And he was like delivered. I will not order through swiggy and suggest not to
"I place an order for and the delivery guy cannot find my location.  Apparently, he called multiple times which I did not receive and he waited for an hour before he updates swingy to reach me,  when swiggy reaches they express the same emotion to which my response was that I did not receive any calls, Right after that the delivery boy calls addressing me as'BRO' and asks for directions which I help him with and come down to the main road to make sure he does not have any difficulty.  After telling him over 2 phone calls the direction, he kept saying we waited for an hour when the order was placed not an hour ago.  I reached out to another landmark recognized by the delivery boy and after calling him multiple times he says we were there and you were not so please cancel the order.  CONCLUSION: ""SWIGGY BECOME SHITTY "" you are only as good as your job well done, period. There is a huge gap in the market for cheap thrills delivery boys and a startup that cant hold up who need to be replaced periodically. For a delivery service, swiggy is not even doing as much as may be a DUNZO, who dont charge mark on food and just go by logistics.  SWIGGY - They send me a message saying "" your order # 1147661870 has been cancelled since you failed to respond to our delivery executive calls. Now I would nt have taken the trouble of writing this, but lossers send me this, like it was my fault to order with them, which it was, I am considering going bezerk on social media with them. There should be a platform to sue them. I did not have dinner.  Lesson to learn - DONT* WITH CUSTOMER."
"Hello team,  I never thought I would experience this from Swiggy.  I ordered a Mushroom briyani and landed up in ghee rice!  Taste was not edible.  Packing was good.  I could not eat even 2 spoons of mushroom briyani!  The briyani has no taste - no spice, so salt and did not look like a briyani.  Very unpleasant experience.  Damn hunger!  This restaurant is rated 4.3 but does not keep up to the mark!"
"I had ordered food from Fresh menu through Swiggy.  ""Food's worst."" from Fresh Menu.  My order was:    Paneer Tikka Wrap x 1    Garlic Bread Supreme x 1      Whom to blame. ""Fresh Menu"" or ""Swiggy"".  Don't recommend to others.  CAUTION: Food from ""Fresh menu"" is not good n eatable at night times."

"You get bad food or spilled food, you not only have to worry about the spillage but also now you need to click a photo first and only then can you share your complaints with the eminent Swiggy Support Team!  This is the second time this has happened to me!  First time, I ignored and then proceed further. This time, I have had it.  Very good support Swiggy! Well done! Good Job!  Keep spilling our food and keep asking for pics! Way to go!"

"Very bed packaging I m upload photo please seen this pic . hotel name also put up  Prince Ki Rasoi  410, Opposite Ramada Hotel, Sector 45, Gurgaon  Also confirm you Your delivery boy and I m call customer care but not solve my solution properly.  I have never imagined that food delivery app can be this bad. I'm not gonna use this website for food delivery ever in my life. Food never delivers on time, There are no restaurants in my locality in this app. Food quality is not good, in fact, nothing is good with this website or app"
"Worst experience with swiggy. I used to really like swiggy initially when they started the app. But now , there are so many reasons to hate them.  I'll be mentioning the few reasons    It has become very expensive suddenly. They increased the delivery charges way too much.    The delivery executive never has change and we always have to leave the change to them and when the same thing happens with us , that is just not acceptable.    There is some dish we order and there is some other weird dish that comes to us.    They dont deliver at a few places( even though the place is very much a part of the city) , I dont know what the reason is.    The delivery executives cancel off the orders at the last moment saying our address is too far even though we ordered from the same place before.( Maybe it is the delivery executive's laziness)"
"I've been ordering from swiggy specifically from restaurant named Hunger Strike since quite a sometime and this has happened twice as per the records and many times which I have ignored, with me that even after writing in the suggestion and instruction option about how I want my food to be, still instructions are not followed properly. And this time I got an insect in my food. Swiggy has refunded me my amount then and there only, but are not taking any specific action for my compensation.  Refunding money is not the only solution. I am a vegetarian person and for such kind of person seeing an insect in their plate will be against religion."
"I am using this app from last 3 months, I ordered chicken momos.  I really don't know why there delivery is so slow, I got it after 48 minutes.  I really hate their customer service, I called after 30 minutes of ordering with customer care executive he rudely talk with me and said delivery will be reach don't waste our time.  I really don't like the service and quality of swiggy, I use zomato nowadays it's really better than swiggy.  I will no recommend swiggy to anybody."
"Worst Company! Worst Service! Worst representative on call! . I ordered meal and everything confirmed in the end he said we can't deliver beyond 7.5 KM. Worst service!. In future I will take care to order not from this worst service company, where the representatives have there own set of rules. Then how previously delivered?"
"I ordered Aloo Parata from swiggy the resturant has given invoice of Rs. 58 and from swiggy charged me Rs.143. they are over charging then actual price and delivery is also not so good compare to other peer, worst expirience I had with any networking site."
"The Swiggy is a food ordering app which has changed the delivery experience in major cities. Before ordering food used to be a hasty affair, and in some cases it was only for known people with the restaurant. The app-based startup has a bunch of delivery guys who go to a restaurant and deliver the food to the customer at the convenience of his home. When Swiggy started it used to flout and pamper the customer cashback and heavy discount offers. When Swiggy started expanding its fleet and got a huge base of customers, they started showing their true colours. Swiggy started charging customers for every reason they could find; Delivery charge+ Surge Charge+ Rain charge+ Festival Fee and so on. For a long period, Swiggy extra charges added 4x than the food charges. In addition to this, Swiggy customer care often brushes often without accepting their fault. Swiggy often delays assigning delivery executive, customer care justifies saying that it will be assigned shortly, that goes on for ages. Whenever there is a delay in delivery, Swiggy customer care justifies it saying that estimated time was 70 minutes, it was delivered on time. First I don't understand that why there is 70 minutes time ETA for food delivery, second why don't accept that there was a delay in assigning delivery executive instead of justifying that there was no delay. Swiggy has become arrogant with no direct competition from any other player."
Please do not buy food from swiggy app. Company is cheating its customers by providing bad food if you raise complaint reply is we will intimate the restaurant they ask photos and theydont give money to restaurant for bad food but ultimately ur money is lost. Be careful and do not use any food delievery app. share it maximum.
"Why bother ordering something specifically, if they're just going to end up giving you what they feel like?  I ordered from Spice Factory on my swiggy app and it came well in time. But, it wasn't what I ordered. I can understand if there's one odd thing that was wrong but the entire order was wrong.  So I message a customer representative and she gave me a refund for one item and told me to send a photo of the order on chat and receive an entire refund. So I disconnected the call and started a chat. Then the man I spoke to did not help one bit. All he said was ""Sorry for the inconvenience"" and said he couldn't do anything about this! Then why bother even having a customer care?  First of all they send me the wrong order, make me pay for it and then waste my time on the stupid chat, which btw takes soooo long for them to answer!  I am extremely angry and dissatisfied with this and will stick to Zomato from now on."
Firstly they delivered wrong meal.then after discussing they again ordered a wrong meal.You order something you get something else.Tried reaching customer care also but to no avail.Worst experience.  I will never be recommending Swiggy to anyone.I used to be happy with their service before.Lost a regular customer.
Had ordered from swiggy couple of hours back and haven’t received my order yet. And their customer service ppl are the worst.evrytime I call they keep saying ten minutes . No value for customers time and money. Horrible service. Never recommended. Worst .
"It's a scam.i ordered food and made payment online. After 1 hour I received a call from customer support saying restaurant doesn't exist, they said they would refund the money, haven't received any refund so far.please be careful.Royally cheats in urban Era."
"Hi friends, today I have faced a issue swiggy food delievery app.they are running a offer of buy 1 get 1 till 14th feb.i get a msg about this offer so I checked in app and found offer is runing.but for confirmation I asked swiggy about this offer on tweet.then they replied order 1 item and you get 2nd with it.so I ordered 2 pizza with offered restaurant that they are showing on their app under this offer.but at the time of delievery I found there is no item as per offer.so again I tweet for it.then they said offer is no more.i tell them I asked you about it before order and with in 5 minute offer is gone, when you are showing offer is till 14th feb.but after this they are not replying, still waiting for their reply.clearly they make me fool.so my suggestion is not to use it.and if you want to try then use on your risk.  Very poor response I get with them"
"Never order pizza from swiggy, we ordered pizza from swiggy and the location pick is 1 km away. Still they took 1 hr 20 mins and pizza delivered is cold. You can try other foods but definitely not pizza. We can't eat cold pizzas. I can't blame pizzahut as they prepared the moment order recieved. Pizza pick up was very late."
Swiggy has the best and fast food delivery service in India. I recently order three thali combos form a restaurant via Swiggy by applying a discounted coupon. They call me for the confirmation of the order. After that I got my order in 15-30 min before by the given period of time and my food is so hot and tasty.  Swiggy gives the best and quick customer service as compare to the other food delivery service and also they take care of your food from damage. They deliver food from most of the restaurants which is near or quite far from your residence by taking so minimum delivery charges. You can track and get updates of your delivery agent from via mobile app or website through navigation.  Their customer executives behavior is good and polite to their customers. Swiggy gives best offers and discount coupons for their customer. There is no minimum order value for any customer. You can order as much you want.  Overall it is a best investment for order the food from home and get it As Soon As Possible.
"Swiggy mobile app.  swiggy mobile app one of the best apps of ordering the food.it connects us to nearest restaurants, hotels.the best part of this app is that on the dashboard of this app it asks for our mood to eat Italian, french, Chinese, Punjabi, north Indian, etc, . so it makes our mood even better to have a food and shows the track record of delivery after ordering a food it shows to what limit the order has been reached whether it has been dispatched or not if dispatched then the where the delivery by the exact location of the delivery boy it shows us on the map so this app is best one."
Swiggy is the one of the best online restaurant.Food delivery system is awesome and on time .food is very delicious like KFC and MCd. I would like to say swiggy mobile app and swiggy food is too good .swiggy served food in good to order and much yummy to enjoy food swiggy online restaurant .keep swiggy. According to other online restaurant swiggy is ultimate no 1 all other restaurants.  Best 3 benifit of swiggy is -  Recommended mobile app  Vide range of online restaurant  Live tracking of food delivery  It late but not too much it happened only some occasion.
BEWARE OF DELIVERY BOYS FROM SWIGGY . THEY STOLEN THINGS FROM HOUSES WHEN COME FOR DELIVERY. AND COMPANY ALSO DON'T TAKE ANY ACTION WHEN YOU DO COMPLAIN(MEANS INDIRECTLY SUPPORTING THEM) . DON'T RECOMMEND TO GO WITH THIS COMPANY SERVICE. FOR THIS KIND OF SERIOUS MATTER ALSO THEY TAKE VERY LIGHTLY.
Just now I received food from swagath grand habsiguda through swiggy .It's not like swagath biryani it's taste like local 70 rupees biryani .My suggestion is don't book food in swiggy .It's really really very bad IT'S A FRAUD .Now I got experiance I never book food in swiggy .Swiggy blames swagath grand
Now a days started to charge excess other than food. For packing alone charging additional 40 distance fee 20. Everyone knows KFC doesn't charge for packing still they get. Very few restaurant charge for packing minimum. But they charge for every restaurant I think these are all the hidden charges taken by swiggy not the restaurant. Also food most of the time don't get what we order. For buying 100 rs food charging 100 extra. I think it's time to quit swiggy. There s no zero star to give
"3 days back I had requested some sustenance from Swiggy.com amid night hours. According to the guarantee, the request was satisfied in reasonable time and I was content with the conveyance exertion.  The issue began when I found that the eatery has stuffed the wrong nourishment inside my bundle. I requested Schezwan Noodles x 2 amount yet had gotten Veg. Noodles. I don't know that this miskate was made at whose end.  I basically raised a help ticket and the sustenance was returned as it seemed to be. The real issue began with the discount. They guaranteed me a discount inside 4-5 working days yet for quite a while, my discount was not by any means created. I continued griping to the client mind however they were not troubled by any means.  They addressed my messages late lastly when I debilitated them by the name of court, they started my discount soon.  I am despondent with their client support thus I don't prescribe swiggy.com to arrange sustenance on the web.  I am not requmended to anyone."
Very slow service. In short trying to scam others in by giving fake offers. Delivery done in minimum 1 hour 5 mins instead of 30 mins. I ordered food from KFC by 11: 00am and got delivered 12: 45 pm. And it was written on swiggy that I will get 20% off on late delivery. They did not gave me anything. They said you already got discount by adding coupon code. You won't get any more discount then that.
"On 23/01/2018 I ordered naan and butter panner masala through swiggy. They confirmed my order and payment was confirmed. After 30 mins I got my order. When I opened my food the naan was fully dry and over cooked, which was not able to eat. When I contacted the delma hotel, they didnt respond well. They are answering just casually."
I have ordered on Swiggy for restaurant name Fiftey Fiftey Chicken corner. Restaurant sent breads in diaper wrapping material. It's really disgusting to know this and in future I will not use swiggy.  Swiggy should take care such issues as it may spoil image of Swiggy.
The most horrible service . I ordered something from your site seeing lightning fast delivery. liars. I waited for the estimated time of delivery. after that I called to you people. Call was attended by Rankesh and told me that nobody is available to deliver the food. He is arranging someone that too after 50 mins of order placed. Again after an hour called you people. Again Aleem picked the call and committed to deliver the food within 5 mins. I didn't receive the order for more 15 mins. Again I called and Kamaljeet picked the call. This guy directly told me that we cannot deliver the order as the restaurant has been closed and have to cancel the order. Moreover The most rude guy I have ever talked with. He is offering me Rs100 coupon to use. Bloody pathetic . Am I calling you for Rs100 coupon. I needed food.  These people commit false. I need to take medicine and ordered someting to eat before that. But this company advertise false delivery.  Order No- 1134978403
"A few days back I had ordered some food from Swiggy.com during evening hours. As per the promise, the order was fulfilled in fair time and I was happy with the delivery effort.  The problem started when I found that the restaurant has packed the wrong food inside my parcel. I ordered Schezwan Noodles x 2 quantity but had received Veg. Noodles instead. I am not sure that this miskate was made at whose end.  I simply raised a support ticket and the food was returned as it was. The major problem started with the refund. They assured me a refund within 4-5 working days but for a long time, my refund was not even generated. I kept complaining to the customer care but they were not bothered at all.  They answered my emails very late and finally when I threatened them by the name of court, they initiated my refund soon.  I am unhappy with their customer support and so, I do not recommend swiggy.com to order food online."
"Pathetic experience with this uttejit pathetic service. sometimes they do not get change inspite of telling them.  Today, we ordered an ice cream and for 2 and half hours it didn't get delivered. Highly unprofessional. Let's curb this place.  Strict action should be taken for this. And we demand compensation. This is mere filling your customers."
"Hi,  please find the below details of my order:  Order #: 1133866064  Delivered by  Rushikesh Rajendra Gaikwad  I have placed the order Vaggie Salad, it should contain lettuce but instead o lettuce they provided Cabbage, I mean what kind of service you are providing, I wish I will never ever place order with you guys. this is a fraud case. I am so hunger at this moment that's why I am finishing it now. but it is kind of fraud that you guys are doing.  I will never place order with this site again."
"Swiggy is the worst app to deliver the food. I am trying to register as partner since last 2 months and every time the pop up comes that there representative will get in touch. Again I tried after 2 months and on their registration page they say that my mobile number is invalid. If my number would be invalid the how I am receiving the calls on my number which is registered and linked with all the government documents. I think people made a hype about Swiggy, we should boycott this app and stop giving them business."
"I am uploading pic of my order, you will understand the reason for finding time to write this review. They are just unprofessional without any commitment. when they say, your order is confirmed, means you are gone. your order will never delivered and you will start fighting with your hungry after 1 hour and won't have choice to book another one or cook by it own. I placed order at 10.15 pm and till this time there is no clue where is the order. So stupid guys . sucks."
"Hello friends! I am sharing my personal opinion on Swiggy.com.  There are many online websites available through which we can order many food items. One day I ordered food from Swiggy.com, when I try to order for burger I sae that the burger is not available at that time. Then I decide I order for pizza and it tooks very long time to delivers your food. Sometimes you don't get what you have ordered. Between your choice of restaurant and your residence food will get mixed up and you end up getting a fake food while you pay a premium restaurant prices. This is my personal experience couple of days before."
"Hai friends today iam going to share and review on swiggy.    In swiggy application cost was very high on all items.    I ordered one veg puff and one samosa for these I paid Rs.30. But if we buy in bakery shop the actual cost for veg puff and samosa was Rs.10.    We have to update the pin to pin address in swiggy application orelse need to tell clear address to that particular agent.    Day before yesterday I ate chicken biryani in parry's corner, chennai. Its quantity was half kg cost was Rs.100. But I checked in swiggy application same chicken biryani cost mentioned as Rs.130.    It was too high for every order they collecting like this. They are cheating the people.    Using this application people's getting lazy and simply sitting at home and ordering the food.    In my concern it was not good very disappointed and dont order the food in this application.    Like this we are paying excess amount for every order. Due to this they are getting more benefit.    I never seen and heard this kind of cheating application and scambled the people. Like this swiggy in many states, in many areas how much they will get. For vehicle petrol charges also collecting for us in a order. My recommend do not order in this application.      Thanks."
"Hi guys, Last week l have ordered food from swiggy.com website. The timing of the order was Jan-4th 9 pm.Till 10: 30 pm l didn't gey any response or any confirmations so l contacted to customer support ( Rabi) who first said l have chosen a restaurant away from my locations, for which my argument was l have ordered food in past as well. Then he asked for another 2min to cheak and the just disconnected the call.Than at around 11pm l called again the customer care for which the support asked me to wait for next 15 min as we are already working on the order and someone from swiggy.com will call me in next me 15min but nobody called me.I tried call in again multiple times but always waiting more than 5/10 mins.Afterwards next days they sent me sms, a refund email, without even bothering to call me once.  So, l will not recommend this website. Thank you"
"One of the best food delivery app out there. Since I have been using this app, I haven't got any problems. Moreover, I also got an refund of 20% for just 5 mins late delivery. I think this is the best aap to get food anytime of the day. I am looking forward to getting more discounts and more customer satisfaction options."
You don’t get what you have ordered.  Between your choice of restaurant and your residence food will get mixed up and you end up getting a fake food while you pay a premium restaurant prices. This is my personal experiences couple of days before.  Their chat zone is a just gimmick and they never answer your question.  Stay Away.
Todays I am sharing my experience. About swiggy app and service.  When wish to talk to a costmer care executive they put us hold for around half and hour their delivery exuctives are rude. I got a call from a delivery exuctives once telling me that he will refuse to pick up my order at it is far and he will not even call the company to Tel them that! For non swiggi assured oredred the order get late by half and hour sometimes! The order status in the app get updates late! Delivery exuctives close the order 10-15 minutes before they have actually submitted the order to show that they have submitted the order on time! On questioning them they speak rudely and retord back telling us that we should be thank full that we have at least received the order! Please all these points thank you. Sometimes after.  ( Reply from swiggi) : on 7/1/18 hey Kiran we are very disappointed to know that faced this issue while ordering with us: ( please email us more detailes from registered email id at swiggisocial@swiggi.in so that we may look into this and neccosories action to avoid such itsences in the future) .  So thank you this is my experience .
It was an emergency and after ordering food nd whn delivery boy assigned I called him and conveyed my mgs . But truly he did the needful. He collected the food nd arrived witin20 mins. Mr. Madhukar need to be appreciated. Nd order number is 1129291668 .
Swiggy is a portal in which we can order foods for our hunger.  Swiggy portal is good but many items are not available in this portal.  Many occasions I got wild on seeing this website since I would be thinking to order something to ear but that particular may not be available in the portal.  The app is user friendly and it doesn't take much time to load too but it is not fulfilling our expectations.  Information are not provided in depth.  It takes its own time to deliver though it has got many persons on the wheel to deliver.  I have decided not to go in for this app anymore.
"Ordered my food at 1:10 pm, get a call from swiggy that there will be a delay of 10 mins.2:10 get a message that your order has been delivered, customer rep says I can see your order reaching you in 5 mins, call at 2:20, so sorry mam, am just reordering the same dish! Wait for another 45 mins!  Thank you swiggy for such a fantastic experiencepls read sarcasm"
They don'tknowhow to talk to therecustomersworstsiteto order. I orderedcake for someone'sbirthdayand they didn't deliveredit on time plus they triedcovering up there mistakes and the order got cancelled.  Use foodpanda there are many other apps
Hello friends! I am sharing my personal views about swiggy.com . There are many online websites available through which we can order many food items. One day I am felling very hungry and decide that I order food from swiggy.com when I try to order for pizza I saw that pizza is not available at that time. Then I decide I order for burger and it tooks very long time to deliver your food items. It is not user friendly. sometimes food items of your choice are not available and sometimes it delivery very late. Contents are also not updated at this site and I decide that I will not order any food for this site.
Hello friends! I am sharing my opinion on Swiggy.com . we can see that there so many website available for food items in which one is Swiggy.com. This is not good website because I have ordered many times from this site. they does not provide good services to us. sometimes they cancel the order and sometimes they delay for order. They does not any discount on anytime. And the food they deliver are also not of very good quality. so that now I does not this site for order the food.
"Guys, please don't use Swiggy anymore. it's the worst app for ordering food. If you have wait for 3 hours then you can go ahead it's your call. No matter how much you try to talk to customer care you won't get any solution out of it as they don't have the authority. also if you have an urge to listen ""Sorry"" then please call the customer care.  Thanks."
"Ttransaction failed, but amount got deducted. Cust. Care told they will refund. It's been nearly 10 days, amount not yet refunded. Wrote email twice, got same response that amount wud be refunded. Bledies, if don't refund I'm gonna talk with my lawyer friend. Stay away from this useless"
"Why don’t you show “the food is no longer available” it happened to me twice, whenever I order the food agent calls me and says its not available. It is so irritating coz your refund do not come on time. Its been more than 10 days that I haven’t got my money back. So pathetic. And on top of that there is no any number for submitting complaints."
For the first time I used swiggy to order some food. The order was unsuccessful and I got an sms saying amount will be credited within 2 working days. Since the order was unsuccessful I again tried to order from a different restaurant. Worst part is I got a call from both the restaurant saying your order is confirmed and on the way. I told the person saying it got canceled and both the people updated as it’s delivered. Highly unprofessional.
Hereafter I wont use swiggy. Customer care not responding back. Orders made veryyyyyyyyyyy Late. I order ice cream from kulfi house at 1.45 pm now it is nearly 2.37 pm. Order not picked up till now. Customer care not answering till now.  Worst service  not even 1 star rating is eligible for swiggy
"I had a bitter experience with SWIGGY, I made an order by 08:04 PM, I have mistakenly made an order with a restaurant which I had a bad experience. So, wish to cancel my order so, tried to call the customer care by 08:08 and I waited for like 5 minutes over the call and just hearing music, so I dropped off and started to chat with them on the cancellation, people were not so helpful they said food were already prepared by the restaurant im wondering how could an order could have been prepared in 10 minutes, if I had to cancel the cancellation charges will be the full amount of my ordered food and also when the customer service people called me on this issue, they said like the full amount of cancellation charges is for the mistake I have done, how ridiculous"
I had a very bad experience with swiggy. They won't care for what you receive. The customer care is even worst they won't pick our calls and make us waiting as a result we will loose our talk time. Very worst. I suggest not to go for this app or website .
Swiggy I personal didnt like service because depend on area to area they provide the service and quality is not so good or great what they say. Now days they are alot of compitation and I dont understand where they are different from other and im not getting any kind of justification. Intially everyone is good and great and in while they loose their capacity to maintain stability. I felt swiggy need to across more offer and treat every area where they deliver on same platform. Swiggy needs to improve their service menu offer and many more.
"First order the restaurant didn't have an item, not Swiggy's fault. I said just leave it and take it off the order. when the food does arrive the driver tries to charge me for the missing item and then the customer support( 10 minutes at the door trying to sort it out) ask me to pay for it and wait for them to fix the issue. Told the driver no and left it at that. Despite the support telling me to wait with the driver until they solved the issue and telling me to wait to get my money back for their mistake.  Later on my girlfriend orders and issue with restaurant again, we change what they didn't have in stock and waited for our food. The driver rings cause he can't use google maps so we have to guide him to the house, once again cause google maps is so hard to use apparently. Then the driver arrives ringing the door bell at 11 o clock cause he doesn't have the sense to call the phone and wakes up two people in the house. No apology from him and he gives me attitude for being annoyed about it. When I open the food we find out that the driver messed up the order entirely. A half hour on chat with Swiggy support and no help, just them repeating what I am saying back to me. Swiggy is the worst delivery service you will ever encounter."
"Worsst Service.degrading day by day.they blame it all on technical glitch.but will keep u hungry for hours without any regret.I dont see they are gonna survive.  Worst Service.After 90 minutes, they say Delivery boy has not been assigned, however food was prepared an hour back.and the best part is that u should get the same cold food prepared an hour back by Delivery boy in 30 minutes from now.never gonna order again from it Order #: 1123349252  And its been 2 hours and Delivery Boy is yet to pick y order."
Hello to all the viewers of Mouthshut. I guess everybody loves to order food online. I too am a foody and I order food online almost thrice a Week.  Hence I would like to write few lines about Swiggy application. I have got this application downloaded from the Appstore and I have been ordering via it from past more than a year and so I am posting the key points:  > Delivery executives are quick and I am quiet happy as they have delivered most of the order on time. Sometimes some orders get delayed due to unexpected reasons.  > The best part I like about swiggy is that they give an immediate call if the delivery can not be done due to some issues with the restaurant.  > More option with great offers and coupon codes.  > The user interface of the application is quiet simple and is easy to surf through the menu and place the order.  Now some of the points that I would like to point out that they should change or have a look.  > We should be able to order from multiple restaurants at one go.  > Some times they send too many sms and email alerts when there is any change in the order. A simple notification in the app itself would help most.  Rest all is fine and I love using this app.
I waited for my food for one and a half hours! when the waiting time was 45 minutes. After which when the delivery executive came and delivered to an unknown source which he claims to be me. I had already paid for the order. How can an organisation be so irresponsible to deliver an order without confirming the identity.
"I had ordered a Rasmalai Cake from Cake Zone through Swiggy. After 30 minutes I got a call from the delivery guy who was there in the restaurant and he asked me to talk to the restauarant guy. I was told that the cake that I ordered was not there and hence they could send me a red velvet if I was okay. Since I had already paid the money, I had no choice and I asked them to send a red velvet. They assured that they would contact swiggy and get the remaining amount refunded.  Next morning, when I started following up, after around 30 minutes of chat time, swiggy gave me a refund amount of 74? When I tried asking them the calculations, they started talking baseless things like I cancelled the order, I flipped the order, I ordered for eggless. If I had ordered for regular Rasmalai cake, why would I order red velvet eggless.  Even if it was eggless, the amount was not what they were saying. Simple basic mathematics - and it took me 2 hours to make them understand . Finally they agreed to pay it back.  On the other hand the restaurant manager was not even ready to talk. He just kept repeating that I needed to check with Swiggy.  Serive and support - Poor because the phone number does not seem to be working.  Information Depth - Very Poor because they can not even do simple subtraction before responding  Content - Bad  User Friendly - Poor because chat closes too soon if you dont respond for a minute and then you need to start all over with a new person  Poor Service - Stay away."
"I'm a very regular user of both food panda and swiggy services. I've noticed the prices in swiggy are high compared with food panda. Biryani from a restaurant is 120 in Food panda and it is 150 in swiggy. I've many changes in prices. Like foodpanda swiggy doesn't have any facility to place a pickup order. The reason why I place a pickup order is, the restaurant takes more care of online orders than offline orders. so I do place a pickup order and directly visit the restaurant to take my food. that is not available in swiggy. Delivery charges are also high in swiggy which is 35/- and 25/- food panda. Swiggy is also weak in giving offers to the customers like food panda. The only positive I had noticed with swiggy is its late night service. We can order food even after 11 pm with extra charge for late night delivery which is a very good facility."
We ordered some soups from swagath east court .the delivery executive did not do the right packing as a result of which the soups fell in the packet and were completely unfit to consume on top of thus the app does not even have phone no:s of their delivery executives.a very bad experience
"Had raised an order from the Swiggy mobile app on Sunday. After making the payment of Rs.786, Swiggy sent me a message saying the order is not serviceable. Didn't know what it meant, probably that they didn't have enough people on the ground.  Tried in many ways to reach Swiggy:    When I called the Swiggy helpline, they insist on first entering my registered mobile number. When I enter that, they disconnect the call saying that I don't have any active order with them. Not sure why Swiggy won't talk to you if you don't have an active order with them.    When I try to chat with them after locating an old order and selecting a category, the chat window takes forever to open and then refuses to open - both on the app and on the laptop.    Swiggy doesn't have any email address listed either on their'Help or Support' section where I can leave a note offline.      Question is,  How do I get my money back?  Thought that Swiggy was a very user-friendly app, but after the above experience, I am not really sure. Doubtful whether I will encourage anybody to order from Swiggy, given my above experience."
"I have never imagined that food delivery app can be this bad. I'm not gonna use this website for food delivery ever in my life. Food never delivers on time, There are no restaurants in my locality in this app. Food quality is not good, in fact, nothing is good with this website or app. swiggy said no minimum orders, but there is nothing to order. I'm very disappointed with siggy's services.  I do not recommend anyone to use this website or app for food delivery."
"Yesterday I ordered a pizza and pasta from a aakhri pastathrough swiggy, I thought that I will recieve food soon as well as hot and fresh but the thing was different. The pizza toppings were totally destroyed sticking to the top of the box in which the pizza was kept. I was not able to enjoy the pizza the way I want it, instead I have the eat the topping separately and bread separately. The experience was horrible. I don't know why they are charging for the packing when they are not able to pack and deliver it properly. The pasta was ok. They need to improve on the packing department and deliver the food as soon as possible"
"Hi everyone  This app very good regularly I will use this app because, in my home regularly we will use this app when wr are busy with other workd if we order the food in online near by any restaurant it will brings the food in adap.  In thos app id I order less than 200rs they will charge 20 rupees otherwise they will not charge single rupee  Delivery service are very good  But only one disadvantage is they are not accepting sodoexo coupons  Especially there layout and features are excellent"
"Last night I placed an order on swiggy of French fries from McDonald's. It said that order will get delivered in 23 mins, how ever it took an hour for the delivery agent to come. By then the French fries got cold and very soggy. I couldn't eat cold oily food like that because it causes acidity. So I chatted with swiggy and asked then to refund my money for the fries and all they kept doing was giving me automated replies regarding not being able to refund the money. I don't think I should pay for something that I did not consume. And they said that it's not swiggy's fault. If the delivery agent is getting it late then it is swiggy's fault. I have given lakhs of business to swiggy, check my order history and you'd know and I regret giving so much business to you all. If this issue isn't resolved then I'll leave swiggy on a very bad note and I'll give my business to your competitors and my chat was being handled but some stupid agent called Suraj Kumar Sharma. Get this resolved asap."
Worst app for ordering food order was delivered after 2 hours. I ordered food from swiggy and after 1.5 hours they are calling me and saying some items are missing and it would take more time and the delivery boy was arrogant  Bad experience  Arrogant staff will not order from swiggy again in my life.
"When ever I order food from swiggy I get food very cold. as well as I had asked them to change the packaging of the food as it smells very badly.(I know swiggy doesnt pack the same but had requested them to ask the restaurant to change the same) or else remove them from your Order list. I will suggest swiggy to add more and quality food restaurant, as currently there are very less restaurants available in my area in swiggy."
"Kindly Note: This feedback is abt how Swiggy interviews people.  Hello all,  I went to swiggy which is located close by to silk board. I am writing this to inform that they rejected me without any reason and wanted to share the same(in case if someone has faced - kindly share the same).  I applied for chat process and there was close to 3-4 rounds and they rejected me after final round.  The final round was taken by a girl where she had lot of attitude as if she owns the company. She asked me few basic questions like - how soon can u join, are u fine with shifts and so on and after 10 mins - they just said that I am rejected and whn I spoke to HR - they don’t have any reason for rejection. These guys hav lot of attitude and they don’t interview properly nor will give the feedback if your rejected.  I am very disappointed with the way they did to me. Hopefully wil get justice for the same!"
"Yesterday we ordered dinner from Sagar Ratna through swiggy. The food was bad. Papad was smelling.  But when have visited the same restaurant at Dwarka sector - 6, New Delhi a couple of times. It was quite tasty.  What I feel is if we order through swiggy, it is quite different and they pack separate food for delivery kept for these types of orders. Even the quantity of each time was visibly less compared to having the dinner at the restaurant.  Anyways quite a bad experience."
"Pathetic customer service specially floor manager, don’t know how to talk, how to resolve issue, mr Karan, he appointed as floor manager and not able to resolve issue, just say sorry by eod and ask customer to be hungry for one day, unprofessional team."
"When I ordered my first food online on swiggy and they me a 100rs coupon for free.  I happy very happy with service and support that they provide while getting the order. the delivery called me for confirmation of order and asking me that whether I want extra spoons and boxes. which I felt very happy for that.  the app provides easy navigation for you see, were the delivery boy is currently and how much time it takes for the delivery of the item. I got food items before 15 minutes from expected time and loved that.  one day I got the wrong item on swiggy order and I called support team, even I am speaking rudely also they were polite to me. and for the wrong item, they have given me a full refund and free food. and got my money in one day."
Yesterday I ordered my first food on swiggy.Cupon for first time was initially applied.But when I linked my account with paytm wallet it debited full amount and no coupon was applied and I was charged double the actuall cost.They take long time to delivery.i received food aftr 2hrs of placing order.And the worst part is the food was stale. The customer support service is pathetic. Was not able to contact them.I tried for 3 continious days it just said could not connect.Hopless service.
"This is to inform you all about the best app to deliver the food in perfect time , i.e., Swiggy Mobile App.  Now a days its a really a fantastic app indeed to peoples who are all in metro cities and those who are not having time to cook at home due to some personal or official work.  In this modern trend situation , the most of the peoples are using online booking for all items especially for food. Some of the apps are not delivering the proper food at proper time.  So this is the only app doing all these things which others are not done.  For an example , I am telling about my true incidents to you all that right now I am in overseas and from their I am ordering the particular food from the specfic desired hotel to my family members.  It has been delivered on time with hot and also I can track the delivery boy from here itself through online .  Its amazing and superb thing to those people who dont have sufficient time to cook but want to eat desired food.  So now I am keep ordering my food through Swiggy app only with discounts & offers in price.  So guys enjoy with your own desired food."
"Staying away from home, the biggest task is to get food which is not very expensive and delivers on time, and swiggy has always been a reliable service for me . I have been using the SWIGGY application in my phone for past 2 months and so far the experience has been good.  The service and support is great, with real time tracking feature which they provide by which I can track my food .In case of any late delivery they also offer cashback. The customer executives are helpful and cooperative.  Swiggy is available in app as well as on website and personally what I like the most about them is the wide coverage of restaurants they have. I can customize my order, give any special instruction if I want and pay either on delivery or online.  What I dont like about them is the non availability of cash on delivery option on coupon payment which can be sometimes a pain if I dont have my card around.  The app is user friendly, easy to use, and takes least time to load . So far I have not incurred any problems with the service and the delivery personnel are also cooperative.  I would definitely suggest the service."
"I Ordered several times from this website and I received very poor quality of food everytime however once I ordered from Subway Food, they did not deliver even after one hour and forty minutes. they did not inform even then I cancelled the order. I would suggest people instead of letting yourself hungry for a longer time or getting pissed of please order some where else instead of this app.  Shashwat Sharma"
SWIGGY - we felt it was a boon now it has stooped to the level of extortion. they- used to be deliver the food at a Extra delivery cost of Rs.40/- later they enhanced it to Rs.50/- now It is Rs. 90/- Cafe bahar is within 1 /2 km range chicken 65 costs 120/- and the delivery charges are+ 90/- awesome extortion. NEVER RELY ON SWIGGY. UNLESS U ARE DESPERATE. NO ETHICS APART FROM THAT THEY ADD SURGE Many of the restaurants have free delivery service irrespective of what your billing amount is. even one single dish is delivered. DONT RELY AND FALL INTO PREY . MOST OF THE RESTAURANT OWNERS SAY THAT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DELIVERY SYSTEM PEOPLE DONT KNOW ABOUT THAT. THEY SIMPLY RELY ON ONLINE DELIVERY SITES/ APPS.  MOST OF THE RESTAURANTS HAVE HOME DELIVERY WITHIN SOME RANGE. CHECK IT. LETS NOT MAKE THESE GUYS EXTORT US.  THINK BEFORE RATING
"I ordered food from a restaurant named Maddyes kitchen, Kurla West.And the food was disgusting.Maddyes kitchen's previous reviews are also all negative.I request maddyes kitchen, Kurla West Mumbai to be removed from swiggy to avoid future disappointments."
"Well, I had a plenty of experiences with this store. I have been Hyderabad for 4 years. I have ordered food in Swiggy a lot of time. Each and every time I have faced an ample of problems in terms of service, customer services, delivery time.  The Swiggy has not that good services to the customers and services they have provided not bad but not that much bar. When used to customer services support over there. I had faced such stupid sentences from customer executives. Very recently, I ordered the pizza and biryani for me and my friends too. I have ordered at 7:28 pm. The expected delivery time is 8:00 to 8:10. But that person will take 8:42 pm. This leads so much too angry. I was controlled my self. Between of this time I have contacted to customer service, What about my order, They have not given appropriate information to me. The services, which are not good.  Information about the store is okay, The website created with the depth and the designed very well.  Content, It's really nice every day they updated the product, I mean cuisine is too good. ANd they gave well-detailed information too.  Obviously, which is a user-friendly website, we can easily order over there. There are no much of ambiguities as well.  Not that much of time will not take to load the website and order. You can expect with the low internet services also it's well opened."
"In last couple of days SWIGGY is really working on hype. I put up in west delhi and in the veening times what I could see around was swiggy delivery people. I was obsessed with the idea of shifting from zomato to swiggy to give it a try.  Therefore on day we were chillin at friend's place and felt like having something so I ordered from swiggy. I must say I was really impressed with the delivery as it came before reaching time. Though I ordered a lot of food so one and two things were in little bad condition in a bag. As for talking about the app its easy to use, user friendly, doesn't take much time to load. the only drawback with the application is connectivity with the restraunts, they are very limited."
I had ordered first time in swiggy food. but food is totally cold and not cooked proper so I send mail for complain but no one is call back me and no one helpful for me please no one people is ordered in swiggy is is very besd service provided and very bad food provided
"Hi Friends, just a small feedback on Swiggy. Last weekend, I had ordered food in Swiggy app at 12.30 pm. The order was 2 biryani from Thalappakatti Restaurant.  I just waited for 2 hrs till 2.30 pm but I didn't receive my order. The order was supposed to be delivered within 25 minutes from the order placed.  I asked the customer care about this and they replied like they will check and revert back on this order. Again I waited for 20 more minutes but I didn't get any call back from them. I connected the delivery executive whose details were shared with me through the app even he had no clue on my order.  At last out of frustration I had no other option than cancelling my order. I asked for the refund which they said that the amount will credit in my Swiggy account within 5-8 working days.  The service is very poor and very pathetic. Customer service is utter waste. Not responding in a proper manner. Till now there has been no call from them and I am damn sure they will never credit the amount in Swiggy account too.  Don't opt for Swiggy anymore. Instead try the new app called ubereats."
"Hi friends This is Mohammed Khaled Ahmed from Hyderabad India.  Today I am going to review about a famous online food delivery website which call them self the hunger saviours, swiggy.com  I am a frequent shopper from swiggy.com from my office in my lunch time.  Most of the times I order one hour before my lunch break.so dt they can send my food by the time I take lunch break.  Unfortunately I had to wait for whole lunch break time with out eating any thing as I did order online and delivery boy did not deliver food on time.  So I had to call them again and again to ask them to please bring my food quick before my lunch break finishes.  But many times I pay money for food but could not eat it because my lunch hours are finished.  So over all I am not happy with swiggy.com.  So would not recommend this food delivery website to any body."
Swiggy has no customer care support. I have called them up for some order change& paybacks but nobody picks up the call n if incase it gets picked then they put you on mute. Delivery guys are on time but back support is way too worst .! I will delete swiggy app right now.
"My husband and I have been frequent and loyal customers of swiggy. But recently, their behaviour has made us vow to never order via swiggy. Past 2 orders have been delivered late with the food going all cold. My last order was half cooked and of course cold. When you tell them that the order was delivered late, they twist the terms and conditions according to their own convenience. I don't know what they are charging extra delivery fees if that work itself they are not doing properly. That's not the end of story, when I contacted their customer service, they literally tried to dodge from taking any responsibility. Finally I convinced them to give me a refund which they credited to my swiggy money. Next day their senior executive calls me and apologizes for the neglect. But that very day I see that the refund money has again been removed from my account. Guys, even their higher management is fraud. Do not trust them. Following this, swiggy even removed the ""call customer care"" option from my account. They left me highly frustrated. Ordering from zomato is much much better. Atleast their customer care is cooperative and their service is worth it. Atleast you don't have to wait forever before you receive your food. I would really really discourage anyone from using this shitty and rude delivery service. They are plain cheaters."
"Swiggy is basically an app through which you can order food online from your nearest favourite restraunts and thge food is delivered within an hour  The concpet of this app is crisp and clear and is understood very easily.I am sure the person who came up with this idea was lazy and foodie.it is a unique concept and really beneficial at a very reasonable rateLAYOUT The app is designed in such a way that it would attract many customers. The whole app logo is in the same colour and the logo is basically the alphabet S written in a stylish form and below the logo is the term or the app nameSWIGGY, below that the two words say food delivery.The tagline is good food great life. Easy to operate- the app works easily and smoothly its easy to order you just have to choose the restraunt you would like to order food from, then choose the food of your choice from that particular restraunts menu add the food you like and ot goes to the cart after addying all the food you can then check the whole descriptive bill. The app also charges for delivery but notably its reasonable. Filters are available- while ordering the food you can see the food of your choice through enabling filters for example I can enable the pure veg filter if I want to order vegetarian food. Amazing perks during festive seasons-the most lovable thing about the app is that there are several offers available during festive seasons.As you use the app frequently the delivery charges decrease and you also get coupons which encourage you eat more and more"
"Swiggy is online food delivery APP but it is nothing new in that there are quite a few other and better options than swigy, the food comes cold, the minimum order value is not there but offers are available only for high rated stuffs, it had done too much of advertisement for itself but not considered its quality of service, one of the things about it that I feel bad is its punctuality, the delivery guy never comes on time . it may be useful for many but not for me I seriously hate the app."
Requested for an order placed by mistake to be cancelled. As it was only single click and I wanted to view total cost including taxes and delivery charge screen which was not updated on preview page I clicked by mistake and order got placed. Inspite of requesting cancellation within two minutes of order getting placed they wouldn't without a cancellation fee of RS. 75. That pretty steep when I informed within two minutes literally to cancel the customer care simply delayed and than said that package is on the way already. So either pay for the food or pay cancellation fee so they make money both ways .
"I had ordered an food from swiggy last week around 8 0 clock in the evening but I waited till 10pm I haven't get food I called customer care they keep on saying food is on the way, I called 5 times same story from the swiggy support team and after sometime order is cancelled I really fed up what kind of service they are giving in the night 10:30 pm if you suddenly cancel my order where should I go this is really very worst service I seen from the swiggy team and also money will be refunded back after 5 days. I never order food from swiggy."
"The delivery boys carry boxes as given by the restaurants near the footrest of their scooters, with contents visible many a times.  They are not provided with delivery bags.  Happened both times I ordered.  Gave ridiculous replies when questioned.  Its food we eat give and they ought to give it some respect.  Their chat and phone support are manned by ignorant people.  Enough of them and thanks."
"We ordered for 3 Mutton biriyanis from a restaurant Junior Kuppanna through swiggy app and what they delivered was pathetic quantity of meat, but when we refused to accept their unfair quantity, what came as a surprise was swiggy admitting that they cannot guarantee Q& Q, but they refused to support their customer from unfair trade practice by their suppliers for which they charge us. Highly unexpected from Swiggy"
"I tried ordering Pizzas from Dominos through Swiggy on 5th July, 2020. The experience was absolutely awful courtesy SWIGGY and DOMINOS  Despite ordering Pizzas at 9.22 PM and delivery expected by 9.52 PM(30 Mins), there was no signs of delivery for several hours. When we felt that no delivery would happen, post a couple of hours of ordering, we had no option but to start cooking close to midnight.  I had given up hope but long past midnight after many hours post ordering, a delivery was finally effected.(Check attachment) By that time, food was cut, cooked, eaten and we had gone to bed.  When we tried to eat those pizzas in the morning, they were not the dominos pizzas we always have but were not up to the mark in taste and the base was so rubbery that most of it was not edible.  Swiggy was absolutely uncooperative and refused to take any responsibility  a) They could only be reached by Chat and they offered no resolution whatsoever  b) Refused to contact Dominos on their own when Dominos were not reachable in any way post terrible delays  c) Finally gave us a contact number for Dominos which didn’t work  d) Kept me on their chat for an hour plus without a hint of a resolution but rather added to my harassment  e) Kept claiming that they were not responsible for poor service, delivery issues, or anything else  f) Refused to cancel the order post it was delayed at their end for more than 2-3 hours  g) Tried to threaten us with Legalities and policies but on counter questioning changed the topic and started giving lame answers  h) As per their records, eventually delivered pizzas which was delayed by several hours post the timeline  i) Absolutely no accountability, no professionalism, no sense of customer feeling, complete indifference and refusal to take any responsibility for major mistakes.  Dominos were  a) Not reachable through their Toll Free No when incessant delays happened  b) Vasant Kunj Store Number Not reachable for hours  c) As per their records, delivered pizzas which was delayed by several hours post the timeline.  d) Terrible food eventually delivered - Extremely Rubbery, Improper Taste and Majorly Inedible – That too after so much delays  e) Absolutely no accountability, no professionalism, no sense of customer feeling and refusal to take any responsibility for major mistakes.  I would like to know how DOMINOS and SWIGGY would like to compensate us for this harassment and terrible experience. I would warn everyone to use their judgment on both these brands…  SWIGGY – Most unreliable brand with 0 Accountability – Better to spend a little more and order directly than to completely lose peace of mind…  DOMINOS – Have been a loyal customer . After this experience, something has gone drastically wrong with them…Both in the sense of quality and logistics  Supratik Datta"
"Poor and worst service ever from Swiggy.i booked the food on 20 Oct from Biryani zone marathalli and in tracking system- it was updated as delivered after 30 min.after lot of follow up with swiggy team, food was delivered at my place after 2 hours.Delivery Boy Harisha N was on call with me and he was giving lot of excuses.initially on call, he told to that food was delivered on time to right customer then he told that the order was cancelled then traffic then security was not allowing him in apartment.Delivery Boy and Swiggy customer care were talking in Local language to make sure I will not inderstand.food was no longer to eat once it reached my place.my mood was totally spoiled and have put that food in front of street dogs .  Lesson I have learned is not to order food from Swiggy and not to recommend anyone to trust on Swiggy."

WHY SIR, THE FOOD INSPECTORS, OF MCG, DON'T GIVE NOTICE AND PENALISE, BIKANERVALA, JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH AND WELL CONNECTED, SO LET THE CITIZENS FALL SICK AND HAVE STALE FOOD? 1. I AM COMPELLED TO MAKE A WRITTEN COMPLAINT TO YOU, AFTER SEVERAL, REPEATED BAD ORDERS AND BAD BEHAVIOUR OF PACKING BOYS, BAD AND INCOMPLETE ORDERS, BAD QUALITY OF FOOD ITEMS BIKANERVALA, SECTOR 54, GURUGRAM.    I had brought it to the notice of the outlet manager, PRADEEP SANGWAN about horrible quality of several food items? The persistent bad quality orders, have caused acute health and mental problems to many citizens.    Yesterday, vide order Invoice No. 06/17181014 / 2055 dated 14-10-17 at 21.06.19, we had ordered ONION RAWA MASALA DOSA& MOONG DAL HALWA. As mentioned already above, that the RAWA DOSA, was badly made, badly packed and the sambar was hot water with big fried red chillies, put on GATTA/BOARD, WITHOUT GREEN BASE NAPKIN, packed badly in an open pizza box? Shocking to look at! The moong dal halwa, was two spoons only, with half of dibbi floating with ghee? The weight was of ghee only! All this has caused food poisoning!    Prior to this, two days ago, I had ordered two Rajkachori, but the packaging had fomented curd? I had made a complaint to the outlet on phone! 4. Prior to this, I had ordered VEG MOMOS, which were packed badly, without red chilli sauce, and momos were smelling bad! Complaint was made to the outlet!    Prior to this I had asked for Kaju biscuits, and got Kaju barfi? Complaint was made and the order was changed, after much arguments by one Kishore, and manager! It's disgusting!    Prior to this, an order of Veg. Seekh kebab, roomali roti, paneer tikka, in which roomali roti never came!

VARIOUS COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE POOR QUALITY CONTROL OF THE FOOD PRODUCTS BY VARIOUS PEOPLE, but no action is taken against these politically well connected fast food restaurant? Because of which many people get food poisoning and loss of health.    These are expensive, but popular food joints. The deteriorating quality control of food is not checked by the concerned officials of FOOD CONTROL DEPARTMENT. HOPE YOU WOULD INTERVENE AND INVESTIGATE THE COMPLICITY OF THE CONCERNED DELINQUENT OFFICIALS AS TO HOW SUCH NEGLIGENCE, ON INNOCENT CITIZENS IS BEING ALLOWED? CITIZENS ARE SUFFERING AND CHEATED BY BIKANERVALA? THE HEALTH OF CITIZENS IS OF IMORTANCE."
"Hello all, iam here to write my review on swiggy customer care centre located in bangalore near silk board.  Iam not taking about the company nor the delivery I would like to share my experince on job search on swiggy office near silk board, bangalore.  Since its indian based company and like the concept of the swiggy I thought would like to join swiggy team. When I had been for interview I have observed around 15 people on que for the interview. The worst part is thier is no proper place for those who come for an interview. I was advied to have seated on enternce door near elevator and stair case. Their is only one room available for the interview sad part onlt one HR for entire bangalore swiggy customer care centre.  I dont understand swiggy really want to give prefernce to the employees. I dont want to talk about the HR he was really super fast in taking interview. But no proper place, room, facility for the interviewer.  HR took me for first round of interview, the HR advised me to take writing test also no proper arrangement or room to take written test they advised wherever you get empty go sit and write written test on floor where in swiggy employees already working.  Then I waited almost 2hours fro. Then one HR took newcomers first round then he went back to correct written test and came back in hurry and said you can leave for the day as does not meet the requirement. I really want to know what exactly swiggy want from the interviewer.  If I ask question to swiggy team, having interset in working with you is not enoufh.? Yes I agree I am not studies well high end english medium, but I did have desired to learn and work effectively. With a minimum training can pickup very fast.  Swiggy team you need to understand iam not talking here facility yoy provide to the interview, I want to convey that your swiggy customer care located near silk board interview style need to be changed, selecting people who are studied with great english medium they will leave you one or the other day insteed select some one who intrested to work with and serve your customer as our customer.  Swiggy I really intrested to join your team, due to faciltu you provided to the employees is not upto the mark. You are not giving prefernce to some one who is intrested to join and work for you.  No more intested to join you, because if you take interview on hurry that means yoy not giving enoufh time to the one who come for interview. Firstufol we will be nervous for few seconds and you ending within few seconds does this really what swiggy team does?  Not happy swiggy team, I dont know where to write suggestions I found mouthshut is best place to reach correct swiggy representatives."
We often bring food from outside and order from online service and I planned to try swiggy's food and ordered some south meals they took 1 hour to deliver food which is very irritating .  The best thing is we get every type of food in their website and can get home deliveries.  I contacted their customer for late delivery and they apologized for that for which I felt happy using their service.  their website is user friendly and can be used with little knowledge of internet.  It takes more time to load the website which also irritates us. That was the last time I used their service.
"I am using this application from last two months .this applications provides you all the restaurant which are nearby you , but there is huge deflection in restaurant price and swiggy prices . You can track your order . But the most bitter thing is that if you got bad food , you can not get refund back . the coustmer support service is very poor ."
"I was under assumption till now that swiggy charges only for delivery(Rs.35) apart from actual ordered price. But this is not the case.  Yesterday, I ordered few items from South Grand Hotel, uttarahalli, Bangalore. My Bill has come to Rs.196+ Rs. 35(Delivery)= Rs. 231. But I took similar items myself as ""Take away"" 2 days back from same restaurant. That point, I was charged around Rs. 160 by restaurant. There is a huge difference in item prices shown on Swiggy compared to prices at restaurant.  When I spoke to swiggy customer care, they said that there will be slight difference in prices compared to actual price. I don't see any reason for this as I am actually paying Rs. 35 extra as delivery charges. I believe Swiggy should not be charging more for ordered items. I was charged roughly 22% more apart from delivery charges.  Atleast, Swiggy should mention upfront that price of items will be more than actual price when we try to order from Swiggy.  Ordered date: Oct. 10, 2017  Order#1111411640"

Hello guys. Swiggy mobile app is very much helpful for me whenever my mom is not home. It is my all time food ordering app.  App is build with so much user friendly features. There are lots of category to choose from. You can first set your location and look at menus of hotels nearby you. After ordering they update you with different notification like order is confirmed. Order is out for delivery. They also give you delivery boy details so you can contact him.  Its order tracking feature is also very helpfull it gives you exact minutes by when your order will be deliver. Really very good work swiggy.!
"I've been using this app quite well for a long time. But, my recent experience with the app pushed me to uninstall it instantly. One order took almost an hour time for me. The GPS locator is real worst that it wasn't able to locate me nor I was able to enter my address manually. I immediately uninstalled the app at the peak of my patience."
"Due to some condition I have to ordered some food last night through swiggy.They made a bill about 400 . I order some food from my nearest resturent .swiggy promised to reached to my address in 30 min . I thought they just estimate , they can't reach . But no they reached my home in 25 mins . Then I thought the food must be bad quality . No I am wrong again . Quality of food was good . U am satisfied with swiggy . Now a days swiggy served with speed . They are really good"
"Did not deliver an order from KFC on time, the restraunt is hardly 20min from my house and the site advertised for 30min delivery .  Very disappointed and am looking for more cases like this, need to take proper action against them for misleading consumers like this."
"I saw reviews here telling swiggy is delivering late but in my city it is in lightening speed.I am from Dumdum, Kolkata maximum resturents give delivery within 30 minutes.There are lot of resturents to choose.Their Customer support also reliable.I always have used their chat service on the web version and my problems were always solved.  As for their website, It is quite simple and very satisfactory to look.Web page load is very fast.There you will also get to use e-wallets as for your payment option.There cancellation and refund policy is easy to handle.  In Dumdum, I would say it is the fastest food delivering company."
"Very unprofessional. Gentleman on the other side of the phone blamed on delivery guy. I wondered why they even took the order when they had no control on whether the delivery boy would agree to deliver. The order was amounted Rs. 1145/- on Hyatt Regency Pune, For refund its another pain in the neck, The telephone guy confirmed within 24 hours. The chat guy's version was 5-7 days. No commitment, no professionalism, simply bogus. Stay away"
Usually I used to order from an restaurant through phone call.I just cross verified the rate of food in swiggy.its double the cost.  Sometimes the delivery is very slow than expected.  Once I ordered biriyani for 172 rs.including gst and package charges with delivery charges.the total cost is around 310rs.which is almost twice than the food rate.swiggy can review these aspects and provide an affordable service.
"No Restaurant cannot provide you food like home, due to the reason of study or job in another city or country you have to adjust for your daily meal, eating outside in restaurants or hotels. Swiggy also promises to provide you fresh and hot food at your doorstep.  You can easily choose your food from various restaurants/hotels nearby your area, I ordered from Swiggy a few months before butter chicken and butter naan, I got confirmation to delivered the same within half an hour, but I did not receive it as committed time, after many follow-ups and calling service center, the problem was resolved but its take 1.45 hours.  Service Center try to provide adequate information to their customers but sometimes they are unable to do it.  The App is User-Friendly and easy to use but sometimes it is very annoying and makes you irritate.  You can easily upload your request in website and app, but due to service pattern, I never recommend to use it."
I recently used swiggy app to order food online.  I ordered food from art of spices in paschim vihar. I order 2 double chicken roll and one butter chicken.  So at the time of placing the order it showed that they will be taking 25 minutes to deliver.  So I waited for 30 minutes but I didnt received my order.  I called them so they told me it is on the way you will be receiving it in 5-10 minutes.  But I received my order after an hour but the time they told me was 25 minutes.  When I asked the person why are you so late when you promise lightening fast deliveries.  So he said sir traffic jam tha. And art of spices is just 15 minutes from my home(meera bagh).  Not at all happy with their service.
I have ordered it and the customer care also confirmed it will be delivered . After 11. 30 waited for so long he told me he cannot deliver the order . Talk to customer care when I called customer care I was not connecting ivr was going on ang at 12 swiggy custcare called and refuned the amount I have 2 sleep hungry the whole night. If it is not confired why you guys promised . Guys never order it from here it can ditch you any time.
"The worst delivery service I have come across in India. Delivery personnel is unprofessional and untrained. Probably never heard what a good customer service is. This is really frustrating for a customer to wait for your order for 40 minutes, knowing that the restaurant is 10 minutes away from your house, and then get a call from from the executive informing you that they don't deliver to your area."
Firstly I would say the concept is awesome and when you are new in the city and don't know about places then how to decide what are the best nearest restaurant for your hunger and then swiggy comes to place. Just type your area in their site and you will get a bunch of restaurants from what you can decide what is best for you. The last sunday was awesome and the credit goes to this app as because of it I got good food.
"SWIGGY is total nightmare.  Today, I placed an order for sweets(#1107906714) at~2:30. I waited for the delivery boy to come to my location till 3:30(it takes around 10 minutes only from Om sweets to my location) and then called him up.  He said “I am waiting at your gate for so long but unable to connect to you”. I reached at the gate but he was nowhere. When I connected to him again he said I am coming in 5 minutes. I waited for another half an hour standing at gate and during this time I called him 2-3 times and he kept saying I am coming in 5 minutes. After half an hour he said your order has got cancelled and I am already on the way back to my office.  I called the DM(Mr. Rony Sehrawat) he also misbehaved saying that this is not the right channel to raise your complaint. You can raise your complaint wherever you want to but not here.  Also their customer care number and live chatting link is not working.  It is fine that I’ll get the amount refund back to my account but this sort of services are not expected from a professional organization."
"I had order some food for guest and no person at the house to pick up the food. At that swiggy helps me & hot food diliver just before time. Really helpfull thanks swiggy for helping me your dilivery timing his really good & restero connected to you, your app is good and food is also very delecious.amazing food good service keep it up."
This is a horrible app. I expected delivery to be on time. First they give delayed times for delivery and then the order is not delivered within that time. I had no other optn but to order again. I am not suggesting this to anyone. Also last time the qty was horribly less. I hope things get better
I have had many bitter experiences with swiggy. First and foremost thing is that the app takes a lot of time to load. Once the app loads we select the desired food from the desired restaurant and fill the cart. At times when we proceed further to order we get to see that all delivery boys in that area are busy and that we will have to wait for some time or order from some other restaurant. This is very annoying because you will have to wait for long at times before the delivery boys become free and you get a chance to order. By this time your hunger dies and many a times we have even changed our plans deciding not to order anymore.  Once we were very hungry one fine evening and had ordered sandwitches and a choco lava cake. We received the parcel and paid the amount to the delivery boy. Once he left we opened the pack and found that the choco lava cake was missing even though we had paid for it. We had to call the customer care center and complaint them about this. After our complaining the delivery boy came back to us with the cake apologizing. He said that he was in a hurry so forgot to deliver the cake.  Another day we had ordered dinner and were constantly waiting for it to be delivered. When the delivery was not taking place after a long time we decided to track it via the Swiggy app. To our astonishment we saw the status in the app as delivered. We were really shocked. Again we had to call the customer care center of swiggy and complaint about the same. This time we had to call multiple times until the issue resolved. Finally the delivery boy arrived telling that its the apps fault and it has mistakingly updated as delivered. Whoever maybe the defaulter we became totally exhausted and our hunger had died almost.  The good thing which I had felt about swiggy is that they deliver food even if its raining heavily. They do have extra charges for this but still we do not have to get drenched in the rain or starve.
"Hi guys today I want to share my own experience on swiggy.com.  I always use to order food online and 3-4 days ago I ordered from swiggy.com as they are giving 5% off on food delivery.  So I ordered it from there as it was my first ever order from swiggy.com.  I ordered some snacks. Burgers and some chips and 1 pizza at 8: 30 pm and they said they will deliver the food in maximum 30 minutes But I got the food after so many complaints after 1: 30 hours laters from order.  This was really a very bad experience from swiggy.com  I always use to order from foodpanda but because they are giving me 5% discount on online payment but now I dont want the 5% discount from swiggy.com  I will now order from foodpanda app , they gave the food within 30minutes.  Thanks."
Today I ordered using Swiggy - House of Dabbas(Order #: 1106709692). The Food Quality Aweful.  Sent CHICKEN to a VEG MEAL.  Improper Packing.  THE BEST PART - SWIGGY TEAM NOT BOTHERED ABOUT ANYTHING.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. AWEFUL TEAM. NO CONVERN. NO EMPATHY.  The team keeps repeating. We are Sorry will Take care next time.  When called all they bothered was that - We will refund.  Religious Belief - Shattered coz of Swiggy.
Most of the resturants listed with them provide food below standards.  It had happened many times that food I have ordered is below standard and unhygenic.  Even their customer support service is poor.  They do not take any responsibility for the quality of food.  I had made complaints regarding quality of food to swiggy but no actions have been taken.
"Hi friends  Today I want to share my experience about swiggy.com which is used to order food.  I did not like to order  food from here after the bad experience.  Main problem about their service is the low quality food.  Pictures placed on the site was mouth watering.But entirely different from actually provided.  Content provided in this site is not enough because it does not help the customer.  It is user friendly but not customer friendly!  Moreover when I ordered two chicken piece, they delivered only one piece.  I called them but they simply told me that they delivered my order to other person  by mistake!  Responsible seller never give such a reply.  Delivery of the food is not fast.It makes lots of problems to us.  Another problem was with their customer service.They never reply for my calls and always told me to call after sometimes!  So it is better to avoid this site for ordering food if you are really hungry!  Thank you"
"We ordered briyani around 8 pm, from Salem RR briyani and we received a call for order confirmation by 8.30. Since then the delivery person is searching for our address. When I asked him, whether he has Google map, he said no. For about 1 hour is was roaming around in our neighborhood streets and during his last but one call, he even used bad words. Then finally after 1.30 mins, he found our place and made the delivery . But the food was not from the shop we order, they have collected from some random briyani shop . In spite of paying so much, we had a very bad dinner and being abused by these delivery people."
"I am actually a daily customer to visit swiggy in my android.! I always get best food.within 30min.it shows up all the near by restaurants for me.within which I can pick up my choice.! Nothing much to complain.because most of the times I had good experience! My favourite restaurants I always pickup is Nandini( for best andhra meals), Nanda Gokula( good south and north meals), Anna kuteera( for best break fast), and Roving feast for best pasta ever.!  But few times I faced issue with location tracking in swiggy app.I always give correct location of mine.but somehow.location gets changed.and I have called the delivery executive to come up to my actual location where he charged me Rs.100 extra for travelling from there to my location which is hardly 5min bike ride!  I would definitely recommend to use this site to get tasty food.!"
"Just now we had a pathetic experience with swiggy. And this is not the first time. We ordered from a restaurant[Order # 1104404808] and after getting a message that order has been confirmed by restaurant and assigning the delivery executive we got a call after 50 mins that order has been cancelled.  We had a doubt on swiggy as this is not the forst time this has happened and I called the restaurat directly and found that because of NON payment from swiggy that restaurant is not taking any order through Swiggy.Moreover swiggy never returns your money but gives swiggy money which means if you like it or not you money is stucked with swiggy only.  This is just a horrible service. Few days back I just read a blog about how swiggy is cheating all restaurants, customers etc and today I could relate to it. I am regular customer and places order with swiggy almos everyday, but nomore.SHAME"
"I was looking to place an order for some pullareddy sweets. I browsed through swiggy website for nearby good Sweetshops. The price on the website are not reliable. I have selected the items by noting down their prices, At the checkout point the prices of the items are increasing. I contacted the shop by phone and confirmed that the prices have too much difference. Note that these prices are after so called discount.  So I can conclude that the service and suppor is bad.  Information on the website is Good.  Content of the items are good enough  User friendly website.  Afterall they are charging heavy money, so one star rating"
I Know About This Site From Internet And Then One Day I Decided To Order Food From This Site For Party Because They Provide 20% Discount On Ice And Spice Restaurant Which is Near To My Place It Takes 10 Min to Go In that Hotel.  Then I Open Website And Search That Hotel.The Website is Very User Friendly And Show All The Menu With Discounted Price.Then I Order 3 Chicken Biryani And 2 Chicken Tandoori Which is Cost 1140 They Provide Discount 20% And Price is 912 Which is Good Thing Which I Like Then I Paid That amount Through My Debit Card.They Show Me Delivery Time is 34 Min But I Wait For 1.10 Hours For My Order And Then My Order Will Come Then I open My order All Food is Too cool and Due To That Reason Food Become Tasteless My Party Plan is Flop Then I Call them But They Not Respond My Call.  I Am Not Recommended This Site Due To Bad Service and Late Delivery.
When I have requested chicken burger from Swiggy.com site. It was demonstrating the cost of the chicken burger was 200 INR and they are giving 5o percent rebate in requesting 2 pieces. I have requested the dinner however it was deferred for 1hour in their conveyance times. When I got the bill I have discovered I was charged 400 INR for 2 pieces. I have disclosed to them that I was having 50 percent rebate offers for the dinner yet he has rejected as the offers was legitimate in earlier days. Since I was ravenous I have paid for the dinner. I had awful experience so I prescribes everybody to choose other site for requesting nourishment dinner.
Me and my friends ordered burgers from this site expecting too be good as shown in the picture . Firstly they delivered two hours late from the actual time . Second thing happened when we opened the packet all the burgers were cold and smelled like an dirty animal . They all look like they have served us the burgers that were made one two days ago . Dirty smell was coming from them . We get too much disappointed because all the money we used was wasted and we have to remain hungry because we had no money left now . When we called them to complain they didn't listen and said this can't happen and cut the call. There are also not much variety for the food as there are not different types of food we were expecting.
My brother food ordered from swiggy displaying images is different and they serve is different and they delivery boy came late after 30 minites and they food is not fresh and was cool.  I complaint about this they send me another curry and this time also they order me wrong dish and then we eat the curry was amazing but was cool. And they do not provide extra.  Iam recommend food panda and any other online food's website.  My brother pay 500 note they dont have any change my brother really feddup.
"Hello every one I think there is no need of introduction for such a big brand called Swiggy, love the way they do their service and supporting staff is help full especially when ever we request in the additional box for curd or extra spicy we get it always.  They always keep their information about their product and services in deep example they way they locate with GPS and they keep foods products in different sections like for Rice, biryani, fried rice etc and for chapati separate section with single, full, half different rates available with break up.  I like the overall content of Swiggy.com services and I love their content and the best part is its user friendly any one can use app or website without any hesitation its simple and effective.  Time to load is very minimum always work fine no matter whether it is weekend or normal days its good no issues with website or app.  Try it you might end up loving their services so much."
Horrible service . order cancelled after 1.5 hrs. called the cce but they lied. miss sunanda gave us unnecessary excuses. I am from a corporate and I ordered lunch for my friends I dont recomend it to any of my friends. am going to delete the app with immidiate effect. all their commitments are fake.
Firstly I installed the app at 11 o clock night am hungry I just heard the name swiggy somewhere so I go to play store and installed the app the review was also good and then I order from my near location daimond plaza kfc .in within 20min the delivery boy is in my door step am just surprised the fast and the delivey charges is free if you order more then 400 orr something so after that am liked swiggy food delivery time all thing is good most important trusted one .fully satisfied to customers and get nyc ratings and many more things.thats it.
Swiggy has one of the worst customer service.  I placed an order at 11:30 pm and at the time of placing an order the delivery charge was as usual.  Immediately after the order got placed the charged rose upto twice of their standard charge.  Besides as a result their customer service representatives are worst too providing false promise and never living upto customer service.  #StopSwiggy#WorstCustomerService#Fraud
"Swiggy app is a mobile app used to order food from restaurants which are within the radius of permissible kilometres.I am referring the same for the Mumbai location.The process1) Select restaurant from where you wish to order2) Swiggy will tell you whether they can deliver or not and at times levy a distance fee or INR 50 ( subjectively) 3) Check the restaurant menu card add items from the menu card and apply coupon if you have one ( generally for first time users) . Swiggy isnt generous ; ) 4) Proceed for payment either Wallet or netbanking or credit card ( check for autosave and remove the tick for safety purposes) 5) Select the address you have declared at the start. They have categories like Other, Home and Work6) The person who is going to get your food arrives at the location and you are notified on the app about this.7) Food gets delivered at the stipulated time and is hot for hyperbole ( piping hot) 8) If there is an issue with the food , Swiggy has a live chat and you can notify them about the issue.They swing into action fast and resolve the issue.Courteous people and even the delivery people are also well behaved.Your location should be on at all times.You get to track the entire process of pickup to delivery like you do for OLA vide a mapRefunds are not so easily had like Zomato.Swiggy refunds are called Swiggy moneyHighly recommended!"
"I have been using Swiggy for over a year now. and I believe it is a good app. I have used this for different meal services and am pretty happy about the app. I rate this better than zomato(customer service sucks) and foodpanda.  Pros:    Simple, easy to use    Good choice of restaurants    Quick and efficient delivery      Cons:  I kinda dislike the delivery charge that they put up. as a customer, I would like a program where a frequent user gets a lower charge than say occasional users."
Swiggy is very best service and restaurants. order food online from over 8000 restaurants experience fastest food delivery service with no minimum order & GPS tracking slurping down these garlic fried noodles make life all the more spicy dishes in lunch banglore based company which offers food ordering and delivery service online is one of the most popular.

"We have a concern regarding an order placed on 8th August at 4.32 PM.  Order number:1101516982  Person delivered: RAJ Mohamed A(HE DIN HAVE COUTESTY TO RESPOND TO US)  # We din receive any bill from him, We ordered 3 Non veg burger and 2 Veg burger but received only 3 Non veg and 1 Veg burger.  # Pack was open.  # We tried reaching him but he dint respond properly.  Kindly suggest on the same.  we dont find any contact number in website.how to contact u people please suggest.its quite disgusting.  Did not expect such a worst service in SWIGGY."
"My first, (and probably the last) time on swiggy was horrible. My order was cancelled and when I ordered from some other place, I received both the orders and the payments for both orders was deducted from my paytm wallet. Never using swiggu again. Zomato is much better."
"I am a regular customer of Zeeshan but will surely not from today, what the HELL every after 15 days they are increasing the rate of their items they are more fast in increasing the rates than Airtel 4G and really why the Hell they are charging GST when they were not charging Service TAX .  It simply means that they were TAX Chor .  Really Sucks .  Suggest all not to visit Zeeshan as they are looting."
Swiggy is an online food delivery app that enables users to order food from restaurants with no minimum order and live tracking system.  This app is a live saver for many living in metro cities who prefer to eat in than to commute to dine. It lets you enjoy the meal at home.  There is option for online payment through mobile wallets anlong with debit card and net banking system. This feature intruiged me the most.  The app is user friendly. The discounts offered on the app make it hard not to order from these guys.  The cons are sometimes the orders get mixed up and the food is not servable. One particular case I remember while was that the restaurant served burnt food( paper dosa) . Though I wouldn't blame swiggy for this however I expect their delivery person to inspect the order before picking it up for delivery.  They don't deliver to all locations either. So deducting two stars for that.  Their customer support team is very helpful. And the description of the food items on their menu is quite detailed. Overall a pleasant experience. Hope they expand to more locations.
Food I ordered from swiggy displaying in image is different and they serve us different! and the delivery boy came late after 40 minutes and the food is not fresh and was cool!

"Hello everyone, As we already know that, swiggy.com is popular in food ordering. It is an Indian platform, where we can order food in reasonable rates. There everything is good, but there service is not good as I expected. They don't support on a call. Another bad thing is that, there food quality is depend on there mood. Most of the times, I have receive the different food. And most of times there is no taste in there food. They are work less. I have orders the spicy food, they sent me non-spicy food. I was not expected. I also complaint to them, but they are not ready to accept there mistake. Apps and website is good, they are easy to use, and it works fast. It is user friendly. It does not take time to get load, there delivery is fast. But some things are really bad, like changes in tastes and food. It is not even good now. I don't recommended this to anyone."
Hi  I was trying to place an order but due to some internet issues it was canceled and then Swiggy transferred the amount to my Swwiggy money. When I tried to place an order with my Swiggy money but it did not allow me because my order value was below my Swiggy money. So my concern here is that what kind f policy is this. The order value depends on the requirement. I m not happy with this and Swiggy is going to loose their customers.
"Hello everyone,  Swiggy is a very new and familiar company which deals with your food quality and delivery timeliness. I never used Swiggy before this month and I was really impressed with there Service and App interface.  I have ordered two times from them in the past and I am also attaching the invoice photos with this review.  Concept - The whole concept is good, getting your food from nearby restaurant and then delivering that food at your doorstep by just charging a small amount of Rs. 25. I liked there concept, and also wishing to order more from there app.  Layout and Design - App's layout and design was very good and user-friendly, I mean not for a single second I feel like I was lost or on a wrong track.  Features/Functions - They just deliver your food to your doorstep, that the only feature they have. If you're looking fro something else than this app is not meant fro you.  Usefulness - I last ordered from them yesterday, just because there was no one at home and I was hungry. Even I was also amazed with there Delivery timeliness, it just took 20-25 for them to delivering my food at my home. So yeah, it's definitely a useful app for foodies.  Overall a nice startup, would like to appreciate there concept and everything else. Thumbs up for Swiggy!"

If you eat in restaurant they have different quality and Taste. and from swiggy completely opposite.  I spoke with chat service executive they want me to wait for concern Team. Why should I wait for concern Team.  I am very disappointed."

I have been using this app from the month of march as we get late during year ending and implementing GST. I Prefer swiggy for ordering food as its user interface is really good simple looking dashboard and easy to operate.  Another thing which I like about swiggy is swiggy assured. Swiggy assured gives you the best restaurant details in the near by area. And less delivery time.  Swiggy takes 40 - 50 min to deliver food to the destination. When I order during night the delivery  time get decreases.  When you are in hurry use swiggy app to order your food on the go.
Simple and efficient way to order food for me would be swiggy. Recently it has grown a lot with more than 60 restaurants to choose in my locality. Been a loyal user for almost a year now and never had any real issues.  Delivery guys are also experience now and able to track locations even without giving a call to the customers. Atleast we don't need to break our phones explaining the route to the delivery guys like before.
I have experienced Swiggy is giving a paper bill showing the right amount of GST 12% added but the app bill amount is more and hence they are charging an amount which is not reflected in the bill. I have uploaded the Swiggy app bill amount is 228 whereas the paper bill amount is 211. The difference in the amount though not much but it is definitely a malpractice they are doing.  The 2nd time I made the order Cash on Delivery and they refused to give me a Bill. And I was contacted by Swiggy+914030911109 to confirm whether I would like to cancel the Order. I said No but I need the Bill for the food to which Swiggy replied that they would be unable to provide me with a Bill and hence has to Cancel the order. On top of that they charged me Rs 75/- for the Cancellation!. This is bloody loot!
First of all I'm a regular with swiggy.com  Ok I was trying to order a plate of fried momo's and the price was rs 80.00 on checking out the bill total went up to rs 172.00. Outrageous charge pls see the image uploaded. Breakup for the delivery charges are appalling.
It's been a consistent effort by team swiggy in delivering a pathetic service as usual keep up your efforts and with your hard work I'm sure you guys would be kicked out of business the way you guys were accepted by us.  Nelanti kranti bose.  Multiple times victimised by swiggy.
"Worst serviceI have never seen before.There r so many issues.1.Delivery executive took one and half hour time to deliver the food and while asked, he said multiple deliveries for an executive at a time.2.While doing so, the food was completely spoiled.3.  There s a huge difference between total amount of the bill and amount to be paid. please please don't go for it."
Swiggy.! This is the worst delivery app beacuse. I have ordered once and I got delivery after 2 hours and they say it Will be in 30 min. Why I cant understand tgey say all lies and cheat people. I say to not install this worse app. To get cheated and to waste time it's best app. So people U go and buy the products But never order in swiggy  Because swiggy means worst and worst mean swiggy. I kindly inform to the sufferers who are cheated by this app to spread tge news that it is the worst app ever. Please dnt install this please.
Very much satisfy with the ordered food by this app. The intresting part of this app you can track the delivery boy location and the delivery time by calling the mobile number of delivery boy. Quick food between any time in mid night also.  Carrying food with safety no clash of packaging. Im from delhi am satisfy with the delivery time despite the  other app like food panda.  Thanks
Swiggy.com had got famous in short period especially in Mumbai suburbs area where people are more fond of ordering tasty food from websites directly to their house aur any party event thus this website was launched in Mumbai with many outlets and people started ordering foods from the site and even at the initial stage the response was very good from the outlets of  Swiggy but gradually people started complaining about this website service because first of all the website was having lots of bugs they made some changes to the website front interface thus this lead to the bugs and error while ordering food from the website the coupon code we had were not implementing while placing the order in website this was very irritating as it would help to reduce or have discounts in the final amount.  Also the main reason for the flop of this website was the poor and incomplete service even I had one incident where I ordered Thai Chicken with green curry it comes with the portion of rice thus they didn't delivered rice with thai chicken and was frustrate and called the service agent for such carelessness thus he was very rude and weird didn't answered my question thus from very next day I stopped ordering foods from Swiggy this are the problems faced by the customers while ordering food from Swiggy.com.  Thus I would highly recommend to order foods from Foodpanda.in. But still the quality of food in Swiggy is very good they should improvise their business skill in communication and do less negligence in work.
We ordered 25 thali for our team working on Saturday for quarter close work in office from A2B. The order was placed at 12.30pm. We started follow up from 1.20. Finally we had to cancel the order at 2.20pm. Luckily we had some food and could eat and survive before we ordered some ice cream from a store directly. They were giving lame excuses like this is a bulk order and they don't have a container to hold this much food(25 lunch).  I'll get my amount back in my credit card only in next 5-7 days.  Think before you chose to order again with this site.
"Worst Service. I ordered food from Adigas, Bangalore which is approximately 2 kms from my the place where I stay. The devilry boy was assigned with in 10 minutes and as per the map from their website, he is 1 km away from Adigas. He traveled half a kilometer towards Adigas and struck there for around 1.5 hours.  Not sure why. When I called the delivery boy he indicated that he is reaching the hotel. I got the food after another 30 minutes. total 2 hours approximately. Stay away from this service."
"Absolutely appalling service. Ordered a pint of ice cream and an hour and a half had passed. The delivery guy was nowhere to be seen. I had to cancel that order since the ice cream would have melted. They cancelled my order and made a replacement order and said it should be there in 35 minutes. One hour and 20 minutes later, still no order. This is just absolutely appalling service from a supposed business. Ridiculous customer service as well."
"When it comes to order food online why a person will order it online because he need it badly means to say he or she do not have time to cook or want to save time.Same thing happened with me, I ordered fast food online throught the app which usaually take time of 10-15 minutes to order and still the items are not available on to the restaurants & when you are hungry you order anything which is available so do i.  The time of delivery took one and half hour and the still I need to microwave the snacks and you have to tell them every location 2-3 times even though you have put the location.I will never try to order food from swiggy."
"Utterly useless service, app and support - Ordered food from Swiggy, took 15 minutes to confirm and the rider been there and he calls me and say ""they don't have the item order something else"" . To escalate this the website is not having live chat rather than FAQ's and email to support - RIDICULOUS.  The mobile app won't allow to place another order till the time you review the past order and the maps are utterly scrapy - they show a whole different location"
I had a good experince with swiggy. I ordered food and received before time. There best part is it doesn't have any minimum order policy as compared to other food order app.Only they found difficult to find the eaxct location of my address other than that food was awsome but they ask for extra charges called packing charges.Overall serivce found was nice.
I recently started using Swiggy and I must say that real time tracking is the best thing Android/IOS app.  I never have to guide persons for route to reach my residence.  They always come on time till now and give me a call after reaching my residence.  Another thing I liked the most is that you can search for dishes in search bar and the app displays list of restaurants which prepares the dish which I desire for.  The only thing which I want Swiggy to develop is to prepare a estimation timer to get our delivery.  Overall till now I had nice experience with Swiggy and hoping to get same service in future!
"I am from Hyderabad . Every time I order food online it will be Swiggy . Delivery guy""s talks very politely and delivery very fast compared to other food delivery""s . I ordered through food panda once, as track order is not there and delivery guy asked me to come to certain place wors responsce from them . That was my last order with food panda. good customer care support . on time delivery recommended to others"
"As we all know swiggy well for the food delivery. I am also impressed with their services at the earlier stages, but now I came to know their performance. It is really hard to get the food on time when your are feeling hungry.  I had such horrible experience twice with swiggy. At first time I was ordered after checking with the delivery time as 40min, but it was not reached on time and when I try to reach the guy I got a reply like in 5 min I will get the food, but I am able to track the delivery and still the fellow not at all reached the restaurant. After several call I have recieved food with 2 hrs delay. At first I refuse to take the order, but we are in hungry I raised a complain for the explanation.  The same scenario repeated in my second delivery also. I was ordered food from nearby restaurant, which is hardly 2km away from my home. In this case also as we expected food reached 40min delay, unfortunately even the tracker also showing the same thing that the boy is nearby my home, but he couldn't able to deliver on time.  After several complains for the explanation, they sent me a detailed mail seeking apologies for the inconvenience caused and allowed me to avail 50% discount on next order. But it is not the matter of discounts and offers when it come to the point of food. The only concern is tasty food on time delivery.  I suggest think twice when ordering through swiggy, if the restaurant is nearby then better to go in person an get the food."
Ordered food from Swiggy this evening. The Food was horrible rather you can say it was pathetic. Spoke with the Floor Supervisor for Swiggy Customer Support Named Mr. Karan. He promised to send me a resolution E-mail with in 9.00PM IST. Call was taken by Karan at 6.30IST. Initially the call has been picked up by Sikhar from Customer Service he was prompt and he transferred the call to SuperVisor Mr. Karan.  No problem with Sikhar the rep who picked up the call at first place; but the Supervisor Mr. Karan made false promises to us that he is going to send us a Resolution E-mail. Which never Landed.  Stop Robbing your Customers.!  Pathetic Service!
"I have never seen any company hiding their Google Reviews and FB reviews section.  This company is not upto the mark. It is like another indian Money making machine.  Which will never take care of your order, your refund, cutomer care, returns and all.  Have been following up with customer care for more than 2 weeks now, but what I can feel they just need the money.  Once money is into their account, they forget everything.  most of the restaurant associated with them, do not even have the licence to sell the food .  Please be alert, if anything goes with your stomach or the health, you yourself are responsible for that.  So if you want to take the risk, you can order from them.  I will rate this company 1 for hygeine  0 in customer care  0 in fullfilment( as most of the options shown on the app is not avaible post order)  0 in everything else ."
I tried Swiggy for the first time. They didn't bother to tell me that delivery person is not willing to deliver for almost an hour. They refunded the money after that. I stay in the heart of the city. I didn’t understand the logic. But for sure this is not a service you need to depend on when you are hungry. They are not reliable or trustworthy. This is the first food ordering service out of everything I tried. My neighborhood shop will do a better delivery than swiggy. Will never try it again.
Hello friends swiggy.com is a website which offers food to the people. This website is different from other websites. They deliver the food to your home. The quality of the food which they supply is very good and they deliver the food in very good package and on time. The stuff which attend the call is also very cooperative point there is a tracking system for the order. The website is really very much informative. It provide all the descriptions of the food. I really appreciate the work they are doing thank you.
"The Rep told me there will be no cancellation fee and next time I ordered the fee is applied. They lie on your face, cheap madarchooths. This is such a pathetic business these guys are doing. Like pimp for food. Though I was a regular customer, they did this. Lie to me on face then charge me the next time I order, is there any ethics? I now order directly with Empire no need of pimps like you in between."
"SWIGGY.COM is one of the best website for the foodies as they have something different from other website as it does not only provide information for the food but they also provide there services to deliver the cooked food at your home.  They supply good food quality form your the best and nearest restaurant with in time which you give to there representatives.  There staff which attends the call is also very nice with there customers, they also provide tracking system for the order.  Finally I will say that this website is informative, descriptive, provide grate content and very useful for me.  Thanks."
"This app doesn't serves in all parts of India but in top Indian cities like hyderabad, bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi etc it gives you hotels which has good rating and all the nearby hotels, it gives you the variety of dishes which are available in the near by restaurant, it gives you all variety of selections as moghlai, Chinese, continental, North Indian, South Indian, etc food selection, the best service I found is in hyderabad and the worst experience with swiggy with me was in Mumbai. As they were not able to deliver the order in time in Mumbai may be that was the delivery boys mistake, therefore I found swiggy as best of all food ordering apps"
"Hi Hunger Guys,  I am on of the big fan of this website and app. Mostly I ordered food from this website or app in home or office anywhere. Mostly I can say we are getting order on time also the food quality and quantity is sufficient it's sufficient. also the price is reasonable and good varieties of food. Also sometimes we can see the combo offers and family pack. The best thing in my overall knowledge whenever I order from this website I get the delivery on time better than other website I can say. So I would recommend all of you have an idea with this and enjoy your better food.  thank you"
Used it for the first time and got very worst experience. Ordered food at 8 pm till 1:30 pm it was showing order confirm after 1:30 pm delivery executive called and said no food available really I am very upset very bad experience with swiggy worst food store.  Unable to take the through GPS or manual entry and they are not reflected even after promised time and the main thing this food store don`t have cash on delivery. Failed in proper management of orders . I will never ever order from swiggy food stored. Their customer calling I was told that I would be compensated for the delay but that did not happen.  VERY BAD EXPERIENCE I WILL NEVER USE AND ORDER FROM SWIGGY SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED ME.  THANK YOU
"I order from swiggy and as it is time assured I was sure that it will be delivered on time as it had mentioned that otherwise they will refund the amount, so I didnt imagine that they can cheat here with this.  So I placed the order and after 30 minutes(as per them it will be delivered within 29 mins) I tracked the order as didnt received any call and tracker says order is picked up now, so I waited for like 10 minutes and when I didnt get any call I called back to the delivery guy asking him to come at the place and he just cut my phone and I got a msg that order is delivered means he still has to reach n handover the parcel but he didnt consider it but to send the cnfirmation first.  Then I reach out to customer care asking for any refund which they should, they said they consider the reaching time not the delivery time that means delivery guy reach 10 mins earlier but delivered me after I called him and till the time he must be having a good view of the society in this hot summer:), and when I asked them why guy didnt call me they said he was trying but I was out of reach that is hard to digest because before that I received 3 calls and noone complained about the out of reach thing.  So am not sure how many other people gone through it. But yeah if someone else is reading so be assure that time assure is not assure:)  Suggestion to swiggy: they should update their msg to ""It is eligible for on-Time guarantee and will reach ur nearby place within 29 mins"", atleast this msg will match to their explainations."
"The interface is clean and lots of tempting photos of food. They give you option from your area and stuff thats almost an hour away so you have plenty to play with.  Once you chose your restaurent yiu get a list of all items available at the place. Yiu can also chose the quantity. The process of ordering food was quiet easy.  Once you give them All of this, they send u to the payment page where you part away with your hard eRned cash. You can pay from mobile wallet and cod also. You can save your card detais also. Good app"
I have used swiggy site few days ago. I was very hungry and I found swiggy site online and order snacks in their site. Estimates time given by them is 1 hour. But it was almost 2 hours gone they have not delivered by food yet. After 3 hrs of waiting the food has arrived but I dnt show my irritation to them. The service is too much late. No person can adjust this much delay in case of hunger. This site is not user friendly at all. Its price is acceptable but tjer is worst. This is worst food service given by them.
Swiggy is the worst online food delivery company.  I have given multiple orders with swiggy.Every sunday they will do gambling without allowing us to review our order.  I have ordered 1 biryani and 1 snack item.Instead of saying no to that.They simply added 2 biryani's sent for delivery.  It happened multiple times when ever we have tried on sundays. They are simply cheating.  Even we can put some small stall and we can sell our previous day food in our home through swiggy.  It is good to do business not good to be a customer of swiggy.  We already started that process.  Even single star is very huge for swiggy.  Their customer care always do false promises.
"Service provided by the swiggy is within the half hour. So they gives search engine portal where you can find nearest hotel to you and provide fast service within the 40 min as fast as possible.  Swiggy provide all categories about meal so there are no chance to get confusion to which meal have to choose. They provide many contents on their sites like budget, offer on meal, best 50+ hotels near you and cuisine categories.which less time it take to load information for you. I order many time from swiggy all time I was happy with service.  I recomended to all if you looking for best home delivery food service then go through this once you will never regret.  thank you."
"Swiggy is now widely used for food ordering. They have tie up with almost all kind of restaurants starting from small dhabas and budget friendly restaurants to the best rated restaurants in the city and particular area. They have option of swiggy assured restaurants and if you order from them, you get cashback depending on time of delivery. They levy delivery charges for order below 250 bucks and surge charges in case of bad weather which is very nominal. You can search different cuisines and dishes and they'll show you list restaurants serving with prices. After placing an order, you can track the time and delivery status along with name and number of the delivery guy which is quite helping.  Now coming to the negatives, there is no option to cancel your order once it is placed. So, it you did it by mistake or you want to change the order just after placing it, there is no option available. This has happened to me couple of times. Here is my experience. I had placed an order from swiggy, when it was reflecting a discounted amount in my cart and during payment also, when I did online transaction, it was showing more amount deducted from the account. I tried to cancel the order, but there was no option. I called an executive who denied to cancel my order and he said that I can't cancel order after it's confirmed from the restaurant. I tried to explain him the situation but he said he can't do anything about it and finally, I had to settle with overpaid order. I had tried to contact them through many ways including chat and mail with screenshots, but here was no response.  In conclusion, I give it a 3 star rating for positives and seeing at their not so good customer support."
"Swiggy is an international startup , it's worlds most increasing startup, the company directly employs the members to delivers the food without involvement of the hotel management, it creates a faster growing relationship between the customers and hotels, .j worked with swiggy a year back and in my opinion it is the best app ever"
I give a thumbs up for this platform. ever since I followed it since 2016. we r very happy as it seeves at our doirstwp. I will recommendthis ti everyone . so fet gounf ans u ll find this oroduct worh using. I lll give a big thinbs up fr this product. so plewast go woth my review and do wat is best fr u. plz find this helpful
I was super hungry and I was searching online about food online then I heard about swiggy.  I registered asap and ordered tandoori chicken full and broasted chicken and it costed me around 600.  I was waiting from an hour and its still in process and it took them 2 hours to be get delivered to my home.  I really hated the service and the food it was pathetic.  I'll not use or recommend to any one else.  Very bad service.
Very good app for order food Instantly and also its very fast delivery.    Absolutely hassle free.      App is very reliable.Customer support also Very helpfull.Enjoying the servise of swiggy.  It has wide range of resturants of all price groups.its very good for the varity people who wants different.Food is Delecious.  Packing is very good.i give it 10/10.  If any problem with the order the aupport stuff will solve the issue immediately.    Great apps & Service
"All this happened when I got to stay at the outskirts of Secunderabad where I didn't even have a vehicle and I have to walk for merely around 3km for hotels as ola and uber weren't functional at times.  Then, I got to realise that swiggy would be the best choice for me where I ordered food and with paytm pay, one can even enjoy the discount of around 15%. Also the delivery executives delivered the food in time which further impressed me a lot.  Though there are issues at times, I do recommend it a lot to all my readers."
"We know that swiggy mobile app is a food delivery app many type of food delivery app has bee available jist like food panda , zomato, domino pizza etc.and this app is good for developed and big city app .just like mumbai, delhi, banglor but this app is very bad app for mobile small place because I install this app from play store.But once day I not made dineer and I order food but but not asceptable my address and no deliver some product my address .so this product is not soo good for any place and any city.this app is good for seniour citizon but this app is very bad for small cetizon.and this app is not for small cetizon.this app is very good delivery , fast delivery, good food, but this is not for small cetizon.this app is waste for small cetizion."
I happen to stay in bangalore for an internship. I was there in a pg and used to eat the food from them.  Sometimes I would miss the dinner and to order food online so as to satisfy my hunger.  I was searching for many food delivary apps and finally I found this app called swiggy from one of my room mate.  I have ordered food for 10: 48 pm and they have brought me for 11: 05 pm which was very impressive.  I used to wait for atleast 40 mins on other food delivaries but this thing really functions best.
"Swiggy changed life style of people, got yummy food delivered at home. we can even sit at home and see whats cooking at near by restaurants. Best of it is tracking your order to know how much time will it take. And more over customer care executives are very friendly when we chat with them response is super quick. Providing jobs is super. Good Job"
"I ordered through and made card payment of Rs 1440 and order was confirmed a 9 pm stating a delivery time if 47 min max. At 9:44 swiggy back end guy calls to say that the restaurant did not confirm the order as they ha d power cut. Huh! By this time the food shld have reached! And even after that the restaurant was still taking orders through swiggy. And without informing they decided to refund money in swiggy money when they can analyse and see that I don't use swiggy wallet. And they say they will refund in my card after 7 days. After demon and people cancelling cash on delivery system as customers rampantly cancelled for pathetic delivery records, swiggy taking advance payment still servicing orders in same pathetic way. Time for then to shut down is only ticking."
I ordered food at 6:30 Pm and order was generated on order #1091510179. The Delivery boy Sanjay Yadav initially delivered the wrong order and then refused to deliver the right order. He also stopped taking calls and provided no satisfactory response. Even the customer care could not help and simply cancelled the order and refunded the money.  No attempt to right their wrong and re-deliver the right order!  Thank you Swiggy for ruining a perfectly good dinner!
"Placed an order today at 10:28 PM. Got SMS that order will be delivered in approx 46 mins and status changed to confirm by restaurant.  It's 12:07 AM now and status still shows confirmed by restaurant.  Been trying to call since last 40 minutes but it always places on hold saying all executives are busy. Help menu shows wait time of under 4 minutes but waited on hold once for 14 minutes and then again for 5 minutes w/o any success in reaching customer care.  No option even to cancel the order+ their help menu says 75/- may be charged if you cancel. No commitment about delivery timelines or delay scenarios in help menu.  Finally writing this review  Swiggy Cust Support sucks.  Update - got a call at 12:35 AM wherein the caller kept lying that they assigned a delivery executive whose bike got stuck and then they assigned another and then another but now no delivery executive ready to come. When I asked why it did not show on app he said it must have. I told I have multiple screenshots and can prove he is lying. He had no answer.  When I asked why he took 2 hours to inform. He said bcoz they kept assigning delivery agents in order to service the order. A white lie since restaurant closes at 11 PM.  Then he says we will refund your amount to Swiggy money. I told him to stop being unethical and at least ask me if I want my refund in Swiggy money or my credit card from which I paid. He assured it will come in credit card.  1 minute after the call I get my refund back in Swiggy money which means I either have to use them again or forget my money.  Such a bunch of unethical guys.  Wish I could rate negative.  Order no was 1090717714.  If some ethical person from Swiggy is reading(am still hoping they may have a few), please take corrective action."
"The service is horrible. I placed an order at 5.00 n they didn't confirm the order until 5.45.when I called the customer executives., jus fr the sake of getting done with the call.they assign an agent. I called the agent.he says he won't be able to go to restaurant.bt offers another agent's number. when I call swiggy.they assign another agent. we place an order when we are really hungry.if they are going to take more than 90mins to deliver.we might as well cook.this has happened to me many times.i hv never had good experience with swiggy. also swiggy money dissapears from the swiggy account on its own."
"I ordered food at home they sent it to my office and asking me to cancel the order n pay 75 ₹ charges.what nonsensical behaviour.I wish I could put negative rating for servicing n information depth.n they should be user enimy.very bad experience with swiggy.  Worst service, worst service support folks, extremely customer unfriendly  I hated the fact that I ordered from swiggy"
"Basically I remain busy in my household work as well as corporate work, I am also a very foody girl so swiggy is the best website or app for my type of foody people. I can save more as well as they have some good attractive discounts for their customers. In some places where I dont have availability of food or some restuarants who dont deliver food in some places then swiggy is the only delivery source where we can get those same restaurant food. Dont say no to swiggy only use this app once and I can promise that foodies will love this application. Guys go and get started with your home delivery."
"Heyy Guys, I would like to tell you something about my experience which I have done with Swiggy. Swiggy is a Food Delivery app.  First of all, When I was in great need of food, I opened a site of swiggy which already takes much time to open. After that I ordered a Burger and Snacks. I was waiting for the delivery because I was starving. After 1 hour and 45 minutes, I get my burger and snacks in the great packing. And after that when I opened the packing the burger and the snacks was not at all hot and fresh. I told this about swiggy but no positive response is recieved by them. They talk rudely. So takes lots of time to deliver.  So Experience of mine with swiggy was too bad and worst. Worst service of swiggy. Swiggy is not recommendable. Don't use this site if you want I instantly and fresh food."
"Swiggy is a food delivery chain.  It is, by far, the most useful and effective food delivery app.  Tasty food just a click away should've been their motto.  We order the food with the help of the app, and then all we have to do is, wait for it to arrive.  They take delivery charges depending on the distance from the restaurant.  The food comes in intact.  You can even live track your order. You can see where and from where the delivery boy is coming.  It takes a maximum of half an hour for the food to reach your doorstep.  If you're still calling up the restaurant to home deliver you the food, take a step up, and download the app."
"Hello friends, I want to share my experience about swiggy app . I was use this app first time and my experience was very good for Swiggy . the rates are not so costly and the customer service was very good . Customer service was able to help you any time . delivery takes 30 rupees which is not so high . the food I book through this site within less then time the delivery was done . now thinking about the information depth was very good in it lots of agencies they have//"
Its more than 2hours I ordered food from swiggy still it's not picked up by the delivery person and I called N number of times for the customer care people no proper response for the customers . when ever I call them they just tell 15mins more to pickup and its crossed fingers now for more than 1 and hlf an hour and no one picked my order till now . Never ever no one should try on swiggy which I recommend and this is my last order from swiggy and uninstalled the app too. pathetic service and respond for customers.  Order number - 1089634268  Name - vishnu
"My first experience with this site was very bad.  service: The rates are costly and the customer service is very bad. I ordered for food once and when I tried to order it again, it showed that delivery is not available in my area. they give a call to confirm the order, but I didnt receive any call from them.after booking an order, the tracking status showed delivery within 50 minutes from my nearest restaurant, but after 30 minutes I received a message that your order has been cancelled without any proper reason.they charge 30 or more for delivery and whenever I report my problem to the service team, they just dont listen properly and reply foolish reasons and never solve my problem.their delivery persons are pathetic and never come within the informed time.  the app and website is user friendly and load very quickly without any problem.the content is good and adequate."
"I had ordered(Order#1088124026) from a nearby restaurant and the food was delivered on time with out any issues. I was extremely happy as well. However, I repeated the order(Order# 1089293190) after 9 days and suddenly my house comes under a non serviceable area and the delivery executive refused to deliver. The executive was very arrogant and abusive. His name was Malikarjun and I had to literally call the customer support and cancel the order. The good thing was money was refunded without any hassle. I am very disappointed with whole experience and decide not to use this app again. There is no use of keeping a fancy app and having rude delivery executives. End of the day delivery of food matters. nothing else."
"Swiggy is another online food website which got instant recognition in the market.i heard it on televisions ads. and even on hoardings on the roads.so I thought of downloading it as it was a family get together at home and was looking for something to order food online.I downloaded it from my google play store and ordered some food but to my bad luck, the quality of the food was not up to my mark plus the food was also not hot.very disappointed and wont suggest this app to anyone."
"Swiggy.com was the online food ordering site in which we can order the food and now talking about service and support they will give the better customer service, now thinking about the information depth was very good in it lot of agencies they have and content was also good and user friendly service and website they have and the website does not take much time to load and delivery was also good . Thankyou."
The swiggy.com is a very fast and accurate food delivery site.the service and support by the delivery boys and also customer care was excellent.the food we book through this site within surrounding areas within less time the delivery will be done.sometimes or some stores will be charged and also sometimes we get huge discounts by booking with this site.the content of this site is there should be a proper platform to book any food from any store from this site and it should be delivered in time without any delay.till now I didn't get problem with this site.i used to order or book regularly.this is an user friendly site.the loading is also takes less time and also it depends our network. thanking you.
It's the worst delivery site ever.  There are no as such discounts in compared to other sites.  The customer care service is bad like never before. They don't present the entire menu card.  It's quite user friendly.They take a lot of time to deliver compared to the distance between the destination and source.  The time to load is OK.  I don't recommend you to order through swiggy.com instead order through zomato or foodpanda. It's much better.
We ordered pudding from swiggy. It reached on the time but after eating pudding we family member felt unconscious and pain started in stomach. Pudding was not properly packed and might be they have delivered unhygienic pudding so my experience was very bad with swiggy and I will suggest swiggy to associate with good restaurants.
"They promise you a delivery times but the food is delayed by an hour    They promise you a coupon value, but when you receive the mail, but it is a fraction of what was promised    The service is bad and delivery execs still try to rip you off at the moment of delivery      All this I spit of being a regular customer . Couple of friends of mine also reviewed negative, but the next day it gets pushed down"
These guys charge 30 rs per delivery(below order of 250) and the delivery these days get delayed by 25-30 mins. Either they are getting a lot of business thats the reason they are not bothered or their team is incapable of doing this job. High time guys or else u will be just another app.
"With so much competition in market, Swiggy failed to understand very basics of business.  I ordered food from a hotel which has delivered in my apartment so many times earlier. This time I wanted to use Swiggy. They took my order, took money from my account and after 20 minutes, informed that my area was ""black zone"" and they will be cancelling the order. I called the hotel directly after that and they agreed to deliever food. Swiggy- such a bad service and bad attitude from customer service representatives."
"I have ordered several times from Swiggy.  If you are lazy to get the food from the restaurant, then this can be the best option for you!  Their work is to just deliver the food straight from the restaurant to your home.  If the rate of the food is above Rs.150 then you will get no extra charges on the food.  But if the rate is below Rs.150 then you will be charge Rs.40 per order.  The delivery is quick, good  You can also track your delivery through the app  Try to get more and more coupons before the delivery  It's just getting the delivery!"
"My wife is not feeling well wanted to take medican after his dinner. so I order for food at 09:30 PM promising to deliver with in 40 to 50 minutes. Swiggy took my money, confirmed the order. After wait long time I started calling them at 10:50 and kept on calling then after 20 minutes they received my call n assured that the food will be delivered in next 10 minutes means before 11:30 PM. After 11:40 PM I called them again I told him are you delivering the food? They told me I call you back sir. We get a call back asking are you sure you want to get the food delivered? We said yes and they replied saying food will be delivered. with in 10 minutes. After 12:10 AM I give a call back and ask what happen now? he says that the best way out is to cancel the order and order from other service. I replied them have you lost your mind first look your watch. Why you could have done this at 11:00 PM. In middle of the night are you feel it is fit to cancel the order.?  At-last my wife taken medican with milk and went to sleep with out eating food."
"My roommates decided to order some food for change as we usually take PG food. So one of them ordered using swiggy and we never knew what was coming. We had ordered veg biryani, but the rice was still raw, not properly cooked. Raita was missing and only item worth eating were jamoons. We had to throw rice, and had to again eat the pg food. I don't know whom to blame, either the restaurant or the delivery service, hopefully they improve cause people in Bangalore prefer delivery services."
1087628693 was my order number via swiggy. On 25 april 2016From polar bear basaveshwanagar bangalore.the delivery boy denied to get my order if I dint send a snapshot of my address.i couldnt send snapshot and he just cut my call.  I have given exact address in my order  I shall never order via swiggy
They leave customer helplesss and gve automated replies and take time to respond no matter how much urgent it is.  And if u fail to share snapshot they wont help.Even suspended accout for asking compensation twice out of 10 orders.these fools dont realise how much I ended up payif on swoggy for orders but they dont care uf they lose customer over quality issue.  Their customer service is horrrible.iliterate people who cant speak english and give automated replies always.aking cusomer helpless.  Their agenda is to troll around customer. Just keeping an eye on their money regardless of customer satisfcation.  such apps be bloked.foodpanda is better.
I had bad experience of they not even assigning a pick up after an hour. If they cannot still they take order. I had to shout on call center and then they assigned an executive. They are not serious. Bunch of jokers running this.I could have gone to restaurant myself and had breakfast. Extremely disappointed. They should close down if they cannot honor their orders. Wrist experience with any food ordering app. This is the last time I will use their service even for free. Not worth the price they charge. If they pay money I expect good service at Barents minimum.
I've received spoiled and leaked item and before I could show it to the delivery guy he ran away. And to top it all when I send the pictures of the same to the customer service they said to pay only 50% refund on the item that was spoiled and leaked!  What kind of professionalism and justice skills you people have?
"Ordered Egg biriyani, we got chicken biriyani for Eggeterians. which was very bad.  Feeling very disappointed n food is not worth for money.  Waste of money. When we are trying to reach them to enqiure about we were not able to reach also.  Feeling very disappointed. Panneer fried rice was having too much pepper n Schwann rice was too spicy.  Feeling for vegetearians biriyani is not the fud to order, by default we will get chicken in that."
I ordered food from swiggy on 10th april at 1:am. But I received a call that restaurant is closed. As I already paid for my order via netbanking so I asked them for refund . But still I havent received yet and insane part is they dont reply or respond for any of my mails. Had a very bad experience. First the restaurant was closed which was not updated on the app and then this refund status. I would never recommend any of my friends. Disaster fpr those who want to do midnight orders.

"Hi, I ordered food from Dine hill(which people say it's Famous), but it's not they have worst food ever, I was Damn hungry I Oder for chicken 65, rumali roti and Paratha, but the chicken was not at all good it has some insects when we spend so much on food this is what they do, and they didn't use fresh chicken for sure, I don't know how old that chicken was, very disappointed I used to love that Restaurant and Swiggy should ignore delivering those kind of restaurants It will effect their reputation, U should check before delivering! Not Good ??"
"Hungry? need to order something? just go for swiggy, as the app serves you as you want, it has innumerous restaurants with it on the app and website as well.  best part is they will deliver on or before time, frest hot food and also they will not call you again and again to know your address for exactly where it is located.  moreover they do not charge for delivery services from their customers.  all you need is to go for swiggy, I have experienced so many food delivery sites but haven't come across such a wonderful one, swiggy you serve the best!"
"I placed an order 1030 in the night through swiggy and I called up the delivery guy around half an hour later to confirm his location and eta of the food and he confirms he has reached the reataurant to pick up my order.  After 50 minutes from the placing of order I get a call from faasos saying they are closed and they just received the order so they wont be able to fulfill the order request.  Earlier, Before calling the delivery executive I had tried calling the CC but they never bothered to recive my call.  After discussing with the restaurant guy and swiggy people I had wasted another hour and I was sitting hungry.  Then a guy from swiggy calls me up asking me to place another order from only 1 out of 2 restaurants open at around 1230 in the night.  I agreed and started placing another order and he said he will confirm with the restaurant and hung up and I never recd any call from him where as he knew what I had gone through since so long.  This is how screwed up these ppl are. I received two calls from swiggy telling me my order I had placed at first before 1030 has been cancelled. Swiggy CC is very unprofessional and senseless. The guy taking my second order after 2 hours of crap hung up and never bothered to call back and even I couldnt call back because the call would go to the call center. I had to go through so much of nonsense late in the night hungry because of unprofessionalism of swiggy"
"I placed an order sometime back. These guys have confirmed the order(1085886360) with the restaurant. However, after 1 hour 40 mins, these guys have realised that they couldn't deliver the food to my place. How irresponsible! And all these guys had to say was'Sorry'. Worst service ever."
"After Successful 15+ orders with Swiggy, Got Pathetic situation and will never forgot. got few issues with earlier but never like this. No zero rating here otherwise I should give zero star. Today order will be last order with Swiggy. Thanks for the service. Coming to today Order, Ordered Curd Rice, Biryani, Roti and Fried Rice at 8.05. At 8.20, Got confirmation - Order Confirmed.After successful 15 mins wait time, got call from swiggy saying that restaurant not able to provide curd rice instead of that we provide paneer rice(simply said with out any hesitation or no request or no information why curd rice not available). They simply answered for my question(Why no Curd Rice?), Curd rice not available and we are ready to provide panner rice. Man! who asked your paneer rice. Did I ordered it. How can you suggest that. Sorry guys and it will be essay writing to share my conversation with executive. After 2 hrs, Delivery executive gave partial delivery and they forgot biryani at restaurant(come on guys, this is minimum knowledge while picking up items). Executive cut my call while explaining this situation. How Swiggy growing from my first order to last order. Only I can say better walk to near restaurant or eat fruits/snacks and continue your work. I have waited 2hr 30mins and now my hungry gone out. Thanks for Swiggy and Bye Bye. Really Disappointed. Guys, Could you please tell is there any way we can reach this situation to higher management."
The most pathetic service that a customer can ever encounter. Had ordered for Shawarma roll which didn't get delivered even after one and half hours of wait. Later I get a call saying I need to cancel the order as the restaurant had got closed by the time their DE reached. Upon arguing they promised to replace with biryani from another restaurant which would reach in 20 mins time. With all my patience had to wait for 50 mins to get a call from the DE stating he would take another 20 mins. I was put on a conference call with the DE and customer care where the DE lies I didn't pick the call and he's waiting outside my house. I asked them to cancel my order and the DE is concerned if he will receive his payment or not. You can take care of ur DE's payment but you guys cannot take care of your customer? What a pathetic service! Deleting the Swiggy app right away for making people starve at home andget them slept starving!
Swiggy is an online food delivery app which has ( or I should say had) made life really easy. But when it was newly launched it was good only then and now its service is detoriorating and has already reached a level of worst atleast for me!  I always used to prefer swiggy amongst all the other delivery apps but now I regret giving then even that little business that I gave them! I was really very hungry and whatever I was searching was digging a hole in my pocket so I looked for coupons and that too on their app only. I was very happy to see a mobikwik offer of 20% cashback little did I know that it would soon turn into sadness!  I added money to my mobikwik wallet and was vwey happy to get the discount as every rational person would be. When expecting how much I had to pay went to the payment site they showed that mobikwik is not available! I was so furious I immediately went to help section and complained! All tgey kept doing was apologising and that they were working on it. So if a person was hungry now to avail the offer he had to wait till they would solve their techinal glitch.  Again this was not enough afyer arguing so much they finally told me that they would provide a Rs 100 off coupon on 300 within next 24 hours which would still not solve my problem as I had to order now! But I accepted it again making my mind that I would get100 off! They were npt happy to harass me even till now and when I told them to provide this in writing they completely denied saying anything as such! Again I argued woth them and they finally after an hour of heated argument gave me a surety.  In the meanwhile when I told them that I would write a review on playstore and mouthshut they told me to behave professionally. I just want to ask everyone reading this that is writing here not professional?  In a nutshell swiggy is a really pathetic app and the customer service is even more pathetic! I used to order only from swiggy but now I have to search an alternative for it because customer service is the first thing any business person should see because it is only because of us that their business is blooming!
Their core focus sud be to deliver on time and they are so ridiculous with their delivery process. I ordered a pizza and that never showed up even after they changing 3executives in 3hrs. Finally I had to call them endlessly to cancel my order and they say I will get my money back in 24hrs. So I have to block my money for 24hrs for no fault of mine. Such cases and irresponsible businesses put us(India) is such a bad position when it comes to customer service.
"Order #1083984493  Placed on 24 March 2017  2 PM  A subway sandwich from within a radius of less than a KM  Committed delivery time: 45 mins  2:45 PM and still no delivery  The tracking page shows a confirmed order and the pick up executive is not yet on site for the pick up at 2.24 PM(Past the 45 mins delivery commitment mind you)  So I call customer care  The executive tells me he will get in touch with the pick up guy and get back to me.  Fast forward to 3.30PM  No call back from swiggy customer care  No delivery  And a still very hungry me  Again I call back customer care only to be told that delivery will take some more time. How much longer no one knows but soon enough.  Finally tired of the wait and useless customer care responses  I cancelled the order and put in a mail to deactivate my Swiggy Account(yes you can do that and save space in your inbox) once and for all.  For a company in the service industry, its pathetic service and even more pathetic is the I care a damn attitude of the customer care executives.  I won't be returning to Swiggy Anymore and I hope that after reading this you'll spare yourself the trouble too!"
"I have been using swiggy over about a year now. It was all good. But recently they are being terrible at their job. I order and they do not update . The co-ordination between the delivery executives, swiggy management and the vendors is totally lost. Once I ordered, after 50 min they say that no delivery boys are around. After 10 min, the delivery boy calls me up and asks if I want anything that is there in the hotel except for what I asked."
"I tried to place an order on swiggy twice, but it failed both the times. In both the attempts, money has been deducted from my account. Initially they have acknowledged only one failed transaction and denied the second transaction even after giving reference IDs. After mailing them and chatting multiple times, after 20 days, they acknowledged both faile dtransactions and said they have initiated refund for both.  When I check after 10 days, only 1 refund has been processed and the other is not. When chatted with them they gave 2 ref ID. Then called the bank and checked for status of both. Bank people informed that there is only 1 transaction and there is no transaction with one of teh ref IDs given. SO the swiggy team has given fake reference ID.  When chatted with them again they are saying refund is already initiated but not giving the date on which it is initiated. And asking me to wait for 7 working days agin.  Overall worst app, worst support, worst service.  Even though few people had good experience, I would recommend people not to use Swiggy for placing orders"
"I ordered my food at 9.28 and I called them thrice and they lied each time that the delivery guy is 8 mins away and say that a team of 8 people are working so the order reaches as soon as possible but when I called the delivery guy directly he says he is still at the restaurant. Who the heck takes 2 hours to prepare food, idk if the delivery executive was fooling around. No wonder FoodPanda still has some demand, atleast they deliver on time.??"
I had placed 2 orders from Swiggy in 2 different days:    Order 1082578422(Dated 10th March): The order did not come at all. For 2 hours we were waiting for the food(Team of 8 people) and were being given false promise that the food will arrive in 20 mins(From 8:30 PM) for the entire duration and were given a shocker that the team could not spot the restaurant and cancelling the order after 2 hrs(At 10 PM).    Order 1082212248(Dated 6th March): We ordered for 7 curries and nan and lassi. We got Curry and lassi and no nan. I really fail to understand what will people eat when you miss the main dish. Again followed up and was committed nan in 20 mins which did not come up. This order was worth 1625 and 200 was returned next day saying that is what the nan is worth of. Issue is how do we use the curry without the main dish. We had to step out and eat outside throwing away the items delivered from Swiggy.      For both instances I was promised a call in 24 hours and an yet to receive a call after 48 hours. They don't care about customers and you will make a fool of yourselves in front of your team / guests if you trust Swiggy.
"Swiggy' advantage is that it has a good network of restaurants and they normally deliver in time. But of late their service has started detoriating as their volumes grow.  Being a regular user of Swiggy I have started noticing missing orders backed by standard apologies "" sorry for the inconvenience, your money has been refunded to your Swiggy account"".  Complaining to customer care is like banging your head against a wall. Somebody should come up with a means to address this aspect and they would usurp Swiggy's business model in a flash. I havedecided to move on. Maybe come back to Swiggy if they improve. But as of now, their inefficiency and customer care arrogance is intolerable."
I ordered 1 dish from swiggy without onion and garlic they delivered the same with onion as no change after that same dish replaced and again same thing no change as there executive don't want know the requirement and I will never ever go for this site now totally disappoint from there site after receiving this waste of time and money very very bad service and no knowledge and take care of requirement
They show inflated prices of food items  and even after discount the bill amount is greater than what would have been if you would have ordered from the hotel itself. So much for free delivery above rs 150. On being confronted the customer service didn't have any answer. How would they since they are clearly scamming people. attaching proof in form of photos. If you wanna make money be upfront about the charges don't scam your customers.
"There have been so many times I got my food delivered so late than expected and they have no courtesy to even call and tell the customer there is a delay and why there has been a delay the delivery boy would act as if he is doing a favour getting the food.I wrote a complaint last year to there customers service team they didn't even bother to respond till date. God knows if they have one. Food item listed on the menu will always be unavailable you get a call saying the food item you selected is not available change it to something else, then why show it in the menu. I have marked my exact location with directions inspite of all that you still get calls asking for directions. I once asked the delivery boy to follow GPS and he said his GPS doesn't work they come with quick excuses. Delevery boy would shamelessly ask to give a five star rating for the pathetic service they provide."
Order1: Swiggy team only don't know who is coming for delivery at last order was cancelled.  Order2: Items are missing.  Order3: Delivery boy will call customer and ask from where I have ordered food(wow) and after 1 hour order will be cancelled.  Order4: Waiting for 1 hour and at last call up swiggy customer care they said try some alternate restaurant. When I told them I need manager call. Some TL will call after 1:30hr from ordered time and tell restaurant is closed.  It's a worst service I had.  Never trust swiggy fake promises. I am deactivating my swiggy account.  I was ordering from swiggy from past one and half year. If they can provide this type of service to regular customer then think about new people.
"SWIGGY online food ordering mobile app - Should never order food through this app  one of the worst online food ordering app in the recent times.  Twice my order got delayed, my 2nd delayed order was promised in 40 minutes on 23rd Feb 2017(Ordered at 1:40pm)and when I called them to check my order status after 50 minutes from their promised time, they casually answered, it will take another 20-25 minutes, which was again not delivered. I called them again to hear a sorry message and they said it will take another 30 minutes(that's at 3:30pm approx)  And most of the times in the morning, when I wanted to order, it gives a message stating, all the delivery executives are busy in my area.  I feel they don't have enough manpower to deliver. Then why they have to promise on their app on the delivery timeline. Atleast they should have a courtesy to call and inform on the delay.  I was really disappointed & finally cancelled my food order.  I asked for a refund of the payment which I had made online, which is yet to come."
Hi friends today I would like to share my views on Swiggy app service. I made an order of chicken biryani at Swiggy at 11; 30 am and I revived the delivery by 11;40 am they given the fastest delivery I ever experienced.  Here they provide the better customer service to all as they provide two ways of payment online payment and payment on delivery. They provide the quick home delivery with in 15 to 20 minutes. You can order different kinds of food items either vegetarian or non veg or any different kinds of food items. Here we can see the delivery boy navigation in mobile app. I prefer you to use this app you will get the better service.
"Hi friends; swiggy have many restaurant chain so you can order from your nearest hotel from swiggy app or sites.  but I m telling you this sites service is very late if you want food fast so you dont order from here bcz they service is late.  swiggy website is looking cool they have nice web graphic but swiggy app is not available on windows phone and even android phone this app is hang the phone and not work properly. website information is not so clear,  website load time is normal they have cool logo. I just said swiggy work on your service time and on app support .  compare to other food site other site service is fast .work on that"
Pathetic support and service.  The same this has happened to me several times.  Will never order from this shitty website or app again.  Pathetic support and service.  The same this has happened to me several times.  Will never order from this shitty website or app again.  Pathetic support and service.  The same this has happened to me several times.  Will never order from this shitty website or app again.
"I have used Zomato, food panda and swiggy for home food delivery. As I am a foody type myself I wanted to tell you guys which one is better.  Zomato is hell, please dont order there. Food panda is good but not close to swiggy. Swiggy is the winner among these three.  Service:  The delivery is prompt and fast. Atleast within the promised timeframe. And they make sure packing is good as well.  Website:  Fast, user friendly and easy to search the food you want to order.  List of restaurants:  Till you live in really outskirts. By outskirts I mean really outside cities, you can avail their facilities.  Support:  Once you place the order. One person from swiggy calls you and keeps in touch if the time is delayed. The behavious is good."
I am foodie guy I love eating food and ordering online at most I ordered a food from swiggy for very first time in last week and that was very horrible I cant say I ordered my food through online app it was taking lots of time to get load and really irritating then I saw some beautiful dishes and orders one of them at 1.26pm in the afternoon and delivery time was around 2.30 pm I told its OK ill wait I waited and called up customer care at 2.45 they were telling you have ordered a food from another area and it cannot be delivered so we are cancelling the order after 8 minutes of conversation then I got a call from a guy he told very exactly is your address I am from swiggy I directed him and he came the food was not hot I think it was kept in refrigerator and tightly packed tasteless food no taste and I will never order from them now on wards.
"I order from swiggy regularly mainly because there isn't another choice. Totally unreliable service. Order takes more than an hour especially when you pay online. Sometimes there are no complaints but most of the time they do not deliver. I ordered today and it has been an hour. I called the delivery guy and he started saying his bike stopped working and just very unprofessional. So to sum it up, just go and buy your own food. It will be faster and more efficient and cheaper"
"I had very bad experience with swiggy. For an order they have received online transaction and denying to return back and technical concern. even after writing 10 emails to them with transaction proofs, they are replying with only one copy paste message of contact your bank, but they are neither accepting their mistake nor paid the amount back. very bad of them.  Kindly use cash on delivery service only do not do online transaction with this website"
"Every time I ordered anything from Swiggy, they always messed it up - at times the delivery took more than 2 hrs, sometimes the delivery boy refused to deliver, sometimes missed half the food in the restaurant, and sometimes delivered an open package. Its better to not eat anything than ordering and getting frustrated by swiggy.  Swiggy is not sending the food from the actual restaurants you order. Please call and confirm from the restaurant one you got the order. Make sure you get the bill. There are lot of incidents happened where the restaurant food when you eat is different from when order from swiggy. Better don’t order any food from swiggy. Very bad service. They should improve their service delivery quality a lot."
"We had ordered PIzza and we had it spilled( all toppings and cheese to onside of the box). It happened twice and the order was from two different places.  The first order was from pizza hut and when we complained to swiggy about the issue, they didn't repond to our email.  The second order was from Papa Jones and the delivery guy got the pizza by tilting the pizza to put in plastic cover as he was on two wheeler. Obviously the pizza will be spilled. Don't they have common sense?  When we complained the same, they didn't take this matter seriously. I would suggest not to order through swiggy. I am not happy with their response when I reported this issue."
Swiggy.com is an online food delivery company which is grasping its roots in India.Their service is very poor and lazy and the support is also very non-responsive and untrained.Tge information depth is very low as they rely on the local food delivery vendors.The content timeliness is very low and non-updated for months.The design is simple and comfortable to use and the usability is also good.The website load time is very slow.
"I have try swiggy 2 times, but both times I fell sorry of me for not using foodpanda or any other site, they cost even with no minimum delivery crioteria. Its have less number of restaraunt merged with it, it sevices is not so good, its fails in its first impression.  Service& support:  not so good, with no proper sevice.  Information Depth:  Its not provide information depth about the restaraunt and about the foods.  Content timelines:  not well as mentions  Design/usability:  not good as foodpanda or zomato.  Website load time:  It take long time to load and display."
"It is very nice to use we can order food online there will be delievery charges above the 350, thete is no DELIVERY CHARGES less than 350 there will charges the food will be very fresh and we can order any type of food which u like we can order the food for the breakfast lunch dinner and ice cream s and we can also order the cool drinks it will take time as per your order location it wiil reached by the delievery boy we can also get gift coupons and for the new users there will be discount upto 25% it will be fresh food"
I have used swiggy many times to order food mainly because of the fact that you can track the delivery in real time. It is transparent I feel and delivery boys cannot cheat you that they are 5 mins away when in real they are 1 hour away.  One more thing which I liked about swiggy is the they are ready to compensate for bad quality food also. Offers are given at time which is good for customers.  One thing I would suggest is of the packing charges which they charge should be waived off as it hurts to pay extra just to pack the food.
"I wud not even give one star to this cheating app, I ordered food on 31st dec, der executive took 2000 rs from me on the bill on 430 by saying that he will get the change and he never returned, when I called him he sd I ll get it Tom as he can't find d change, next day he dint call me d entire day, when I called him, he told me that I have spend d money and I will return to u when I will get my salary, I was shocked by his behavior, I complained to swiggy, it's been3 days but no response from these ppl, I wud seriously not recommend anybody to order food from this app, they are cheaters and they are not responsible at all"
"In Bangalore Karnataka  On 1st Jan 2017  A Bad Start and Pathetic New Year Experience with #Swiggy, #Pizza Hut and #Freecharge On January 1, 2017, at around 8:40pm, I have ordered a Meal for 4(Veg) for Rs.697/- inclusive of taxes+ delivery charges. Plan was to enjoy with friends and celebrate the new year eve. with good food while my friends really like pizza’s, so there was no 2nd thought on ordering food from #Swiggy. However the evening 1st spoiler came at 9:10pm when the #Swiggy delivery boy came with a wrong order and taken it back ensuring the right order delivery in next 30min. or so! By this time the new year evening was already been spoilt by #Swiggy, as my friends started leaving due to feeling of Monday Blues! It’s not it yet! Here came the 2nd back to back wrong order at around 10:00pm, after a long wait of more than 45min. with 3 main items being missing. Also none of the pizzas were in good shape and completely cold. Surprisingly even after a long discussion of about 30min over the phone, with the #Swiggy customer care agents(Yogesh and Arvind) Despite giving a commitment of refunding the complete amount and taking care of the ordered food, no resolution been provided. And during this entire mishap, my evening was spoilt, and I could not order anything fresh as it was already too late in the night. Over and above, such a unprofessional behavior from #Swiggy and team on a special day, was really sad and unethical. Worst is what? That, I did not get any refund and a call back, even after the assurance made by the #Swiggy customer care agents. I am a very consistent customer #Swiggy customer, but this incident and its resolution was pathetic and so unprofessional from #Swiggy. I need a resolution at the earliest today, or I am going to use my consumer rights to write about this incident to FSSAI, Consumer Forums, All Possible Social Media Channels of(#Swiggy, #Pizza Hut and #Freecharge.) And I am ready to take this up, to whatever level it needed be till it addressed.  Anshul Choubey Swiggy Pizza Hut FreeCharge"
Online food order site swiggy.com is not promising.  I order some food through swiggy.com  I am able to select restaurant easily but while selecting food I faced many issues like if I selected 2 items and again if I want to increase the website is not responding properly(hope they can improve on this).  The delivery time has taken more than an hour.  As it is winter the food is completely becoming cold and it loosing the taste which needs to care.  Not at all happy with the swiggy.com
"Issue 1: Swiggy App:  I have noticed that the debit card payment option on the swiggy app does not work and I reported this to the team in October 2016. I don't see it fixed still. It works on the web link but not on the App. This is happens with few others I checked in Bangalore also.  Issue 2: No refund even after a month:  On Nov 30, 2016 Swiggy charged me twice for the same order, I would generally have expect an automated reimbursement from Swiggy the same day which didnt happen. Since then I have called them atleast ones every week to check on the status and each rep I spoke to mentioned they have processed the reimbursement. One of them even sent me a reference ID for the refund, which has not reached my account, even after giving them 5 to 7 BDs as requested in the email. I called the customer care again today and was told they marked my account for refund but no one has processed the refund! So I need to wait another 5 to 7 business days. and so the cycle restarts.  Shame on Swiggy! I have been a loyal customers of Swiggy till date but the issue 2 just made me loose a little trust and respect for this team."
"Swiggy has the worst services of all. They have no coordination and take the money without checking if the particular item is cooked in the restaurant. I have placed order with Taste of Ganges restuarant thru Swiggy today, 25th Dec. I got a call from Swiggy, Hyderabad office that certain items are not there and he will call me back with confirmed menu in 2 mins. The call never came. So I had to call them. I struggled to explain the lady the items ordered and confirmed. She repeated the menu and when finally it was delivered, it was wrongly delivered. The delivery man it not aware what he has delivered, he doesn't know what conversations I had with Swiggy representatives. Finally when I called Swiggy again n asked to deliver the rest, representative said it cannot b done for the system will not allow and I have to order again. It was simply a ridiculous behaviour n service by Swiggy. Its just awful experience. Please never order from Swiggy as they dont give u any value added service and complicate your life"
"Their way of handling their customers is very unprofessional. In one of calls after I sent in an email regarding these instances I was offered a dessert to call truce. Several customer care calls that took place during the wrong order was like ""Sir, please speak to X person, I am not right one."" Talking to the X person, ""Sir please speak to the Y person, I am not the right one"" and this happened for like 30 minutes. Well, I am surely not ordering from Swiggy anytime soon."
"Swiggy has been a great revolution in order food online websites  Service is fast and they provide good support to customers  Many restaurants are available in Swiggy.com, you have lot of options to choose  Design and Usablitity are really good its quick and easy to use  It has no minimum order which is beneficial delivery charges will be 40/- for any order below 200/- and above 200/- delivery is free  Loading time for Swiggy.com is quick.  Worth trying it!"
"I have ordered food around 9:30 am around 12 the order has been delivered, the delivery guy desperately roaming here and there, when I call him he says I lost the route. How can one lost the route once they are on GPS enabled device . Shame on the Swiggy's administration part . This is not the first time it happened to me. I would say don't order food on swiggy. My experience with swiggy is been worst, the service by delivery guy is even more worse."
"I'll make sure the customer care conversation goes live on my digital media. Swiggy. a waste of time, pathetic customer support and terrible experience. My friend told me to get through as a last resort but still I ordered. While tracking they gave me the delivery guy's name and showing me his ride. And then after an hour they r calling me to tell that they have failed to convince the delivery boy to deliver the food. Nothing can funnier and stupid than this. When I questioned back as y am I told now, they r quiet. And disconnected the call. Not picking my call again. Never ever use swiggy."
"Worst Management, I ordered something around 10.30 pm but I didn't receive it till 11.30 pm, then I called them and enquired about it and they said my order will reach within 15 min. but after another 30 mins. they called me and told me your order got canceled coz your location is too far to deliver.Actually they delivered me the same food from the same hotel many times but this time they said too far to deliver, at least take responsibility of your mistake rather than lying about it.Never going to order from swiggy again and will tell my friends also not to."
Don't know sometimes what happens to this swiggy food delivery team. I've given an order on swiggy at 10th dec after confirming the order they took 15-20min for checking there delivery executive if the delivery executive  is not available then after 30min they directly cancelled my order without informing and kept the money in there swiggy wallet. Next on 14th dec using the wallet money i've given an order & this also they repeated the same thing again cancelled my order finally after 30 min! Such a waste online food delivery.
I have been ordering for quite some time but never felt this way. Ordered from flavour of North restaurant swiggy delivery guy calls and I guide him where to come and he talks rude by name Mr Ravi. It all starts from here. Order doesn't get delivered. End up calling swiggy. Customer support and spoke to many guys but no one could provide solution even after standing on road for almost 1.3 hours nor had the order deliver to us. May wife and my 2.5 yr son are left with option to sleep without food. not even one guy could resolve for 2 hours and they cancelled order and now no restaurants open. Seriously don't try with them. Worst support. No discipline.  Highlight of their worst service.    All executives will blame u and believe delivery guys    Delivery guys doesn't pick my call nor swiggy care guys call.    Con call with swiggy care and delivery guy and the delivery guy says he will not deliver at any cost.    They fool you big time with no control over their systems and employees
I love food from swiggy its real tasty and hygenie. till now what ever I have orderred really njoyed it. And the good thing about them is they deliver according to our convinient. They have real good service. And coz of they online payments you can njoy good food even if ua cashless ??
I would like to share my worst experience with Swiggy. We were regularly ordering food from Swiggy for the past few months. Suddenly my account was misused and food accounting to an amount of Rs 2200 was ordered without my knowledge.Repeated emails and calls to the customer service could not give me any information regarding the transaction.Now I have decided not to order food from this site. And I suggest all the readers not to prefer this site for ordering food!
"I do daily orders, if you choose one item which showing 45 min delivery time it mean you going to get it in 75 min why?, They don't have timer in app, when you place order 5 min will take to confirm the order then delivery guy will be assign in next 5 min and then this guy will on the way to the restaurant he will reach there, then he will wait for order if you are lucky then order will reach to you in 45 min."
"Dear readers,  Writing this genuine review, after having bad experience from Food delivery Swiggy.  cons-  1) They do not have standards, they deliver from any local hotel down the street.  2)Their delivery package have no swiggy logo or anything to say they are from swiggy.  3)The delivery boy is also not wearing uniform, he is just a random person.  4)Worst thing is the food, Poor quality and poorly packed.  Over Swiggy other companies like food panda, fasoos are better"
"I had faced bad experience with Swiggy for each time I had ordered.They don't have any assistance for you if you don't hold any current order.What the .  Customer care staff are the worst people on this planet,only keep saying SORRY for your every query.  Supposed to got my money back as 0nly ONE item was delivered out of FOUR.  I chased two times for my money,then I felt ashamed for asking back my money,but SWIGGY people not.  PLEASE DONT ORDER FROM SWIGGY!"
I had ordered food on Sunday for my kids and the guys came back calling food not available. And second time the order was updated.  After 30 mins they came back again order not available again.  After 1.5 hours too much of confusion in a company with multiple rounds of funding. Shame.
I recently ordered few starters and main course items through swiggy app while booking the order the swiggy app was not responding and very slow it does not even open the app and remained in a unresponsive state for about 15 mins after few trails I finally booked my order and after that the app showed me that it would be delivered in around 30 mins but the actual delivery of the order took more than an hour and I was very disappointed by the service provided by them as the app always miss functions in crucial times when ever I require them.
"Pathetic service.no resolution provided.executive reached late . more than 41 mins for swiggy select . time mentioned in your system was incorrect, still according to that also it was 46 mins .Actually order reached me in exactly 55 mins. Delivery person was calling and giving vague address, that he was standing near house no 311 . However there is no such house number in our locality. He was simply lying .I was in conversation with your chat reps that order did not reach at 8.17 pm. Chat rep informed that order was delivered at 8.12 . actual delivery time was 8.19 .placed order at 7.26 pm . Still did not get a refund as per Swiggy Select policy . when they had no answer, they informed that this is system generated. However system calculates on the basis of input. Disgusting experience. will never recommend Swiggy. I will make sure to spread the word in Social media as weyll"
"I HaD UseD The ServiceS Of SWIGGY.

Swiggy provided good service till recently. I had a bad experience today. I placed order at 7:30 only to be told that it cannot be delivered at 8:45 after multiple follow-ups. I decided to uninstall swiggy app and I will not recommend swiggy anymore. I was a loyal customer all these while and spoke good things about it but now I only have bad experience to share. Wish you improve the service
Pathetic cheats. Ordered food for Rs. 751. After one hour they informed that restaurant does not have items and to cancel the order. They agreed to refund. Asked if I wanted it in swiggy money or to bank account. I wanted it back to my bank account since I was not sure when I would use the service again.They refunded Rs. 499 to account. Lost money for no reason. Never ever use this service. absolutely pathetic
"Full planned cheaters.  We ordered food from swiggy, they sent some infected food and we called to complained. I said I want to escalate to food inspector. They begged me to not. But still no response. I am planning to put a complaint against them.  Not sure if they sent me the food from the restaurant I ordered or from a road side shop. This guys are cheaters"
I placed an order using the Swiggy app. Their system took out payment from my Paytm wallet but failed to register the order. Their customer service kept saying they can't find the payment on their system but if payment was taken out it will be refunded within 2-3 days. For a food delivery service that is to be completed within one hour why should anyone wait for 3 days for a refund. The worst part was that they were not even able to trace the payment. Worst service.  Imagine if you had organised a party for a few friends and placed order only to find that your two or three thousand bucks going missing?!?
"We have been using Swiggy for the past one week - this happened due to their constant non stop ads on youtube - I finally decided to try it. App works like a charm but what we love is the feature which shows updates - once the rider reaches the restaurant, once he picks it up and finally the real movement of the scooter to our house. Its exciting and the kids love it.  Three orders till now, all delivered in time. We have had issues with foodpanda in the past(order cancel, delivery time etc). So far so good with Swiggy"
"I am a very good customer with swiggie, spend over 25000 in 2 months, the service has been ok mostly a lot of problems they face depend on the stores they are tied up with for e.g. Fresh menue lunch orders after waiting for over half hour the swiggie personal call and cancel the order, a lot of orders have been considerably late over an hour. most are on time the staff is usually very nice . last week I placed an order from Watson for about 900 Rs, 2 of the gravies had spilled completely and after giving all feed back and pics and talking to 4 swiggie executives . still no refund only promises that something will be done in 24 hours . it's been a week and nothing. if it was cash on delivery I would have simplywithheld it but because it was on my credit card I'm stuck. unacceptable"
"#SwiggySucks on 16 oct, 1pm Ordered(1069553321) Chicken Biryani and Dessert but got Mutton Biryani instead. I called and asked for refund saying entire order to be returned. They said they will pick up entire order and refund full. They made me keep waiting but nobody came to pick up. at 8pm I was told they will not pick up order so I threw out entire order. I followed up for refund for next 7 days everyday but they gave me partial refund saying desert was correct delivery. Swiggy, can loot customer like this because we don't have time to complaint and sue you for small amounts. But I am not ordering again from Swiggy app."
Worst experience don't even order anything from sweegy. Instead of veg food they will dilever non veg food that too without tag. They have no sense of work. Never ever order from sweegy. It's he'll service and 0 value for time and money. They don't have sense between veg and non veg.
Do not ever order from Swiggy.I placed order for matka biryani and delivery guy delivers order in broken matka and plus 1.5 hour late. He dropped food plus giving some lame excuse and asking to keep food.I returned food and let everyone never place order through Swiggy.They always deliver food late but today was height and I had to place order from somewhere else.  bad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad servicebad service
"I am a premium customer of Swiggy.com that has been placing orders regularly ever since they launched the service. Time and again, I faced a lot of issues, but I supported and continued using their services hoping they would improve their services and take my feedback seriously. Below are some of the MANY issues they blatantly ignored and for that reason, I stopped using their services and they seem to be least concerned which is good for me because they are the ones losing buisness. good luck to them  1 - mis-represented images that mislead customers to order food items that are otherwise poorly cooked  2 - the order notes is limited in characters and even if I write something, the stupid hotel fellas do something totally opposite, for example if I ask them not to make it SPICY, they make it more SPICY, ha ha and this is outrageous and I informed to swiggy and they say they will take action and guess what is their action? To remain silent, ignore and move on.  3 - Their customer care executives are brain washed with pre written scripts like any other call center - we regret the inconvinience, we are sorry, bla bla and what then? nothing happens, no follow ups, not concerned about any issue  4 - their address loading is undoubtedly the WORST FEATURE, it first asks you to use a saved address, then it keeps LOADING and never shows address and when you call the customer care and inform, it says that particular HOTEL is busy delivering food to others and they ask me to log out, clear browser cache, re start my mobile or laptop, all funny troubleshooting measures that never help.  I can keep writing all day about their disgusting performance, but I have better things to worry about. .Swiggy.com, you cannot take customers lightly and think you are going to prosper, I was giving your company business of 15, 000 Rs per month and had plans to recommend others to use, nut now not only am I quitting, I also asked all those I recommended to stop using your company's services and you guys deserve this. sorry if I am harsh, but this is as polite as I can get.  good luck"
"They have a section for instructions during checkout after selection of food items. instructions are for restaurant to customise food according to our wish, but these rogues never take these instructions seriously cuz they have uneducated and rogue delivery executives who can't read english. why do ya have such option if you don't have respect for customer. swiggy ha become rogue delivery service, don't order food through these guys, they are giving better ratings even to third rate restaurants. swiggy the rogue delivery service."
The delivery executive have no sense of talking to customers.It just seems like they are hiring'rowdies' who only knw to threaten customers if they are asked an explanations for delay in services. And the so called Customer care service line which is suppose to help customers does nothing instead of putting you on hold and making you repeatedly hear the automated voice' you are are important customer and your call is important to us'. Definitely the app stand UNINSTALLED NOW!
"I have been using swiggy for last 6 months. From last 3 months the service is worst, my last 10 orders delivered atleast 30 minutes late. And when I contacted Customer Care the response is always very late and they always say "" We will try to deliver it quickly"" but the same delay is repeating again and again.  And recently I found match sticks in food and when I have complained the same the just took it normal and said we will inform restaurant.    They don't have required number for deliver boys is hyderbad so all orders are getting delivered late    They not even verifying the restaurant back ground before adding the website, so all poor quality ones are getting listed in website    They don't have customer care people to handle calls and chat so your request will be in queues fort hours      Stop using this poor quality service and Save your money and health"
"I placed my first order on swiggy.com for breakfast and kept tracking the details.The executive was assigned on time and reached the restaurant quickly.But the order was so so late that I had to chat 2 times with the agent and also call them .The ETA was 45 min and the agent kept telling that they are sorry for the delay.Then the order came after 1hr 30min. Now the food part .Ordered 4 idli, 1 vada and 2 kesari bath from mysore express tivoli theater secunderabad.The vada was burnt, sambar and chutney were tasteless.When I chatted with the swiggy team they mentioned they cant do anything except reporting to their supervisor.Very disappointing."
Swiggy is the new buzz in Food delivering industries. I have seen many advertisement also so after all I have decided to order food through swiggy for a new experience.  I had signup in swiggy through my frnds referal code. After Signup I got a coupon worth RS 150 redemable with minimum order 350. After that I have order food by applying food coupon from one of the restaurant through making netbanking payment .  After that I have waited for long period arround 2 hours but didn't got any response from there end.T herfore I have contacted customer care of swiggy they replied me with a reason that your address were not traceable so that is why order have been cancelled.  In that particulad time I was feeling so much angry as well as hungry also. But nothing to do with that situation. Thereafter I have instructed them to refund the amount to the source from where I has been deducted and they also said that they will do it and it will take 5-6 working days.  But after 5-6 working days I have knocked them multiple time for refund the amount but they always make false promises and just skipping the issue.  Just one hour ago I have called them for the same issue now they are saying that they will not refund the amount so I have to use it there without coupon code.  I am sharing this issue to aware people that my amount was small but might be such kind of inciednt might happn with u at very important time when some guest have arrived at ur place and you have ordered food with a large value.  In that tym two things will happen:-  1) You will be ashamed in front of your guest  2)Your money will stuck in swiggy account  So beware people.  Better to avoid swiggy and start using ZOMATO.
"Swiggy.com - Fu@#$S!  They stole from me!  While ordering food, I used aishwaryasingh23tm to make the aishwaryasingh23ment. During transaction aishwaryasingh23ment errored out, but aishwaryasingh23tm passbook shows swiggy order#.  I checked with swiggy team, they dont have the details of the order and hence they are not ready to help on this issue.  Checked with aishwaryasingh23tm and they said the transaction is successful from their end and they wont be able to help here.  At the end neither swiggy takes responsibility nor aishwaryasingh23tm takes responsibility.  Amazingly both have such a pathetic customer care, neither of them have CC contact number to talk to a representative.  aishwaryasingh23tm - write a mail about the issue  Swiggy - chat or write email(within 255 char!)  You can call swiggy, but only if you have active order. Otherwise go to hell!  I would recommend ppl to uninstall both this app and never use their service. They are not worth running the business this way."
"The food was given to Swiggy from Dehli 9 Gachibowli at 18.35 in the evening. I live 6 minutes away. At 20.03 the driver arrived. I told him to take the food back and refund me or get a fresh delivery. Why would anyone want food that had been on the motor bike for 1.5 hours? I then received a text saying ""your delivery has been delivered"". I have asked Swiggy and Delhi for a refund neither of them will do so. Swiggy have stolen my food claimed it was delivered and Dehli9 have been paid.  Disgusted by both businesses. I've been into Dehli9 twice and they just say: not our problem.  Also I think it's important to add no one at Swiggy seems to have GPS."
"This is the inside story, I worked for swiggy as a delivery executive for part time and it's not us who delay the orders it's them who give us late, I even tried it myself ordering and even for us they don't give proper salary and said me I'll kill you if you ask money again soo they didn't give my 3K as it was weekly payment and I just left the job avoiding all the drama. and as a customer they delay it by minimum 2 hrs try it yourself for me it's just the worst!"
"In india, people are looting at will and there is no law or system to stop this looting. swiggy is one which is looting in the name of surge pricing. if there is  rain, we don't mind paying extra.these rogues are using surge price even when its not raining. you guys are going to loot people whole rainy season like autowallahs. why should I pay extra when delivery guy did not travel in rain.these rogues are exploiting people even though its not raining. swiggy is synonymous to characterless rogues."
"Hi Friends, This is regarding Swiggy app. I saw some reviews about Swiggy, all r telling Swiggy delivered bad food, no response.But in my case, My order is not delivered that is Swiggy. let me share my experience. I have ordered Pizza from Pizza hut using Swiggy at 7 pm on thursday, I was just waiting till 10 pm, finally got a message from Swiggy that order was delivered, I am just surprized and called delivery executive- he was switched his mobile(  +919741618489, his name Raja.B), immediatly I called customer care and explained my story, they said u will get it soon, but no use.I sent a mail to support to return my money, they are simply telling we were delivered ur order.  My order number:1066946260.  Guys, Iam requesting you all.I spent only 400/- on my order, that is not and issue for me. But dont use Swiggy app and buy anything especially in Bangalore.Even worst customercare I ever seen.  Please dont trust Swiggy"
"Hi Friends, Compare to Foodpanda, swiggy is the worst online food delivery app, i've ordered 2 chicken biryanis from Paradise(Ntr Gardens) about 345/- but there is no chicken pieces at all, I am very disappointed to see the product, immediate I contact customer support sent pictures of biryani & received mail that my money getting refund to my account, still there is no revert on the same issue & if we complaints anything, we'll not get the solution properly. Order No. 1066685359, worst experience ever seen before.thank you guys."
"I am writing because I had such horrid experience with swiggy today.  My order number is 1066516749. The delivery executive delivered the product without the lemonade that was promised in the combo and when I spoke to a guy named SOMSHEKAR, he promised that there would be a  refund because it has happened before. But they never keep their promises. They are going down. Please dont buy from SWIGGY. they have turned for the worse.  I m so disappointed. I am the one who orders in my office for many many people and this would be the last time I would order, Good luck in getting a loyal customer back."
This App has fooled the people to great extent . They have made a business of tempting the innocent customers by showing them beautiful pics of dishes from books and made fake resturants tie-ups to ilure the people . T he food delieverd is totally different from what is ordered . T he taste remains same everytime you order same dish from different restaurant . This has put a suspect into my mind that might be they have common kitchen where they cook and dispatch the orders as they donot give wrappers if the restaurants . Might be corruption somewhere . Serious enquiry should be made into all these food based Apps .
Today we order through Swiggy at Pune. As One of the dishes instead of Prawns Kali mirch murgh Kali Mirch was sent. We made online payment and we were charged as per prawns which was additional Rs. 70 plus taxes. The delivery boy Jawed Tamboli was extremely rude and did not want to call the call center. He only did so on our insistence. I spoke with your call center personnel Sangam . Sangam assured that he will send the replacement dish and we should then return the wrong one. THEY NEVER SENT THE REPLACEMENT DISH AND YOU HAVE OVERCHARGED ME ALREADY BY Rs.70!  Is this how Swiggy functions? I am disappointed with the service and this conning of your customers. This is exactly why I order daily from Scootsy in Mumbai and Zomato in Pune where I am on weekends . IF THIS IS HOW YOU CON YOUR CUSTOMERS AND ARE TRYING TO REDUCE YOUR LOSSES YOUR VALANCE CUSTOMERS WILL ALSO RUN AWAY! I HOPE YOU WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE TWO PERSONNEL OF YOURS AND RETURN MY MONEY BACK!
"Initially I was happy that I had found a site in Hyderabad where I could order all I wanted on days I felt lazy or didnt want to step out. Recently I realized that swiggy was swindling me. It not only lists all restaurants- bad and good, it doesnt have mechanisms in place to address issues/complaints immediately. I had a bad experience of  a restaurant sending food having sand, tasteless, overpriced and on top of it the delivery executive refusing to giving change. I immediately wrote to the swiggy customer care and it has been over two months now and the matter still persists.  I had ordered the same dish from the same restaurant once again, in the hope things would have changed, but no, it was the same. I wrote back to their customer service once again and it is only after 11 days I get a vague reply, that they are looking into the matter and will settle it.  I am pasting the order id's here just in case someone from swiggy would be interested.  order no- 1064427182 and a previous order id- 1064242915  I am scared to think if it were a case of food poisoning how would swiggy act?  Swiggy website lacks the following-    No provision for customer rating    completeness in terms of content    Immediate customer redressal in case of complaints"
Very unprofessional reply got from Swiggy.  They had delivered stale food which had very bad odour.when contacted Swiggy their formal reply was “we will take up this matter with restaurant NOTHING else…When we contacted Restaurant they didn’t pay heed to my complaint according to Restaurant “order was placed by Swiggy with certain discount so they are the one who are responsible”.  I urge to everyone order directly from Restaurant as they also gives discounts.Here Swiggy doesn’t have an onus. Very Bad Service.
"Swiggy.com I am sure you all heard the name of best or delicious Food from your favorite restaurants delivered, I am gonna share you of my experience with Swiggy.com I usually order all my favorite delicious food from various restaurant in one step home deliver provider Swiggy.  I heard a lot of complaint about swiggy all that, when I start up to order but I haven't faced any problem even they do have good deliver executive nice behave with customer's.  And I would they do have good apps for smartphone where in we can track the delivery where exactly executive is reached or not and customer care support wow! in a right time they inform to customer, so I am using swiggy service always when I hunger."
"SWIGGY made life easy for foodies like me. I have been ordering fast food via swiggy in delhi and quite happy with the service provided by them. swiggy works best for fast food. this is what I believe in.  Fortunately I never had to call customer care for any complaint. but yes, it does deliver food a tad bit late but that can be ignored watching  the traffic conditions in Delhi. overall I am quite happy with the service provided. I hope I was able to answer the doubts you had in your mind."
SWIGGY is the fastest growing online delivery food mart from where you get the maximum possibilities of the availability of the restaurants near by. It is responsible for delivering the hotter food hot.And chill food such as icecreams really chill at your door step.  One of the greatest feature is that you can track the agent responsible for delivering food and they notify you at the same time for instance when they pick the food up.Also u may store as many addresses as u want for the sake of travelling and ordering from place to place.Great food and cafe chains are listed on swiggy for instance even StarBucks is listed on swiggy and Giani's as well. you can get food from anywhere at the fastest rate.One of the feature which I like the most is that you can even suggest them the restaurants.
Swiggy is a very good online food order website iw was the first online food order website the delivery is very fast and the quality of food is very good and the coupons which they give is also very useful I ordered so many times with swiggy and everytime they give very good and fast delivery it comsumes my time when iam busy with other stuff it is very easy to order food on swiggy they give very good customer service.
"Hello,  Please be careful when you apply coupon code on Swiggy.com,  they are offering 150 off when you order above 350 rupee for First time order, Yes I apply coupon(NCR150) and it reduce 150 from my total bill but when I reach for payment transaction on bank's website, it again added 150 rupee to my order .  After that I place order without coupon code. then it show me message that my transaction failed, and I notice that money debited from my bank account, and I didnt receive any order number or transaction failed details. I had to contact customer care to get failed order details"
Swiggy was the first app for online delivery of food with no minimum order. The others all have a minimum order of Rs. 300 to deliver your favourite food from favourite restaurants! When swiggy was new it was very good compared to others. They also had this referrel coupons and stuff but now they dont work.  I had earlier ordered from swiggy before it was closed down in kolkata and did not have much complain from it. Although I was not very happy but it was tolerable. The food was delivered a little late but then it was okay.  Now again they have some offer about referring friends and earning Rs. 150 . I referred my friends but when applied the code it was shown as invalid coupon.  I do not understand if they do not intend to fulfil offers why do they give it at all! Moreover not all restaurants are listed on it. Even nearby cafes do not deliver to our locations.  The restaurants list should also be increased. As it is they take atleast 45 mins they can take 1 hour and deliver it to us from a little far ones too. I  After my first experience I wanted to order again on swiggy but I guess they do not want us to order. They do charge a delivery cost but then that is okay provided they fulfil their commitment! Now the offer is only till 31st of july and by the time they reply to our mail and help us the time will be gone!  Moreover now my money due to be refunded 20 days back is blocked and their is no sight of them when we mail them! Such pathetic service please beware before ordering food!  If swiggy management is reading this please increase your delivery locations and give coupons only if you can fulfil them. List more restaurants on your site so that we can make use od your services.
I ordered food from swiggy. After 45 mins I got a call from somebody that one item is not available then I changed one order. Then again I received call from them that lunch time is over and we can't deliver the order. They wasted my 2 hours and after that I didn't get anything. Now they are saying that they will refund after 5-7 days. I request everyone that plz don't order anything from Swiggy. There is no option to fill very poor here.
"I have used swiggy quit a lot and its good . the concept is really cool , they deliver food from any reataurant you like so you can have it where you want to like burger king doesn't have their own delivery service so you can use swiggy to order food from burger king or any place for that matter . the delivery time is on the higher side , it can take from 45-90 min so order accordingly and they don't charge extra for delivery and the best thing about swiggy is there is no minimum order rule you can order food amounting 100 buck . that's cool isn't it ?  the food delivered was nicely packed and hot so my experience with swiggy was great ."
"I had ordered from Tpot via Swiggy yesterday. Half an hour after placing the order, somebody called and informed that two of the three items placed are not available. I asked for an alternate. But the food quality was horrible. The Breads were stale and was not even properly grilled. Guys, do not waste your time, energy and money to order food via swiggy. It Is not worth it. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL."
"HI friends,  I just ordered food from The egg factory via Swiggy.  I am not satisfied with the quantity and quality. Veg fried rice was stale and after paying  Rs. 160/- if you are still hungry then you can think of the quantity.  Now a days people are only good at starting business but are failed to maintain the customer value because they know very well that ""one will go, another will come"".  It's really disgusting mind set not a single start up is running on the fact of customer satisfaction. They are only looking for money.  either ignore The Egg factory or Swiggy.  totally unsatisfied, good thing is order delivered on time."
"I hear alot about swiggy food delivery and so ordered twice on this. Unfortunately I had a bad experience both the times. First time I took around 1 and half hour to get my food delivered, the reason they said was the area with I live in its far from the restraunt and mote than their delivery radius. The second time I have ordered from a different place and this time it took around one hour, even the restraunt was near by, when asked the delivery boy about this he didnt even give a proper reply. And even the customer service is also very bad, no one responds in the chat or call options. I think atleast a proper information should to provided to the customers and some manners should be taught to the agents."
Swiggy has the worst food delivery service. Let me give you couple of bad experience that we had over the quick span of 3 days.    After applying the coupon the final cost shown was for Rs.93 but when the transaction was made Rs.193 was debited from the account.    The order was placed at Kolapasi restaurant by 8pm and alas a call came by 9.30pm from swiggy that they have cancelled the order. This was very pathetic when we got a call from Kolapasi asking us why was the order cancelled as they where waiting for swiggy to pick up the restaurant.
I don't compromise with Food. Swiggy.com is one of the online portal that I often use to order food.  The website is simple with elegant background. Its very easy to navigate which helps to select the desired food from the best restaurants.  Things that I like about this website  >Varieties of options.  >Simple to navigate and select the best option.  >Easy access to many of the great Restaurants.  >Safe and secured payment options. Cash on delivery available.  Things that make me little annoyed:  >Very Poor customer service.  >Refund policy is little slow.    I will rate 3.5 out of 5 to Swiggy.com and yes I will also recommend this to others.
I think everyone should now know how technology is growing day by day.hence people should know that ordering food has become alot simpler now with SWIGGY.I have been using swiggy from past 6 months.n its great till now  CONS:-  1.They reach on time or before time in most cases  2.More than 100 places to chose from  3.no extra charge leaving delivery of 20rupee for orders below 300 and container charger  4.food is hot  5.swiggy representatives are good  6.you can track where your excutive has reached  7.easy refund  8.earn discounts and combo offers from different restaurants  I had a great experience.i open swiggy app daily to see new offers and land up ordering good FOOD:)
"They dont deliver what you order and are arrogant when you tell them the problem . I ordered Veg Szechwan Pepper & Elephant Garlic Noodles, they sent me Stir Fried Assorted Vegetables and I asked for an apology for spoiling my meal, they refused to apologize.  Their contact numberer is  only answered if you are willing to wait for 20 minutes on hold . Stay away from this company. Such arrogance will only lead to their failure."
"Really bad service. neither did they understand what we are saying nor have any idea of locality! Why can't they use navigation instead of irritating the customers when they don't know a single thing about the area.  Horrible experience. Its better to go out and eat instead of waiting for the order to arrive. After hours when it finally arrives its all cold and not at all tastes good, should have called the restaurant directly instead of asking swiggy."
"Issues I've faced:Deliveries delayed by over 2 hours.  Wrong order delivered.No delivery and no update.No refund after delivering wrong food.Once their delivery boy lied to me about where he was.Then I get customer surveys to fill and they call their customer service, customer delight team!"
I had placed an order yesterday and made the payment online as well while placing the order.  The delivery is 2 hours overdue and no one from customer service is responding.  Is there any way I can get a refund of my payment? This is the last time I am using Swiggy. Very unpleasant experience.
"Dec 31, 2018  STUPID SIDDARAMA, illiterate driver, could not read address or was too lazy.  I gave CLEAR address and instructions with landmark, even on CHAT. The office staff FAILED to relay the info, and this worthless piece of lumpen garbage called SIDDARAMA accused me of giving address incorrectly and cancelled my order.  UNACCOUNTABLE, UNPROFESSIONAL, inbred lumpen retards who refuse to take responsibility for ANYTHING!  I have been getting deliveries here, with SAME ADDRESS, SAME INSTRUCTIONS, yet both office staff and STUPID SIDDARAMA accuse me of giving address wrong!  I even checked the tracking map and saw SIDDARAMA sitting on the wrong street because HE deviated and turned right after being told REPEATEDLY to COME STRAIGHT!  Gandugiri, plain and simple. Swiggy has ZERO HR standards, only hiring worthless garbage."
"I have been ordering via Swiggy for stuffs like coffee, pizzas and other such fast food without facing any problems. Saw quite a few negative review may be the services in Mumbai is better than other cities or possibly Swiggy works best for fast food joints compared to those of ordering advanced meal for a restaurant.  Never had to speak to a customer support so I cannot review that so will give a 3 for that being neutral.Although the duration taken to deliver is tad bit long but that is manageable."
"I had received an incomplete order from Fujian on 24th on 11/06/2016. I had ordered a Thai chucken green curry which usually comes with a portion of rice but the rice was not delivered. When I called the customer service to raise a complaint, the service agent was rude and unhelpful.  He insisted that since rice is not mentioned in the cart, swiggy is not responsible for delivering it and as per him the order was completely delivered. I tried reasoning with him and even told him that I had called the restaurant and confirmed that rice is included in the dish but he was not willing to accept any responsibility for it and didn't offer to even check with the restaurant. I am extremely frustrated with this experience. I had to cook my own rice which actually defeated the purpose of ordering out!"
I had placed an order from Subway ar 12.45 noon & received my order at 3pm.Yours is the worst delivery service possible.if you do not have trained people who can locate addresses as mentioned in the order & dont have the requisite capability -please do not start such a company & fool people.i have had to starve for 2 hours & waste my time & energy coordinating with the delivery boy who just could not find the address after being right outside the gate.  He would not pick up the phone after calling him so many times & he was extremely stupid to have left the order with some other place & updated the status as delivered.i have never seen such unprofessional service in my life & will tell all my family & friends never to use your service.
Worst and stupid service they are nit even worth of getting single star it should go in negetivity waited for more then 3 hours after rhat landed up giving reasons never ever use rhis application to order food one of the worst and disgusting service ever I have experienced it
They just do not check the orders and send anything. I had placed the order for two vada sambar and they sent just one. Order number is this.(Order #: 1056421711) It was a waste of time talking to their customer care. It took more than an hour for me to make them understand the entire situation and get the money refunded. My child was very sad because of this. I will never place an order again with them. Had a terrible experience.
"Hi All,  This happen to me today 24th May. I receive an email as given below:  *Hi there!  Ever wondered what it's like to have the food truck experience in the comfort of your own home? Now you can try it!  Get 50% OFF on a minimum bill of Rs. 200 from AutoExpress in Hyderabad. Use code AUTOEX50* to avail in Madhapur, Marredpally, Himayat Nagar, A.S. Rao Nagar and Sainikpuri upto the 29th of May, 2016.  So what are you waiting for? Order Now!*  And I ordered the same seeing the resturant opened @ 7.30 pm IST. And after about 30 minutes I get a call saying that the resturants are closed.  I mean why in the earth did swiggy got the offer and why do they cancel the order.  There customer service sucks big time. No idea how to talk to customers.  I suggest to go with Foodpanda and Fasoos atleast there are human whom you can speak not unlike swiggy Robots."
App which gets you best food and amazing deals.i just loved the app. Every one should give a try to it once. And one of the main reason why you should use this app is it delivers food at your door step in short period of time and you have to just save the address at once and rest the swiggy will take care of it.
This is app has third class service executive do not  know how to speak and respond back . I had very bad experience and I would suggest to use other food services. Swiggy please wake up and improve service  Thanks.
"Heaven's Kitchen(Order #: 1058400505), May 11, 2016  The customer care service is pathetic. Accountability is missing for items not available with the restaurant.  This was my last order from Swiggy.  This is the second time the swiggy team denied to provide a particular item.  The Kirana store give better service than this.  Really disappointed with the service.  I will ensure that nobody ever place order through swiggy."
"Yesterday I order Jain pav bhaji from swiggy, after some time received called from swiggy that the food is not available & we are replacing your food with the other jain dal khichadi. While I received that order, I found onion & garlic in that. So I raised an complaint against it.  Almost 24 hours completed to raised complaint. Still I will not receive any response from the swiggy.  I am very disappoint with such service of swiggy."
Swiggy is a food delevry company. thay provid food at fast delevry partnar.  when you think for eat swiggy will serv you. This is a amasing app. Swiggy provide discount coupen on evry refral. I alway eat in discount. I seggges you use for first time this app.
"Worst Food Delivery App I Ordered Biryani In this Swiggy Biryani has to be Hot But It is cool. And  They took Time Nearly 2 Hours I Did Payment Online And I am Not able to Cancel The order I faced problem nearly 4 Times. But Still I ordered Food In this App Because I don't Have Any More Option. And We Has to Pay money For Delivery. They are cheating customers.  They charge you VAT and Service Tax, even though the restaurant doesn't. Even if the restaurant charges the taxes, And Food Quality And Quantity Is Worst Cheap Quality of Food They Delivering. I think They Tie Up With Hotels and Restaurants For Low Quality of Food. Just Think Why They Are Giving Offers Then(M.R.P) How Its Possible Why They Wants To get Loss In business. Just The Thing is  Swiggy Playing Cheap Tricks. Please Don't encourage This Type of apps and Websites."
"I usually do not write online reviews but this incident actually forced me into writing one today.  My food is 2 hrs late! And the delivery boy has just reached the restaurant! OMG. And all their executives have to say is'please cooperate'.  Worst possible service ever.  And this has not happened for the first time! Last time the order was so late that I had to cancel it finally. Never had such a bad experience with any service company in any domain as that with Swiggy.  They are just living off due to lack of competition. If they do not improve, once a decent-at-best company is around they will have to pack up from this industry.  To fellow readers: If you want to order from Swiggy it is your choice. I wrote this review to inform you to not expect delivery on time. EVER!"
Don't order thru Swiggy they are cheaters!  Swiggy is good!but Swiggy managers and delivery boys are worst! Better go thru Zomato or Tinyowl!  Worst worst worst! Especially chennai Swiggy deliver guys they drunk and delivering food! Worst management! Don't order thru Swiggy Swiggy Swiggy Swiggy don't order food
"I would just like to say that if you do need to order food, then order it only via Swiggy.  Frankly they deliver the food faster than the delivery time of the place you actually ordered from. For example, and it's just one example out of many instances, I once ordered from Burger King and they took 35 minutes to deliver my order, Swiggy did the same order a week later in 15 minutes.  And what they charge is literally negligible."
Would not recommend this service to anyone.  Is this for real? I was told Burger King has no burgers?! And this is after a payment has been accepted. Customer service is most unhelpful and daft. The only refund option is to my swiggy account. Why on earth would I want to use this website again.  Startups seem to be the new trend these day but back up your idea with some credibility. This is unacceptable!
"I am writing this review after using this application recently. I was in  mumbai last month. I heard about the swiggy through my colleagues. I decided to give the try to the application & ordered my first online food using swiggy.  I just got surprised by the service and the quality of the food. it was just awesome. The delivery time by the swiggy was very less, it was hardly 20 min after my order. The best thing was I got great discount on my first order. I would recommend it to every one who wants to order food online. It has great choices of the restaurants chains covered."
"I ordered food from Ghar ka khana in Hadapsar, Pune. The paneer was rubbery and not up to the mark at all. Also I did not get my complete order. However I was charged for full amount. The aloo raita was messy and looked stale. Swiggy did not verify my order and delivered a partial order but took full payment for the same.  Also there is no follow up from Swiggy on this. This is really poor and pathetic service from Swiggy!"
Hi friends today I will share my experience with you of using this swiggy.in . Recently I heard about this site which is used to place order from nearest restaurant but when I was placeing my order then I got the coupon of 50% off I was so excited to use this but when I place order from this site this coupon was successfully applied and my order was just going to place the site stop working and telling that these all restaurants not in servicable area.i felt so cheated and this just ruined my time and made frustated as I was very hungry .  Worst site for food delivery.
Unprofessional lying scumbags all over the place  the people who delivery tell all sorts of lies and blame the tracking devices saying that they are on time or whatsoever  the customer care is pathetic and rude filled with 6th std drop outs who have no clue what is happening  and the order always comes after an hour or so inspite of booking during normal traffic hours like 4am or 2am in places where traffic density is really less
"Swiggy cancelled my order for no reason and sent a mail that I called them up and cancelled the order. Customer support was of no avail either. They expect me to order again after 1.5 hours of waiting. Not at all reliable. If you have guests and order from them, they'll definitely let you down.  I hope they shut down with the kind of insensitivity they exhibit."
"Swiggy the biggest cheater of all time!  These guys has tieup with PayTM for payment gateway but most of the time they screwup customer with technical issues. There are days(specially month end), I emdup with no lunch. Because of these guys blocking my money and later(may be 24/48hrs) crediting to Swiggy wallet instead PayTM wallet to earn interest on customer money. Shame on U guys!  I have been ordering from almost last 2 years and everytime some or the other issues. Worst service ever!"
"I started using this app since the day it was launched. Their service was much better then. There are many issuses with their service now a days. Most of the time they keep on showing the message that all our delivery executives are busy now thus making them not at all reliable. They serve the orders late. But the positive point is that they serve every delivery at a min cost of 20bucks in a radius of 5km. No minimum delivery limit . As their tagline says large or small, swiggy delivers it all."
Good app guys I never seen such a appp I never seen yaar its good appp for eating when u order items it will reach within 5min and 1stly they will give also coupon and but it only in cities not in villages but they will developing each districts and very thanx for guys
Its been 3 months when I started using this app. Huge varieties of restaurants are available on this app. I have ordered food regularly on this and am very much satisfied with it. It also gives occasional coupons which are very interesting. Delivery of the food is ontime and delivery boy also treats customer very well.  My Verdict : Compared to foodPanda this is much superior. I can suggest to go for it.
We paid online and waited for 3 hours. We did not get food  besides struggling to get the refund which we have not got till now!  Neither food nor the money the back. You cannot call or approach at any no. POOR RESPONSE PATHETIC SERVICE AND NO NEWS ON THE MONEY PAID! THAT'S WHAT SWIGGY IS!
"This is one of the most important website i've come across, recently. I've always never had a problem with their service. We get hundred Swiggy money on every referral. We can use this on every order above 300 rupees.  The minimum order eligible for free delivery is 250. Below that, 30 rupees will be added to the order amount. I feel that the restaurant ratings should be linked to a reliable source like Zomato because the ratings provided on Swiggy is sometimes misleading.  I've had times when i've ordered food from a restaurant on Swiggy with decent ratings, but, the food has been terrible. And sometimes the restaurant timings are muddled up. If  they improve on these fronts, the user can have a much better experience."
This app solves one of the biggest problem for urban youngsters that is food when mom is not home and you are lazy enough.  Their service is very fast and the food remains hot and fresh when you receive it.The range of restaurants available on the app is very wide and you can choose from a whole lot of range of food.  The interface of app is user friendly and pleasing to the eyes.The delivery staff is cooperative.  And their offers make it even more attractive.
"All was well until I saw the actual prices on the menus of the restaurants featured on swiggy.  Swiggy rates are higher. Next time ask for the bill. Go and see the menu of the restaurants and then see what swiggy app is offering. It is a scam. Customer care says will arrange call back, still waiting.  I have stopped using this app. What cheats! Better walk that single km and get your food at the restaurant price. plus .They lie"
"I placed the order from one of the restaurant in kondapur hyderabad. and I chose to pay via internet banking and now this became the prepaid order.  I also got the message from swiggy that the order has been successfully placed and u will receive it shortly.  I waited for half an hour. and tried calling their customer care, they said order is on the way.  I again waited for more than half an hour and I lost my patience.  and this time I called the delivery guy whose number was mentioned in he mail, he said ""sir, tumara order cancel ho gya hai. restaurant me dish available nhi hai, apko customer care se call nhi aya kya?""  I got astonished. I did not receive any call frm their customer care.  I again called their customer care and this time they were saying sorry and ur order got cancelled.  they should have called me on their own to inform that. after waiting for more than 1 hr and when I called them from my side they are informing that order got cancelled.  when I asked them to refund my money. they said yes.  but till now I have not got that refunded money. I have dropped them many mails but still no proper reply.  worst swiggy. never go for it.  worst worst worst.:("

I was totally unaware of swiggy as I never order other than foodpanda. One day me and my husband coming from mysore and we were so tired to go any restaurant and have food. Suddenly my husband told me order from swiggy. I was wandering what he was talking. So he told me about new swiggy online food delivery at our doorstep. I went through the nearby restaurant and ordered as our choices.  The amazing thing is that there is no minimum amount to order.  Cash on delivery option helps a lot. We arrived night 10 clock and the food arrived at my house 10.30 night. It was so hot and fresh. No complaints at all. Swiggy good option for many young students to have food. At office if any party or meeting is there very good option to arrange snacks.

Swiggy.in is one of the best site for ordering food items.It very good website in this swiggy website I booked a orderfor six plate idly and six vada and 7 jamoons on one by two restaurant in malleshwaram as soo as I booked the order I received a call from swiggy for confirmation after confirmation the service boy came to home door step and delivered with hot servings of food.  No extra serve charge is given to service boy  as soon I saw or opened I found idly vada in a freshly as I ate in restaurant  so when ever I want to book the food items to be booked and discounts to be added I use this particular website  When booking is done on line they serve food speedy service is very good I order the food items in this site just because discounts is given for every booking  SO I suggest every one must try it.
"I have ordered food from SWIGGY(from Palamuru Grill(Madhapur) on 1st Feb 2016.  1) Chicken biryani 2) Boneless Chicken Kebab  The chicken biryani was spoiled definitely that is not prepared today and I guess not even yesterday. After our complaint they have replaced food with Butter nans and paneer butter masala.  Second worst experience in the same day. The curry taste was as worst as butter nans. I lost money, a nice evening turned into terrible and slept with hungry.  I don't know why swiggy was tied with this kinda of restaurants. Finally I decided not to have food from outside, Thanks for the lesson Swiggy and Palamuru Grill.  Moreover I noticed that there is no option in swiggy to give any review of the food/restaurant which we ordered."
I haven't seen a food delivery startup who delivers food within 20mins for almost all my orders.  Swiggy has featured amazing restaurants not only local but also the ones which are kms away from my house. The live tracking system in their app is also amazing to track the status of our order.
"This has happened innumerable times. They never update the app properly.  Every time one orders, a call from swiggy would come stating such or such item is not available and theu would like to edit the order whuch would be usually above the order amount placed earlier. Its either their tactics of increasing the order amountg or they are lethargic enough to update their app information accordingly."
This very  good website.in this swiggy website I booked a orderfor sixplate idly and six vada and 7 jamoons on one by two restaurant in malleshwaram .  As soo as I booked the order I received a call from swiggy for confirmation . after confirmation the service boy came to home door step and delivered with hot servings of food.  No extra serve charge is given to service boy . as soon I saw or opened I found idly vada in a freshly as I ate in restaurant . so when ever I want to book the food items to be booked and discounts to be added I use this particular website. When booking is done on line they serve food speedlyservice is very good. I order the food items in this site just because discounts is given for every booking
"This is the best app to order your food.  just download the app from playstore and register with your phone number.  you can deliver your food from any local resturants at the same price.  if your ordered bill less than 300 rs they'll charge extra 50 rs for delivery.  if ur order is more than 300 rs no charges for delivery.  Cash on delivery service and very genuine.  service is very good, quick and neat.  you can also earn 100 coupon by referring this app to your friend.  i'm suggesting it to every one, best service every seen like before, i'm regularly use this app for ordering my food."
It is the website we can order food and many types of food is available and  our stomach as asking for variety types of food then we can order the food using the android app and website and in this swiggy we can order food and healthy and delicious food and it is providing time to time delivery to our door step and it is the swiggy refer and earn is also good I always do refer and earn and I advice to order food in this swiggy for variety types of food available only in one android app and they providing good service and faster delivery .
This is the best food ordering app I found I have used several app like foodpanda and tinyowl and I found swiggy best amongst others.  I like it because its different from other food ordering apps and sites and what makes it different is that every other app they partner with the restaurants and delivery is done by the restaurant but swiggy hires delivery boys and deliver it themselves and the benefit of this thing is that there is no minimum order and youcan also order a single product of Rs.10 also if you want which is really goood and the delivery is also faster than the standard restaurants delivery and they also offers various discount offers which is also good this the main app from which I order my food or snacks.  there is nothing to worry itsa very good site I have ordered from it a lot of times and if something happens they will refund your money in your swiggy account if thats a prepaid order. Sometimes the delivery boys are unable to find the address but we cant complaint that. so overall a very good site.
"I am quite surprised seeing the number of negative reviews Swiggy has received.  My experience with Swiggy was quite different and it was very much satisfactory.  We live in a hostel so on a random Sunday, Instead of going out to have dinner we resorted to order food on Swiggy.  We ordered 2 Chicken Biryani, 1 veg Biryani and a 2.25 ltr cool drink bottle, the order was processed and delivered to us within 30 minutes and I also received an promotional discount of 100.  So a big thumbs up:)"
"Swiggy is the best online site for food delivering.it delivers the food less than fourty minutes.  There are many sites like foodpanda, tiny owl, fassos but all these are costlier as compared to swiggy.and also time is less as compared to other food delivering sites.  This app shows restarunts near you.this is the awesome app.i order food in chotiwala restarunant from swiggy they delivered food in exact thirty minutes.Tracking system is also available.you can track where your food is."
"Feeling cheated after seeing this, MK DABBA WALA rates are lower than swiggy, or we can say that swiggy is selling products higher than the MRP.  Do I know why.?  Also I ordered khova matar planner combo which includes gulaab jamun but gulab jamoon was not delivered to me, I called the customer care& they said that the delivery boy will come and deliver the jamoon in 15 to 20 mins, but no body turned up even after more than one hour, I again called the customer care to enquire so they said that the delivery boy confirmed that the gulaab jamun is already been delivered.  I am feeling cheated& shame on swiggy, double cheating in one order."
"Swiggy is one of the best food delivering Applications. This app shows all the nearby restaurants to our place. From which we can select any of the restaurant/bakery. And then add to cart the required items from the menu. No restrictions at all.you can order starters, tiffins, meals, etc.  Swiggy delivery boy will pick-up orders from restaurants and deliver it to customers. It provides customers with timely deliveries and the best feature is real-time tracking of the order status."
"Swiggy & my experience:  Swiggy is one app which was never adviced by someone nor I saw any ad in tv or social websites. I came to knew about swiggy coincidentally. Currently, I am staying at Delhi and most of the restaurants are far from my house. Being a girl, it's not always possible for me to go outside after 7pm alone in the streets of Delhi.  One day, I was very hungry and I wanted to try some chinese noodles. Since, I am new to my area, hence, I don't have any idea about nearby restaurants. I searched online and browsed through zomato.com. I found a restaurant( Pema's) that serves South Asian delicacies. I immediately saved their number and reached at the restaurant. There I saw a small sticker posted in a wall written as swiggy app. So, I installed it to order from them via online.  I have tried every possible way to order from that particular restaurant as home delivery because it's not possible for me to visit their restaurant most of the time. Hence, I mostly prefer home delivery.  Why I found Swiggy as the convenient app to order food for home delivery? As I have mentioned above that I have tried almost many ways for home delivery from this restaurant via many apps.  Following are my experiences & comparison:    Firstly, I tried via zomato.com. As zomato is a very well known web for browsing restaurants, hence, they were offering home delivery from the particular restaurant too. But, the only issue was with the minimum order amount. Their website is charging minimum of Rs 400/- for the delivery. So, its too high to afford mostly and this restaurant provide too much amount of noodles just for Rs 160/-. Hence, there is no need to order for Rs 400/- instead, I am getting enough food at Rs 160/-.    Secondly, I have tried calling their own restaurant number. Their own criteria is different from zomato. Their minimum order is Rs 200/- and if your order above Rs 250/-, you get a free delivery or else you will be charged some Rs 50 / 60 for delivery. Once, I ordered above, Rs 250/- and it went quite conveniently but their minimum cost of a dish is Rs 80/-/ 90(momos depending on veg / non-veg). Rest dishes costs above Rs 140/-. So, if you don't want momos then, its totally useless to order momos just to adjust your minimum order. Hence, I decided to try the third way.    Thirdly, I installed Swiggy and ordered from this restaurant via Swiggy. I wasn't sure if they will deliver or not dur to so many negative reviews. I ordered for cash on delivery. Swiggy charged me with some packing charges of Rs 5 and free delivery. I ordered the same noodles again for Rs 140/- and got a free delivery within 1 hour. The Swiggy delivery boy was so polite and humble.      Again, I tried Swiggy to order a south indian thali from other restaurant. I just paid the food amount as per restaurant menu and rs 5/- packing charges with free delivery. I got my order again within 1 hour.  Pros:    A convenient app which charges the same amount written in restaurant menu    Free delivery with less packing charge    Hassle free and quick delivery    Cash on delivery service is the best    Polite delivery persons    Many options of restaurants based on your location      Cons:    App is unable to locate exact address, so, you have to add the address during the checkout.     Conclusion:  Since, Swiggy is a convenient way to order food, so, you must try it once but my suggestion to prefer your first order as cash on delivery. Different area have different restaurant options as per the location. I had good experience with swiggy and I will continue to order food via Swiggy."
"Swiggy is the best food delivery app available today.There are many apps available today like tinyowl, Foodpanda etc which are much costiler when compared to swiggy.  The best part of swiggy is that there is no minimum order value for restaurants, whereas in other apps there is minimum order value for each restaurant.Swiggy also provides many offers for its users.The delivery time is also very less.There are many Payment options such as COD, PAYTM, Credit/Debit.  The bad aspect of swiggy is that it is available only in some parts of the city.I would recommend Swiggy over Tinyowl, Foodpanda etc."
Worst Service .please don't ever order any thing from these people. if the order worth less than 200 . they simply say that order is not available.even if the order is available.worst service I never had it before.please think before you place an order with these people. I recently ordered chocolate products from Chocolate room. the customer service person calls and says that they is no chocolate products available at chocolate room .Funny Guys.
"PATHETIC SERVICES. FALSE COMMITMENTS AND  APOLOGIES ALWAYS FROM THERE SIDE. ordered food many times, mostly faced order delay, order cancellation and order mismatch problem. Always asked for another chance but always failed and today posting after giving many chance. Customer service is way bad. they hung up they are so defensive that dont even listen to customer. AND WHEN YOU WRITE COMMENT AND SAY DONT RING THE DOOR BELL BUT CALL. THEY NEVER FOLLOW THE COMMENT. THEN WHATS THE POINT?  They did it again guys today, they got no shame. No respect for cx and for their food.  Very POOR service guys"
"Horrible experience with Swiggy Pune. They took the order, accepted and after one and half hours, they called that they can not deliver order as restaurant is closing now as its 10-30 now and they still have other orders! What a stupid argument as we had called at 9-00! Also, they informed at 10-30 so we could not go anywhere. With ban of Maggi, it was our night when we had to sleep hungry!  I was cursing foodpanda earlier that they deliver after 2 hours(considering it as worst) but swiggy has proven that somebody can be worse than foodpanda too as they dont deliver at all. I had immediately uninstalled their application.  Education institutes highlight that there are lot of great IIT graduates who come with innovative ideas and so, IIT is the best education. But, what we see is most of these people are not innovative but just rather copy-paste one idea(within few months, lot of food delivery companies, lot of grocery companies, lot of payment wallet companies) - all start with huge loans/fundings and then cheat/frustrate their customers and close their shutters in few months - all money gone in promoter's pockets. Swiggy is also few day's guest and will not be visible in few months. This is what is the INNOVATION by all IIT engineers now to pocket money in few months and leave banks bleeding."
Swiggy is the new online food ordering website.It is both availaible as website and also as app.  You just need to allow the app to pick your location via GPS and you can to see all the nearest available resturants. To my surprise I found many small resturants or resturants who provides snakes in swiggy.  The best point is there is no minimum order system in swiggy.Mean if you like a small items of Rs 50 you can order it by paying a small extra amount as packing charge.  I ordered using the website twice and the experience was very good.I ordered missal pav and cold coffee.They charged Rs 10 extra as packing charge which is fair.  The customer service is very good.They take your response and works works towards it.  The app works brilliantly loads fast and easy to use and also shows the approx value of food for two if you ordering from that resturant.I will definately recomend this website.
Today we are seeing how the online business has emerged in our country in every stream of different products.  And one of these I like to talk about is swiggy that is online food delivery services which is a great boon for the people it saves you big time and tension of what to do today for eating you think it is silly but it is a big issue for ladies.  But they no longer want to bother about cooking because whenever you are not ina position to cook you can simply order in swiggy a variety of food stuff you can choose whatever you want which is linked to your local restaraunts and hotels.  The swiggy app is good and ui is also nice we can easily order without any effort and you get your food within an hour.  Cash on delivery option is also there.We can choose from large range of items through swiggy.  Students who are living in hostels and rooms can be very well using of it because they can see hteir works not bothering about food.  Delivery also good with hot food served with out late.
"I like to use service of Swiggy.in.  Till now just two times I have used swiggy, both experience was good and will use more in next coming days as it is really provide good service to us.  As we all are pure vegetarian in our family and also fond of good food. Here in South India just few places where we can gets pure vegetarian food, near by our home there is Bikanerwala, that is branded and good quality pure vegetarian food, but going there daily not possible, and good part it is listed in Swiggy. So I have ordered first food item from Bikanerwala via swiggy. They delivery hot Idlis in just an hour, food quality, taste and packaging all perfect.  The service from swiigy, using their app very smooth, less space it cover on smart phone, they also provide good offer like 80 rupees off on 300 bill, less time in deliver, can pay online also cash on delivery.  Really very nice app. No need to book seats and reach restaurant on time, just order from an app and wait less and enjoy more. Their online chat facility to ask query also great, fast reply."
"This website is total waste and so is their service. We waited for 2 hours and the food arrived cold and guess what, it was wrong order. There is no way to contact customer service.  The delivery guys are rude and are not ready to listen.Total waste of money and time.  Never going to order  from swiggy.in again. The customer care number online is useless as you can never reach them due to so called ""heavy call duty"". The delay as we said is extremely huge with wrong order and no customer care to follow up with.Here we are 10PM in the night getting wrong order and that too cold.I dont think anything gets worse than that for food delivery service.Try some thing else.SWIGGY.IN is total waste"
Swiggy is not as good app as others.it referral programme is not very nice.its delivery is very niece.but packing is not food.they doesnt provide attractive offers as compared to others.the customer care service is also not good.the just take rhe complain but doesnt solve.
"Dinner at 11:30 PM. Thanks to Swiggy. I have never faced any issue from any others like food panda, amazon flipkart, blue dart, jabong, snap deal,  lime road, big basket, ola, uber, etc. Your startup is like Bangalore's roads-filled with pot holes.  Thanks for the partial refund. I will not give you a chance to serve me any more nor will I refer my friends or my family members. Also word of mouth will prevail. Thank You"
"Apart from the service charge that is applied sometimes, I guess this is one of the very few food service providers that are actually trust worthy. You can order your food at 10:25pm and you can be assured you will get your food no matter what.  Prices: Reasonable  Delivery time: fantastic  Food options: mind blowing in comparison  And not to forget, the customer service contact is always friendly. They do not give you bullshit and are never rude. I've rarely heard anyone talk about a refund happen at Swiggy.  You get exactly what you ask for.  Great app, great people, great service!  Cheers!"
"Once I ordered food. They delivered wrong food. When I tried to contact their customer care. No one lifts the phone. I even mailed them about the matter, but no reply. Worst service ever. I would never recommend anyone to use swiggy. They should improve their customer care services."
The worst service ever.I order food online and the website shows it is placed successfully but again it is not.the website always shows incorrect information.never trust swiggy website or the delivery boy.waste waste n waste.must stop fooling customers.  I can stay without eating rather than being fooled.please make sure you do not make a fool out of a person again or stop doing this business.This is the 3rd time I'm facing this issue.i ordered food from a restaurant that was open in the afternoon but still it showed closed and not knowing the reason why
"My Self Advocate VSK Gupta, I request everyone just stop using Swiggy anymore, their applications is worst I will show you that they can deliver the order to that place and after an hour or two hours you will receive a call from customer care stating that the order cannot be placed because of 8 kms and they can deliver only till 5 kms, I dont know how they have designed their application. and this is third time I tried and fallen down by aishwaryasingh23ing money for them.  I am anyways santoshkr80 lodge a complaint against them and I should know whose mistake is that, if you loose money its fine acceptable, but playing with emotions of people is always dangerous and harmful. Count your days Swiggy. if any one interested in joining me please mail me @ advocatevsk9@gmail.com ill be happy to assist you."
Swiggy Ordering food from restaurants near you.  PROS:  Download it on your device and you get RS 100 off on first order you make.The delivery is very fast and has linked up with good restaurants.They dont charge anything for the delivery.it even shows the how far our order has processed and ones its dispatched we can track the location of the delivery boy. so it is pretty easy to order and use swiggy and moreover they have many restaurants to choose from thanks to swiggy.  CONS:  But I think it is only available around 5km  radius.It should spread all over the city. I would recommend swiggy to everyone.
Today I ordered my first order in swiggy.The service is very good.I ordered from a local restaurant and the quality of food is excellent.There are many ways of payment in the app.  The delivery of food is very fast when compared to other food ordering services.Swiggy gives many offers to their customers.Swiggy is available only in some areas of the city.Swiggy is the best food ordering service available in hyderabad.  I would recommend swiggy to everyone.

"Swiggy is a app you can download on your phone that enables you to order food from nearby restaurants and bakeries. It has a huge list.  I was reffered to it by my friend and recieved a voucher that let me order worth 200 and get 100 off. I ordered my food from paradise masab tank and got nice discount. I wasn't even charged for delivery.  Once you order, the swiggy staff will soon start showing your status of your order in your app. The delivery boy calls you to confirm address before he leaves restaurant. You can see the delivery boy in real time moving on the road and coming towards you which is amazing, unlike foodpanda, and tinyowl.  The food was ordered in time and was hot, the delivery boy was polite and courteous.They have the biggest list of restaurants, their offers and their excellent service makes me buy again."
"It is an online app for ordering food. I have heard about this app from my friend when I created a new account in this app with my friends referral code I got a voucher of hundred rupees and then we used it  for purchase of chicken biriyani worth rs.200.  And got a discount of rupees hundred the service was fast enough and the app is  Comfortable to use, it even shows the how far our order has processed and ones its dispatched we can track the location of the delivery boy. so it is pretty easy to order and use swiggy and moreover they have many restaurants to choose from."
I feel swiggy is another online biz scamster in making. loads of hype and poor service.  non responsive .  yet they are funded.  wonder if this is another scam.  they recruit notorious guys for delivery or boys who have no knowledge about city geography.  incase if your ordering on swiggy most likely that you may not get delivery and to your surprise u get a message saying that its been delivered.  wondering how much money they ate away  this is a scam for sure

"I placed an order for salad from yogisthaan considering the quality of food, but I got the delivery with poor packaging and salad looked horrible.  The dressing was spilled all over the packaging and no spoon and fork given to eat. they charge 210 for the salad but the food looked so pathetic to eat .  10 pieces of green apple with half cup shredded carrot and lot of lettuce with little walnut . no dressing  which I can use to eat, I asked the customer support and she was apologizing and said that she will take care next time . I asked her wat about now and how can I eat it? she wasnt bothered. Very very poor quality of food for the money we pay, never gonna use again and will not recommend"
"Recently from few of my friends I got to know about Swiggy site. So I downloaded swiggy app on my smart phone.  I was just amazed, as I live in Banjara Hills, and in other food partner sites like food panda and tasty khana, there is very less vegetarian hotel listed, but in this swiggy app there are total above 60 restaurants listed and in that there are many good pure vegetarian restaurants also listed. I saw, my most favorite restaurant of Hyderabad - Chutneys also there, first time Chutneys on online market. Yes, there limited quantity is little bit high - minimum order on Swiggy was 900 but good thing, Swiggy running promotional offer for their first time users.  So, I used 150 off code. I trusted Chutneys because of their food quality, taste, and neat and clean environment.  The service is from swiggy is really good, plus using app is much more easy than foodpanda app.  I like to use Swiggy app, they have mention everything clearly plus delivery time.  Site and app both are easy to use even by first time buyer.  The best part that I like in Swiggy app is at last just before payment, they ask if any extra request than can fill, as we are Jains, many of us do not eat Onions or some times here in south I have found much spicy food, so can fill their as request to make food less spicy, its really good.  Service at time and good staff."
"Had a pathetic experience using Swiggy not once but twice. First there was a problem with App which was not allowing to move the Marker on Maps. Spoke to Product Manager about the same. Second time problem with Placing the Order as they had technical glitches and they were not able to place order in the respective Restaurant I wanted my food from. After 1 hour I get to know through Delivery Boy again that the order was still not placed. This could be a case with me, however better to think twice before going to Swiggy"
"Just a couple of minutes back I ordered from a particular Restaurant through Swiggy, and instantly I get notifications about the order and also the delivery boys number with whom I can keep in touch with regarding my order. What I liked about it is that I could ask for something extra just in case I forget to order directly through the delivery boy which makes it easier for me and the delivery guy.  But I must say, the process it took for me to finally order my meal was a little confusing. There is a lot of confusion one goes through before he gets to where he ants to, sometimes some texts are misplaced and you cannot see some text, other people around me were having issues with signing up, these could probably be technical issues which I think Swiggy should work on.  It would really be great if wiggy could tie up with some more big brands like KFC or McDonalds etc. I'm sure then the number of requests they get will then significantly increase!  Here I am waiting for my order to come hopefully it comes within 45 minutes as they promised because I wouldn't want to come back and edit this review and turn it into a negative one.  All in all, my order has been almost hassle free, and I will most certainly order more from them in future."
"This is bring to your notice about the services of swiggy.com, I have placed a order yesterday(order no. 1042167070) and they failed to deliver the order even hours from the time request was raised. I followed up on my own and gave a call to the customer care department about the where about of my order.  Their was no cooperation from the the customer care department and without my consent my order was cancelled. I still am awaiting the money to be credited back to my account for the order placed.  This event has caused me to starve out for food even after paying for it in advance.This incident signifies the services and customer satisfaction which a individual can expect from swiggy.com."
We ordered via the app from a restaurant in the local area and paid via a mobile wallet.    No Order ID was generated.    No SMS for order confirmation was sent.    The order did show under Previous Orders under My Account    We  got to know about the cancelled orders after 2 hours via the Mobile wallet and NOT swiggy.    The Swiggy order ID was with the mobile wallet company but they couldnt send it to us.    The customer service is like few programmers explaining the code behind the app.    The customer service has no facility to resubmit the order and the customer has to re-order.    The customer service asks for screencaps from current customer to improve for new customer but does noting for the customer who complained.    No one from Swiggy.in has yet reverted my emails.      The app cannot handle basic functionality associated with a food ordering app.  This app is a complete scam and the only reason they are in existence to get the numbers and get funded.  Please avoid them if possible.
"I ordered through Swiggy yesterday from Ringview Restaurant, Hyderabad. After order confirmation( 7 30pm) I got a reply through sms in 30 mins that the order is ready to be picked up(now, 8 pm).  I was elated by this only to receive another sms in 2 mins that the order is cancelled since the delivery person could not reach me on mobile(while I am getting a barrage of sms es from them).  I called the customer care, who after 20 mins of deliberation said they will deliver the food(now, 8 20PM). I had a sigh of relief to have dinner finally arriving. The delivery guy arrived at 9 15 PM. I was starving and together with my cousin we put the stuff on plate and started having.  We found that instead of aloo paratha, there was masala kulcha. Since we were really hungry we thought Kulcha is fine.  Then we opened paneer curry and put on the plate. After a couple of bites with gravy we realized that the piece is not paneer and it is chicken(both of us are vegetarians). In another place, may be this might be interpreted as an order upgrade but we felt deeply offended.  Again called customer care and finally they brought the order at 10 30PM.(of course, it was cold and tasteless). You can imagine our frustration due to hunger and hurt sentiments."
"Swiggy provides a excellent door to door delivery service. I have tried many other apps such as tinyowl, foodpanda etc but the major difference is that other apps only act as a facilitator for placing orders and do not provide delivery of the orders.  Whereas in swiggy, the delivery is also made by their own fleet of delivery persons. also in other apps, the number of hotels is very limited and only high class hotels are available. but in swiggy, many small hotels are also available."
I ordered from swiggy at 8:45 pm and I waited more than an hour. Noone called and at 11:00 pm I got call that ur order is cancelled.  So never believe on swiggy and their ordering system.
"Ordered  almost more than 15 times from swiggy.Very good service. Its not correct to blame swiggy for the taste of food  .would highly recommend  it.  And also you can use the coupon SWIGGY75 to get 150 off on first order.Unlike other companies who attract customers by giving offers, Swiggy rather concentrates on Service."
"Swiggy app is a on-line food ordering app. App functionality is impressive. Swiggy app has there delivery boy who pick the food from the desired restaurant and deliver to us.  Last night I order a food(Fish meals) which cost is 100 rupees including 30 rupees of delivery charge form a Roy Hotel and restaurant. I got my food within half an hour. Fish meal consist of Rice, Daal, sabji, and two piece of fish.  Rice quality is good, but the quality if daal, fish gravy is worst. Gravy and daal is look like sambhar which consist of only water, its to much thicker. Even the fish piece is not fried well. My full mood is spoiled."
"Updated 20/07/2017- service of swiggy improved significantly 2 years back when swiggy started their service I was in bangalore but today I am in pune and swiggy service is improved significantly although some rule chnages in swiggy like minimum 250 rs order for free delivery otherwise 30 rs charges. now a days they are taking surcharges if rain is there and swiggy assured restaurants are there if you will not get delivery within time u will get 20% cashback, all though services of swiggy improved and I am happy of using swiggy.  Old Review:(23/04/2015)-Swiggy.com is new online food ordering website. through swiggy you can order food online from your favorite restaurant with minimum order condition but if your order is below 150 rs then you ave to pay 30 rs for delivery charges and if your order is above 150 then u will get free delivery.  In swiggy they have their own delivery executive who pickup your parcel from your favorite restaurant and deliver it to you. Their service is very irritating because when ever u check their website or app it always shows open in 30 minutes from now.  I was trying since last 3 days but it is showing same error message. Dont relay on this stupid website better to order from good website.  Very disappointed with swiggy."
"I recently order the food for 200 rupees in swiggy...even in corona period they follow accurate estimate time for food delivery.  It's nice to hear.  And only in swiggy there are many options available to pay through online as well as offline cash on delivery.  The Amazon pay option available only in swiggy I paid through Amazon pay balance.  Even though it was a corona pandemic , they follow as usual offers in their website...it's very nice for their follower..  And this pandemic their are many hotels are closed...  The delivery person also maintain social distancing. That person wear the mask and had cluse ..so it's safety for food  End this I enjoyed and tasted my food through swiggy"
