Review
We run a cloud Kitchen in Pune. We are on swiggy and Zomato for last 4 years+. Swiggy is running Ad and discount schemes without our permission and deducting our money for the same. I have stopped these Ads 4-5 times in last one month. I think they are in bad shape hence resorting to such low class acts for eating restaurant owners hard earned money.
"Why doesnt trustpilot have 0 stars for companies like swiggy. I ordered a red velvet for my niece's birthday which came completely broken and spoiled. The delivery guy acknowledged it and ran away leaving the cake with us, saying he is not responsible. I called the cake shop and they said they are not responsible either as the cake left fine from their shop. Now swiggy is saying the pictures i have provided are not clear enough for them to see if the cake is spoiled and broken. I would leave the image here if possible."
"Swiggy delivers stocked for long, stale or mostly heavily processed food, knowing it is harmful for people. Women are likely to suffer from menstrual cramps because of this kind of high on salt, sugar, carbs or stale food or food heavily processed with unwanted preservatives and chemicals. Women complain frequently of menstrual cramps or menstrual irregularities due to this kind of food. Yesterday, I ordered food from eatfit and they delivered burnt Alu fry with hard uncooked tomatoes in the rasam. Rice quality was better than other hotels, though. You must plan meals atleast 2 hours before..so that if one delivery goes wrong, the other goes right. Pray to God ."
"I'm using swiggy as they launched an app. Till Im using the same app for food and grocery. Last week I had booked an Alfaham from an Empire restaurant. The chicken was not cooked well. I have raised this concern to the support team. But, they won't resolve the issue till now. They are not professional. I won't promote this app anymore. Today itself I have removed all of my family members' devices. Don't go for this kind rubbish swiggy app. Really regret using this rubbish."
"Be careful with this app, I ordered dishes and did not receive the entire order and they said I was lying without any justification on their part, restaurants do what they want and you cannot receive your order and you will still pay...."
Don't order genie orders in swiggy.. My iteams got damaged
"Review:I had the worst experience with Swiggy! I ordered Chicken Biryani from Absolute Barbeque, but to my shock, I received sweets from Pulla Reddy instead. What an amazing experience (sarcasm)! This is completely unacceptable. Swiggy's customer support is useless and provides no real help. The whole system feels like a fraud, and there’s no accountability. I would strongly recommend NOT to order anything from Swiggy if you value your time and money. Terrible service!"
Order no. 195287529527892 dt. 8-1-25. I have not received the food items. This is mere technical glinch in swiggy website showing incorrect address even after mentioning landmark and location. Having come half of the way the delivery person stopped and argued with me saying why should he come.. The way he talked was really frustrating to me. Order was cancelled due to delivery person worst behaviour. Swiggy person cancelled the order. How can swiggy charge entire bill amount as cancellation fee without delivery. Does it make sense...? This is highly unacceptable and rediculous. I want the entire amount refund. Having sent mail till now no action taken.I will never order in swiggy anymore. Delivery person wont deliver the food and swiggy steals customer money for sure. Really worst experience i faced.
So i ordered items worth 2000 plus and I was delivered the wrong order. Not only did swiggy take forever to respond and did not even make efforts to contact the delivery guy and all they talk about is refund. Swiggy knows nothing about customer satisfaction l. Please check your orders before accepting. Swiggys reputation going down the drain. Time to switch to zomato permanently
"1. I placed an order on your platform for delivery to another person. The delivery address and contact details were correctly provided.2. The delivery agent called me, and I clarified that the order was for another individual, whose details were already mentioned. Despite this, the agent stated that the order was “not for you,” abruptly ended the call, and canceled the order.3. Following this, I contacted your support team to request either a refund or a reattempt at delivery. However, I was wrongfully held responsible for the issue, and my request was denied.This is unacceptable. Swiggy has failed to fulfill its obligation to deliver the product and has also refused to provide a refund, which constitutes a breach of consumer trust and rights."
"I ordered dinner from Swiggy at 9.9 pm and at 11.27 pm, they cancelled my order. In between, I called the delivery executive who did not respond to my calls and the restaurant said that it was ready for the food to be picked up since 9.30. Even their chatbot did not help effectively. After I posted about my ordeal on X, Swiggy offered me ₹100 as compensation for making me go hungry after 2.5 hours of waiting. No one should be insulted this way for being their customer for years. It only goes to show how much such companies invest into Customer Service vs Customer Acquisition. If this is how you are treated for their operational challenges, you might as well move to a different platform for business. Choose Another!"
"Fraudulent swiggyA company is scamming people with a new policy that doesn't allow refunds for orders that were never placed. It asked me to link an app (simple credit app), and as soon as I did, it said my order was placed successfully.Less quantityPromise for 15min delivery and delivered at 1 hour all the timeIn the name of coupon they extra charge example- 500 food paid 900If u want to go with an option of credit like simple app & it says to link the app as soon as u link it says order placed successfullyLOOTING people in the name of non refunds policyFood is being delivered non fresh or hotIdly is like rock stoneWorst packing ever"
"Interesting scam happened today, Swiggy delivery partner will reach your address won't call you but mention that the customer is not reachable and cancel the order. Swiggy then charges the complete order fee to customer. Once this is taken up with support - the support is slow and doesn't answer and then says that they can't reverse the cancellation fee because of food wastage and paying the dellivery partner. There is no resolution with support or Swiggy. Do not recommend using this app. Better off with using other food delivery apps. If there was a zero here I would have given that. Ruined new years present."
"Well, where do I even begin? This was nothing short of a disgraceful and outright SCAM. I registered on your platform using a UK phone number, which your system had no issues accepting. Everything seemed fine until I placed an order. Within less than two minutes, I decided to cancel, only to be told by your so-called ""agent"" that the cancellation charges were equivalent to the full order price. Unbelievable and outright extortionate!Now, here’s where it gets even worse. I explicitly mentioned the need to contact the number provided for ease of delivery—did that happen? Absolutely not. The order falsely shows as delivered when it clearly wasn’t. When I contacted your so-called customer service, they kept repeating the same nonsense about needing a ""valid"" phone number. I repeatedly explained that I am in the UK and registered with a UK number, yet your team had the audacity to claim they couldn't call international numbers.If your service cannot accommodate international numbers, then why on earth do you allow accounts to be registered internationally? Your entire system is a sham designed to trap customers into paying without delivering proper service.This is a 100% SCAM. I urge everyone to stay far away from Swiggy—it’s a nightmare in every sense.Stop exploiting customers and fix your broken system!"
I missed a call and immediately cancelled the order. Claiming that came to the location but I'm sure the claim was false.
"This is hands down the best vanilla ice cream youll ever taste. The flavor is absolutely divinenatural, rich, and oh so creamy. Its the perfect balance of sweetness and vanilla, without any artificial taste or overly sugary notes. The texture is luxuriously smooth, and it melts in your mouth effortlessly. Every spoonful is like a moment of pure happiness. Ive paired it with every type of dessert imaginablechocolate cake, brownies, fruit tartsand it elevates everything it touches. This ice cream is a masterpiece in simplicity and is truly the gold standard of vanilla. If you love vanilla ice cream, you absolutely need to try this."
The cancellation order policy is not user friendly. 100% cancellation fee applies on orders. I cancelled the payment and the app itself took the payment mode as cash on delivery and placed the order. I infact called the restaurant within 30’sconds to cancel the order and there was no cancel option in the app. Swiggy is not recommended.
"Fraud! Delivery person did not even pick up order from restaurant but cancelled it. I was charged the whole amount and did not receive any refund despite raising it with customer service multiple times. Sometimes they reply saying they’ll refund, sometimes they say no.. but I have not received any refund yet. They’re cheating customers and I’ll never order from Swiggy again. order no. #192190536612654"
Swiggy is good . on time deliveries . but the most dissapointing this happened for the first time is that my order did not come only and it was showing as delivered. Should start and OtP System for this also
Delivery person did not deliver food. The order was cancelled by Swiggy and I was charged the whole amount without receiving anything. App is also glitchy and customer service is non existent and nefarious. Pretty sure the delivery person uses Swiggy as a free meal at the cost of real customers. Highly fraudulent practices. Users be warned.
"Worst services, fake timing. Stupid executive if help is needed."
They messed up our party order with unprofessional behavior and responses and spoilt our entire party Kindly do not give party orders on Swiggy They took full money and 0 responsibility of the same . Delayed delivery of over 2 & a half hours Cold food miss managed and no response Very unprofessional
Unresponsible app ye log shop closed hone ke baad bhi order aur payment received kr lete h aur baad chutiya bnate h so this aap are very baad
"I am extremely disappointed with Swiggy's service. Despite providing my address clearly, they delivered my order to a completely different location, not once, but twice! This shows a severe lack of attention to detail and accountability on their part.To make matters worse, they forcefully canceled my order without my consent and did not issue a refund. This is completely unacceptable and highlights their lack of concern for customer satisfaction.I strongly advise others not to blindly trust Swiggy. If such mistakes can happen to me multiple times, it could easily happen to anyone. Think twice before ordering..you might end up regretting it."
I ordered via Swiggy 10 rasmalai and 10 rasagullaOut of 10 rasagulla only 2 were white which we ordered and rest were brown - probably jaggery - which tasted awful. Complain to Swiggy resulted in no service - even on phone. Very very disappointing. Kanti sweets should not cheatThey should have declined the order and refunded money - instead they sent a different product which we did not order or want or could eat! Still looking for a refund of 320 rupees. I will definitely not order from this Kanti sweets and also move away from Swiggy to Zomato.
"I am happy with the cost effectiveness here. Offers are available mostly all days,never got dissatisfied with the service though sometimes the delay happen like 2-3 times out of 100s that's manageable.I suggest you to add onto the food court in the options as well as cloud kitchens instead of giving preference to only fancy centric foods because mostly the picture does not look like the product I get delivered."
"Stuck in a Time Loop!At 7:13, I was told my order would arrive in 16 minutes (7:29). By 7:27, the app updated and said it would take 11 more minutes, pushing the delivery to 7:38. Now it’s 7:31, and it still says 11 minutes!It feels like the app is messing with time itself—no matter how many minutes pass, the ETA doesn't change. This constant shifting and inaccurate time prediction is incredibly frustrating. Please improve your tracking and provide realistic estimates. (One star for this endless waiting game.)"
"Swiggy is a fraudulent app who delivers expired/near expiry products and then never accept it's mistake and never make a refund. My orderid was order  Id 192109828366170 of Dec5,2024 and I spite of complaining to customer support,grievance officer and it's ceo,they never turned up. Plz stop using swiggy and instead use Amazon,Flipkart,BBasket which has customer friendly support system."
"Worst company, I ordered some snacks with correct address and phone number. When delivery boy reached the location, we gave immediate approval too still Swiggy cancelled the order saying we did not respond to calls. My product Worth Rs.1926 got cancelled and no refund for this. This is company's fraud. We should ban such nonsensical policies and companies! And customer service is so worthless inspite of attaching all the proofs they are still not ready to resolve the issue."
"""DO NOT TRUST SWIGGY!I am beyond frustrated with Swiggy. This isn't just a one-time issue—I've had multiple experiences where Swiggy took my money, never delivered my order, and ignored my calls. Every time, the delivery driver refuses to pick up or respond, and then the order just disappears. It's like they take your money and vanish. I genuinely feel cheated, and it’s happened far too often for it to be a coincidence. Swiggy has proven they can't be trusted, and it's nothing short of fraud. Don’t make the mistake I did—avoid Swiggy at all costs. There are plenty of reliable alternatives out there!"""
"3 times all items were not delivered even after full payment.1st time ordered 250gm Jalebi and 250gm Dhokla gave 100-100gms only. I thought some mistake from my side so not took follow-up.2nd Time ordered 1kg dhokala delivery boy gave 500gm only then I called delivery boy he told me to call restaurant from where I have ordered on Swiggy. No one replied then I went to that restaurant and they he accepted mistake.3rd time on Saturday 7th Dec 2024, there was party at home and ordered some Sweets and Rabadi and Rabadi was missing in the order. called both delivery boy no answer then called Sweet junction they told this is happed 4 time with us will check with Swiggy and Delivery boy and will give you refund.After complain no one has refunded and delivered Rabadi yet.Not expected this kind of service from Swiggy because always customer is facing issue."
Worst experience.I Ordered at 8pmNo call answering by delivery person as well restaurant after trying for many times.No direct cx care / call center number. So can't reach them directly.Got computerised call for unable to deliver your order. And came to know that they will.refund amount. That to arount 10 pm.Worst experience.
"I ordered 2 months ago through the iOS app. I placed the order by paying through the app itself and it's delivered. However, I noticed the item I ordered with quantity 2 delivered just 1. I reported through their app and a standard reply came which doesn't take any ownership or proper customer support. I contacted multiple people and they said they can't help with it. In short, Swiggy simply took the money :D I think these people should learn from ""Deliveroo"" or ""Just Eat"" how they run business."
Cheating people money. I ordered for food with exact address location but finally got cancelled saying could not locate us. 5 minutes prior to that order another delivery partner delivered from same swiggy. Delivery partner cheated delivering the food and swiggy management denied to refund for no fault of us. We did nit receive food and money as well. Be careful with swiggy orders as they don't take any responsibility for something worst happens
"Pathetic app. The agents are never ob time. They are busy delivering orders from other apps. Food delivery is always delayed, customer agents will not help with cancelation infact they will also not let you rate them. One agent mentioned they were trained to keep customer ls on long hold in the meantime push agent to deliver faster. I ordered from a QSR restaurant 5 mins from my place, the order was delayed by more than 30 mins, items were missing, food was cold."
"Very bad experience. I had ordered for from RNR, Jayanagar and it did not reach me even after waiting for 2 hours. The customer service executive told she will cancel the order and give me full refund. But after few minutes I got the refund with 85 Rs deduction. I have been following up through email and customer support, but they are not ready to refund the balance amount. I did not get the food but only lost 85 Rs to these fraud company called swiggy"
Swiggy is just a fraud company. They cancelled the order saying delivery agent couldn't reach us where in instructions I provided them two other numbers. When I complaint to customer service they are not ready to listen anything. Keep away from this fraud company.
"I'm so annoyed at this company I have a bad experience anytime I decide to order anything from here. They deliver your order to the current location instead of the address specified on the delivery. If a person is travelling and decides to turn the location off are they gonna deliver the order on the road. It doesn't make sense at all. When the customer puts in the address why use the current location. I tried explaining the person who contacted me but instead of helping ne out the order got cancelled and I am liable to pay the cancellation fee. Henceforth, I'm never using this app ever."
"I placed an order on Swiggy today with the order ID 191507276939954. However, the delivery agent committed fraud with me. The agent refused to deliver my order and cancelled it on my behalf without my consent. As a result, I neither received my order nor a refund.I also contacted swiggy customer care, but they were unable to assist me. Initially, they assured me that the amount would be refunded, but when I checked the Swiggy order status, the entire amount was deducted as cancellation fees. However, I did not cancel the order myself. This fraud was committed by the delivery agent. As per discussion with delivery partner he was hungry and he ate my order and thats the reason not to deliver. So please take hard action against them.Therefore, I request you to take strict action against the swiggy and delivery agent and refund my amount. This fraud occurred due to negligence on Swiggy's part.Sincerely,Preeti Jain"""
"Wrost and pathetic I talked with Mr Suman on call from Swiggy gave me unresponsive reply.Delivery partner wants to order twice in that location and taking time longer and also fooling us with that sir gadi puncture hai,Mumbai rat ke 11:30baje rat me gadi puncture hui aur repair bhi karva raha hai jab ki iss time me koi shop open nahi hai repair ke liye.Unauthentic and bad service provider.You lost our trust Swiggy"
Do not use this app and services. For any issues including food safety issues they have scripted responses to contact restaurant and they have no control on restaurants. They are only available to take their commission and charge extra to deliver with no responsibilities. Swiggy is risk to society and people's health and safety
"This is the 2nd time swiggy delivery guy attempted a theft and swiggy customer care doesnt do anything.I waited for my delivery 2 hours and when you check the status in the app. you would see the food is delivered.if you ask any quesyion to dheeraj koli, constantly lying about everything.if you ask why did you click on delivered, he would say my phone did it automatically.you would ask you should have called customer, restaurant amd swiggy support he would say i dont have number of anyone. imagine how did he get all the orders. They have an app where they recieve every information about work.when i called customer care she would believe every single word of delivery guy without using her brain.now when you ask him to give me order, his first reply woulf be i have to go back to restaurant and give it to you. then he would say wjere is my order that you brought previously, he would say it is in my hand.  then he would say i can deliver it now.i waited for 1 hour more and yes, it is confirmed he has stolen my food. and swiggy support team wont remove this guy."
Don't order food from this app support team was very worst and very rude behaviour.there is iteams are missing what i ordered there is no replacement at late night I ordered food I was very hungry.i think compare swiggy Zomato is good service and good support from support team.
"On 25th Oct 2024, I placed an order of Ice cream from Swiggy for my mother’s birthday. Swiggy delivery partner claimed that he called me, which I never received. So, he did not deliver the order of 800 rupees. And now Swiggy is not refunding the amount, stating it was my mistake as their delivery partner could not find my house, where other delivery agents have and had delivered food and other parcels easily. If he couldn’t get through my number, he could have asked for the address from anyone, they would have guided him. 	Par logon ko time pe khaana khilaane waale mere 800 rupaye khaanaa chahatein hai. They have ruined my birthday surprise and also ruined the trust, which I have shown in Swiggy. Thanks to you, I am switching to Zomato."
"Worst experience from delivery person Mr.Ramesh Rajan, Threatened us for cancelling the paid order as he got delayed to deliver it. Used bad words and quarelled with us before delivering the food. Swiggy being the worst delivery platform now a days. Zomato is comparatively much much better in service. We are abandoning swiggy and sharing the same bad experience with all friends and family."
"Dear Swiggy Team,I placed order, which has not been delivered to me. Despite speaking with the delivery boy, he claimed to have left the order at the gate without handing it over to anyone. We have CCTV footage proving that no one approached our gate during the delivery time.Refer the below details of delivery boyName - SujalContact no - 08904909673I have also sent an email regarding this issue but have not received any response yet. The order was of a substantial amount,  I have sent multiple reminders for the same but no one contact with us."
I had ordered a cake from book my cake and I ordered for something and got a total different item. That is aside and when we had to eat the cake it was spoiled cake.while this is happening I raised an issue at swiggy the answer that I got is you will get a response after 24 hours drop a mail so I order food from you I get the worst product and you guy tell me that I need to wait like I need to keep this spoiler cake and wait for your response until 24 hours. This is disappointing and also you guy need to give faster resolution
"ORDER #169314724386738 made through Swiggy today Mar 13, 2024. Exper and ienced worst package and service issues (1)Ice cream melted for atleast 4 cups (2) one cup missing (3) one cup spilled in nitrogen ice making it unfit to consume. Swiggy simply passed on the bug on vendor declined to refund and there after giving free advice to write review on vendor"
"Pls don't order from swiggy instamart, they are not trustworthy people. I order few items, one of my item wa missing. I talk to them on help option, even after three days they didn't refund my money or deliver the missing item, then i email them and they deny to refund my money. Zepto and blinkit are much better then them they process the refund within an hrs, so i request pls dont order from swiggy intamart"
There is no any phone number to contact swiggy if l place order . delivery reached near my home after l got message 9 minutes order is cancelled if not contact . called restaurant but they also have no contact number to delivery boy . swiggy manager said he is third party he can't help . A customer have no access to contact anyone by phone  in company . but they take 925 rupee cancellation fee . very disappointed . order to restaurant not use this app
"I placed the order at 3:55, And Swiggy delivery time was 25 mins. I checked after 25 mins and the delivery time is increased to 35 more minutes. So basically I am receiving my food after an hour from ordering. So, I raised a conversation as where is my order and talked to Customer care representative. They told me that there is some problem with delivery partners vehicle. 1. Isn’t Swiggy checking that the time is increasing ? And provide me another Delivery person ?2. I told her to cancel the order since it is showing 35 more minutes. To which she replied that I have to pay cancellation fee.So I have to pay for Swiggy’s fault.Swiggy is showing delivery in 25 mins, Not being able to deliver on the time they provide. And I have to pay for it ?If It would have me shown me an hour at the beginning I would have ordered from somewhere else.Also I contacted restaurant they said the food is prepared from last 10 mins. So I should accept the food which was prepared 45 mins ago ? Isn’t it gonna get cold ?Worst experience from Swiggy."
"Fraudulent company with no ethics. They rob people of their money, don't deliver food at the right address, and then cancel the order, and don't provide a refund. I don't know how the owner eats and sleeps at night. He will pay for this."
We ordered food for train which was at 7pm from ahemdabaad. But delivery boy was unable to reach at time and they want us to bear 100% cancellation charges. Though it was completely there mistake and the response was not good we had to pay cancellation charges as they were calling Continuously.  मतलब सीधा सीधा है कि फुड डिलीवर करने पर समय से पहुच नही रहे जैसे स्टेशन मे ट्रेन उनके लिए खड़ी रहेगी और वो फोन भी नही कर रहे लेकिन ट्रेन चलने पर जब ऑर्डर कैंसिल कर रहे है तो लगातार मैसेज और फोन कर रहे है।So please कोई bhi order hi mat karo swiggy se...Rating Star maang rahe the isliye 1 star diya nhi to wo bhi nhi
"I ordered Vegetarian food from Restaurant, but received Non Veg Item. When raised complaint to Swiggy, they didn’t even replace nor refunded the paid amount. They suggested to rate the Restaurant, what’s the use in rating when I didn’t get what I ordered. Very horrible experience. Also I am One Lite Member of Swiggy, waste of money."
I got one of the worst service on swiggy. I don't think so they are thinking about the frauds.  I was ordered chicken biryani from kamakshi restaurant goa . Their delivery partner called me and tell .e he reached on the location but he is not there when i was told him I am not able to see you he disconnected my call nd then I got a call from customer service that she was cancelled my order and charge panlty to me . They are really surprising people.  I don't think so how they cancel order by themselves and charge panlty .
"Hello All, I have ordered 3255 worth sweets from swiggy, delivery agent make a big fraud with me, after speaking with him, he didn't lift my calls, they cancelled my order. After reaching to swiggy they are telling me they can't do anything. This is the fraud they are making with people. Please don't make any orders from swiggy. Worst experience..Waste swiggy they are not listening to customers."
"It was very bad experience with the swiggy as I ordered the decorative lights to light up my house and order get placed properly on prepaid basis. Later on I got the call as the order was getting delay so they gave me 2 option 1 was to wait for order or 2nd was to cancel the order where i had clearly selected the 1 option. After disconnection of call I got the message that my order has been cancelled. For the same when I connect on chat box the female staff was unable to solve my issue. When I asked here to place the same order, she mentioned that she can not place the order at their end. It's really pathetic that swiggy can not place an order for the customer but can cancel the order without the customer permission."
I ordered BUY 1 GET ONE FREE and my mom also ordered at the same time as we were ordering from different restaurants. Complete fake they gave us one but not another one for free swiggy is the worst there is not proper line of communication between us and them worst food delivery service. On top of that the food delivery boy didn't even care he just said bhai please give a good review....sheeesh such audacity from this company its just horrible.
"I order food often via swiggy. As per their suggestion i took membership for 3 months of Swiggy One by paying the fee offering free delivery. Now they are taking fee for each delivery saying ""free delivery is not applicable for this hotel"". True for all hotels. Big cheaters. So be careful while ordering."
"Worst experience, I did not expect this from Swiggy instamart one item was missing from my previous oredr which cost 1500rs but no one is responding even I sent a somuch mails and calls there is no response. It’s a fake website . Please don’t believe this type of websites ."
"Swiggy is fraud company ""Today, I had the worst experience with Swiggy. When I ordered my food, the delivery partner did not answer my calls. It was his responsibility to contact me, but he didn’t call me even once. After I raised the issue on chat, the delivery partner finally answered and gave me another location. When I reached there, he was busy on another call. I waited for more than half an hour, and he still didn’t answer my continuous calls. When I raised the same issue on chat again, they said a senior team member would speak to me, but the senior team member directly blocked me. What kind of third-class service are they providing"
"Such a liar, and this company is not right for the business at all. How is this company running in India and having customers? They are taking a huge amount from the customer's pocket like fraudsters and do not have the courtesy to explain why they are keeping a 100% cancellation charge? There is no customer care and no response to emails. I suggest to abondon this company service at any cost."
Recently I was ordering some food in Swiggy suddenly I have cross checked the price in Zomoto I was shocked the price is very high for the same restaurant Zomoto seems lesser price when u r ordering double check
I have a very bad experience with swiggy delivery If i order food for breakfast they are delivering for lunch They have a serious issue with the map where there delivery guys are confused to delver on timeOther food delivery company are able to deliver on time but this swiggy not able toHence i have given feed back to the customer support and un installed the appSwiggy team ur lossing a valuable customer i was ordering the food for long long timeThanks for the bitter support and service
"Worst experience with swiggy team.Unprofessional, delays in delivery, robotic behaviour of delivery team, partners. We ordered food yesterday night from Hatari but swiggy team just fail to deliver the order on time. When I ordered dinner from another restaurant then my payment process got failed I couldn't place the order 😔. Suddenly after few minutes the app people called me and told that your order has been delivered when I failed to place my order. When I cancelled the order they created caos and claimed cancellation fees. We had to face harassment, embarassment infront of our guests. Such disgusting unacceptable behaviour ❌😡"
"I ordered sandwich I found I live 🐛 worm inside the sandwich, then I reported to the customer care and they say sorry we can't initiate any refund on this and they closed the chat. I don't understand how irresponsible do this big company can be. Never to buy anything from this site."
"ordered food through Swiggy. However, the delivery partner did not reach my location and refused to deliver the food. He was very rude while I was talking to him. Is this the way to talk to a customer? The customer care was also helpless and blamed me for providing an incorrect location. Additionally, they canceled my order without my permission. Is this some kind of trick? I have never experienced such a terrible situation before..worst swiggy..fake app.."
Order #83987810495563I have placed order from Siggy and the guy who did not deliver the food at my home and they have cancelled my order without initmating me and they are now denying my refund... this shows the rude attitude of delivery boy and swiggy
"Everytime on placing an order it takes more than an hour. Swiggy doesn’t even provide their employees proper transportation and they use bicycle, be it that the food turns cold and your need gets over. Pathetic, guys please switch to other food delivery apps"
"Swiggy scam ⚠️ I ordered food through Swiggy. However, the delivery partner did not reach my location and refused to deliver the food. He was very rude while I was talking to him. Is this the way to talk to a customer? The customer care was also helpless and blamed me for providing an incorrect location. Additionally, they canceled my order without my permission.

"Swiggy’s Absolute Worst Delivery Experience – A Masterclass in Horrible Customer ServiceIf I could give Swiggy negative stars, I absolutely would. What unfolded last night was nothing short of a disaster—an absolute mockery of what a “world-class delivery service” should be. Swiggy, with all its marketing gimmicks and tall claims about seamless food delivery, has officially hit rock bottom in customer service, empathy, and basic accountability.We placed an order at 10 PM, expecting a reasonable delivery time. But instead, the Swiggy delivery person decided to take a scenic tour of Bangalore, roaming around Sarjapur Road like he was on a midnight joyride, before inexplicably heading off to Electronic City—miles away from our location. The incompetence was laughable, if not outright infuriating.When we reached out to Swiggy’s so-called customer support, hoping for some clarity and resolution, we were fed empty assurances and blatant lies— “The order will be delivered in some time.” Oh really? Another 30 minutes passed, and yet, the delivery guy was still showing in Electronic City. What was he doing there? Having a picnic? Running his own errands? Because at this point, it was clear Swiggy had no control over their own delivery personnel.And what did Swiggy do when we asked for cancellation and compensation for this outrageous delay and sheer negligence? Nothing. Absolutely nothing—except offering a measly ₹46 as some pathetic excuse for compensation. ₹46 for an order that was supposed to arrive in minutes but never came. ₹46 for a child who ordered food, kept waiting hungrily, only to fall asleep disappointed and empty-stomached. ₹46 for wasting over an hour and a half of our time.This is beyond atrocious customer service—it is utter disregard for customers, their time, and their basic expectations. If Swiggy cannot ensure timely deliveries, handle issues responsibly, or even offer meaningful compensation when they screw up this badly, then they have no business running a food delivery service at all.Their blatant lack of accountability, absolute disregard for customer inconvenience, and the sheer audacity to refuse meaningful compensation for their own failure is nothing short of appalling. Swiggy is a shining example of everything that is wrong with customer service today—big promises in ads but zero actual care for real customers when they need support.If you care about timely food delivery, responsible customer service, and not being blatantly cheated, then AVOID SWIGGY AT ALL COSTS.Swiggy, shut down your business if you can’t even do the basics right."
"Worst company, Zero customer care. Recently i placed an order for food , the delivery time at the time of order was shown as 40 min , after kept me waiting for 1:30 hrs they cancelled the order giving reason that they have technical issue in arranging delivery boy. Very bad experience, this app deserves dustbin only."
"Request Received - Order #175764620019545 | May 27, 2024 | 01 : 39 PMPrevious week placed order for Dominos Pizza using this useless Swiggy app, they cancelled the order without informing and I'm yet to receive a refund. 4days ago have sent them email requesting refund status update got a reply stating they will investigate and respond within 24hrs, it's been over 72hrs since I'm waiting for their reply and refund update. I must say they don't have respect for customer, worst customer service ever received from a company. Shambolic. For a second if you feel ashamed of yourself at least respond to my email with an update. Very unhappy customer. Many ThanksAngel"
"I received my order in 2 hours, when I call customer care number the executive is too rude and she doesn't have manners to talk to the customer.She was talking to the executive as if we were calling them to harass them.I received the order in 2 hours but it was not in eating condition because it had become completely cold. And the customer care executive was ready to listen to it."
Third class. Very Dangerous. They compromise the health of the customers. They have tied up with cheap and dangerous food vendors like Kerala Restaurant who supply stalled food. Trying to make money through all cheap way. Pathetic. Be aware.
Pathetic service. I ordered 2 KFC Zinger meals with large popcorn paying 1300. What I get is 2 small burgers and a popcorn. Horrible service. When i call customer care they took so much time to understand the situation and just apologize and say we will give u coupon of 195. Horrible thing.please think twice before ordering from Swiggy.
"I got my order less, SWIGGY could not resolve it"
I ordered few vegetables and fruits yesterday and they were all rotten even the expensive apples were rotten inside and plum too.The tomatoes were not in a eatable condition.I would give 0 starts if it was possible.NEVER ORDER VEGETABLES AND FRUITS FROM SWIGGY!
I have ordered Pedigree in swiggy but opened that packet after 4 days of order received. I can see warms in Pedigree and also manufacture date of Pedigree is 22/08/23 and expiry is 16/08/24. I contacted customer support but they are not ready to give the refund. They stated We would like to inform you that refunds or replacements for queries raised after 96  hours from the order delivered cannot be issued.This is not done. Please don't buy anything from swiggy Instamart. The cost of Pedigree is Rupees 1116
"Today we ordered veg paneer (Biryani by kilo) and while eating we got something which is not veg. Then when we check we assume that , it's chicken piece. We spoke to the biryani by kilo and they responded with sorry and they asked us to raise a complaint in swiggy. Avoid online food order and goto restaurant by your choice and enjoy food in their promises."
"Extorted my full money 1785 ruppees for cancellation. I had a terrible experience from them. They cancelled by Diwali order for my family and charged full amount 1785 ruppees as cancellation. They did not help at all during my call. They return the order to the restaurant paying them nothing and keeps all the money to themselves. Looks like with new festive platform fees, they are resorting to extorting money just because you placed an order from them and keeping the money to themselves and not providing any service to the customer and even not paying the restaurant. That’s the way to go become a profitable company before the IPO.Proud of seeing the new revolutionary companies becoming profitable by extorting money from the common man. Rich becomes richer and common man just loses their hard earned money. Fabulous going to becoming a great(we know the reality) nation."
"They are robbers. I ordered 4 lava cakes from Hira sweets through swiggy on 14 Feb 2024. Delivery boy Talib was assigned to deliver my order. I keep on waiting for my order for 50 mins, but I didn't receive my order. When I check it showed that the order is delivered. When I complaint about it on their customers support through email for my refund, they refused to refund my money back by saying that your order is delivered without doing any investigation. It eans their management team and delivery boy are partners in this robbery."
"Today I have ordered one cake and 2 chicken 65 from Mio-Amore Bally. When we received the order, one chicken 65 was missing and the conditioner of the cake was horrible, it fully messed.Please send me the cake and chicken 65 again. Today is my mother-in-law’s birthday and you people ruined the surprise the treat. I am really disappointed about the service and the quality of the food was delivered."
"signed up for Swiggy with an International card and phone number.  They were quick to charge the card, but then delivery never happened, and just as a warning- They do not support International phone numbers....!!!!"
Maine order Kiya payment Kiya  mujhe refund milane wala tha 24 hours ho gye koi refund nahi aya. Koi toll free no.nahi hai wrist experience raha . 😡😡😡😡😡 Pls. Do not order food this aap/site very bad service. Ha agar apko dan puny karana ho to  in logo ko kar sakate ho.
Hi team this is regarding my swiggy order #182617473157127.The order was paid and wa waited for 1 and half hours .We even confirmed with the restaurant and they said the delivery person has left.We tried to call the delivery person but he did not pick up the call.Finally you cancelled the order and refunded the money.My question is why the hell then the app showed delivery is in progress .This misguided us and we starved almost for 1.5 hours .Very disappointing from swiggy .I will not recommend swiggy to anyone and will not use swiggy hereafter.
"Fraud company. Poor customer service. No use of it. They didn't give me refund for undelivered products from swiggy's instamart. The customer support is just to convince you, it's not the real support. It says the same thing, like ai. Even emails are like that. Didn't give any compensation for late delivery."
I ordered but one get one meal But I received only one when I complaint in customer care then then they told me this coupon is not applied This is a fake and scammer Don't order with themZomato is a realistic and faithful Swiggy people a big scammer and scamming a people and theif our hard earn money Now onwords i unstiall this for forever
Krdasharathi Kadambi@krdasharathiBad intentionI placed an order online on swiggy Mart Bangalore a week ago for two items worth Rs 316 but after sometime I got a call from the delivery person that for your address I cannot deliver the same. I live in tatanagar Bangalore near hebbal and location/ address was available in my online account and chosen correctly. When I spoke to the store persons they said your order is cancelled and there is no refund of any money. I wrote e-mails to swiggy customer who wanted order no etc. I looked for the order no on my online account but found nothing they had erased everything therefore I gave them the time and items ordered with screenshot of location and address but there was no reply. I have a debit card tranfer to swiggy from my bank acct.Therefore I escalated my query for refund to the highest consumer care executive but no reply has been received till today. I therefore conclude that this company is deceptive and indulges in acts of moral turpitude and doesn’t mind cheating it’s customer. I advise any purchaser online to keep away from buying from them as they don’t have the least regard to their customers. I am not in a position to recover my hard earned money as the expenses will overtake the amt to be recovered. But I look forward for some customer to teach a lesson to such crooksDasharathi KRSr cit/retd jt dir CPRl bng
Spoiled food is supplied from a road side stall while we ordered it from a restaurant. Hopeless help centre. Full cheating. They close our complaints without even verifying. Fake resolution system. It appears to me they are a fraud.
"have ordered two havmor cone icecream, however I have lotte brand cone icecream which was average in taste.I have already complained about this to their support team along with the invoice. But, they are not accepting their mistake and claiming that it was the same one. This behaviour is very unacceptable and I need a clarification for this."
"I was in office and ordered food for kids at home. Inspite of paying full online, the delivery guys came and took away  1200 rs. from kids saying this is a COD delivery as it was delayed. The issues is kids were alone at home that time. He could have looted more money or harm the kids any other way. Super safety concern. When I chatted with Customer service- they were pathetic."
"I’d like to raise a concern about a recent issue with my McDonald's order via Swiggy. Despite having my correct delivery address saved for years, the delivery partner refused to deliver, claiming the location showed up in a river. I assured them the address was accurate and had not changed, there must be a technical glitch from your end but instead of resolving the issue, the delivery partner refused to deliver at my location and asked me to cancel the order. I found his response rude and unprofessional. When I contacted Swiggy support, they inaccurately claimed I canceled the order which is not ture. This needs to be addressed."
"Waste order from swiggy, it's been one hour ordered and still not getting food, hotel is not reciving the call and delivery boy is helpless, fkers swiggybis bothered about hunger. Waste don't order from swiggy."
I am boycotting swiggy. Swiggy is a no 1 Thief in broad daylight. There is a very hige difference in the price displayed in Swiggy App and in the actual restaurant's original menu. Shameless thieves. How can you spike the price of the dish and charge for your service on top of it. You make a profit of more than 50% on the food that you are only delivering and not cooking it yourself. What values are you all made of ??? You make money by cheating your customers when they order food. Cheapos.
"When things go wrong, Swiggy customer service sucks. They just do postmen job. Zomato agents are much better equipped to handle escalations. Have stopped ordering on Swiggy."
Swiggy order no. #164015100583984Incorrect location  taken by APP in MumbaiSweet box was never delivered Swiggy forced to cancel and advised will refundNo action taken despite many requests
"Fradulant activity experienced. It cheated me today  cancelling my paid order and grabbed my money as cancellation fees. I was typing correct address repeatedly, but website not accepting and propping wrong address. Worst experience. I was not abled to speak to the concerned person. No direct contact"
"I ordered 2 items and 1 item was missing when delivered. I got a refund of Rs.635. but when I reordered, the same item I was billed Rs.706. I think swiggy is doing this with their knowledge to get more money from us. The refund should be in such a way I order the same item without paying any extra. There is no option to reorder and only refund was the option provided. This is similar to looting if swiggy platform is doing such things with their knowledge"
"When I ordered l, the delivery time was 6 minutes. After 10 to 12 minutes, the status on the app showed Driver is at your location.When I out to receive my delivery, the delivery was obviously not there and when I called him, for the next 5 minutes he just kept repeating I'm at the location, without disclosing to me any near by addresses so that I could guide him.I called Customer Care for assistance and after spending more than 10 minutes over the call, I got a response the beat we can do is cancel your order and refund the amount.So basicall, I wasted more than 30 minutes on something, I should have received in 6 minutes as per the initial promise and the irony is I did not even receive the itemThat's the best service they can provide"
"Guys, i normally dont write negative reviews, but swiggy has just crossed the limits. i placed an order for INR 1750/-. from my home putting the correct address with swiggy for the 1st time. the delivery guy just called and said that i have given the wrong address and will not be able to deliver as he cannot spend more money on fuel. Swiggy backend team calls back and said they have cancelled the order and will not be refunding my money as they were tracking through live location. i have tried to reason with them by saying i have ordered while i am at home so my live location should be my home address. I have manually put the address in the app. so how is that the address is different. Swiggy was not able to answer my queries nor they were able to resolve the problem. I just lost INR 1700."
"Of late, Swiggy has become less customer-centric. Yes, It appears that customer's ordeal is not properly understood by them. Because, going by the tone of their response, when I informed the customer support by mail that one of the items was missing on delivering the ordered items, it appears that you feel satisfied (of justice having been done) just by crediting back the amount meant for missing item. No word of regret even for your deficiency in service though the charges are collected for the same. You are NOT suitably compensating (like offering the earlier ordered items free when ordered next time) for the ordeal undergone by the customer as the customer is not serviced properly (has to forego his dinner) and made to spend more time, for no fault of him, in writing mail, trying to contact you etc., (no customer care number also!) Initiating the process of crediting back  the value of the missing item (as per their mail) is the only positive! Earlier (June'24) also, I had a similar experience wherein instead of the ordered Kaldosa, Idly was supplied!"
I ordered food by using swiggy app. After one and half hour the order was not delivered and neither restaurant nor the rider whose number was shared on the app picked the phone callI had to cancelled my order . I mailed to customer care so that some action should be taken against restaurant or rider.But they simply reply with the routine mail that we are sorry.This is really ridiculous and frustrating
"Unethical business practices. I accidently placed an order (was supposed to be placed for later) while adding items to the cart for placing the order later. I instantly went to the order to cancel and the AI said I cannot cancel because they only allow 1 minute cancellation. I have screenshots of order time (5:16 PM) and cancellation request (5:17 PM) and AI message that I cannot cancel (5:17 PM). I instantly called customer service and there it felt like breaking my head when I tried to explain that their system is at fault. The customer service agent kept repeating the same message - sorry sir the order can only be cancelled within 1 minute without answering my question about why I could not cancel within 1 minute in line with the policy. Absolute crooks! When companies make money their priority over ethics, that is when the downfall begins.Sriharsha Majety - I hope you know what's going on."
Very bad service delivery boy cancelled order without initmation so this Swiggy will lose 50 customers at time Thanks
"pathetic partner support, a big cheat, never respond to support, keep on writing mails and calling them, useless team, only know how to foola and make money. they should be bycotted , it is a discrace in the food delivery  platform"
Don't order from swiggyIt's  food quality is very rubbish from so many days there using the same oil and it is very bad don't order I vomitted very badly after eating that 🤮😡 Nonsense Only u all know how to take money And give useless horrible 🤮 food Which does not have any taste chii vomit on your food qualitys
I had placed any order with swiggy for one butter chicken and mixed fried rice and the shocking part is that instead of getting my order they gave someone else order with was the same but veg. I am sure they vegetarian have become non vegetarian that night thanks to swiggy delivery person for not double checking the order list. They 1st agreed for a refund partially. Now I get a reply email saying that they cannot refund me as the issue was with the restaurant and I should give them a bad review so they can improve. The app is theirs they make upto 70 percent profit on all deals and when it's our money and the food is wrong the customer is to be blamed. I am sad that the strands of swiggy has dropped so so low. Request Received - order issue (Items are missing from my order) for order #172074560826066
"If there was a negative score, I would have given that. After one and a half hour, my order was not delivered. If you speak with the customer reps , they say the same crap they were trained to say. They used to be really good but not anymore. Terrible experience with swiggy. Not once but multiple times. Same crap different day."
"Hi Penchol,Thank you for writing to us about order #160381163261138.Enough care is taken by the restaurant to ensure quality. It is unfortunate that your order did not meet your expectations.

"I have ordered Three items at 0802hrs and they promised to deliver in 35 minutes. After 35 minutes I contacted Restaurant Anna Dosa , they told me that they have not received order. After some time I received a call from Swiggy that my order is on way. I received one item short after 1 hour that is 0902hours."
I have ordered food which was delivered in one and half hour...i have ordered pizza which came like deep freezed...food quality was not good might be expired product they are using(PizzaHut)...when i called swiggy executive they were not even allowing me to talk to there senior authoity and they were so rude....food was saugy and chilled...i had to throw all the items ordered...i need a complete action on my review and response...
I have ordered at 8:59 pm after after 1 min I have cancelled the order so why the swiggy charges me for this and which food is ready with in 1 min and the customer service said this is your fault
I ordered for a pre paid order and their executive is not responding and when I called to that person he said that hotel is preparing  your order after one hour he was responding same. Swiggy donot have their customer care presence. They only wants to make money. And their people are also fearless that he is blaming me for order. Was that my restaurant? I forced them. They took money in advance from me and still he abused me. I paid the money in advance in accordance to their services but please belive me they will not listen you. Their people are not taking taking calls still they will blaim you. Then why they are accepting your orders
"Everything in Swiggy seems to be wrong, as there is no customer care number for the customers to report any fraudulent transactions. I have to email and wait. It was more than 12 hours and there is no action yet. I am still waiting. They don't have the email id for login only mobile number. The fraud had accessed my account and changed the mobile number. I am unable to access through the email too. Very bad and worst app."
"I have ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut at 1:46am and it’s delivered at 2:40pm I called at Pizza Hut they didn’t picked up my call and expected delivery time was 21min but as per the delivery time my order was super late without any information and I found it very bad I was starving from hunger even I called Swiggy agent but that was not helpful for me after super delay I found my order at 2:40am that was not pizza that was base of rubber and this is very bad and I dumped that pizza in dustbin because it was totally spoiled and it was not worth eatingI must say they don't have respect for customer, worst customer service ever received from a company.For a second if you feel ashamed of yourself at least respond to my email with an update.please think twice before ordering from Swiggy.Very unhappy customer"
Wrost experience  i paid Money but  food was not delivered to me   taking Money and Not delivering food  im e-mail to swiggy support no one replying to slove my Prblm  🙏💯 Wrost delivery app
"Agent name- anwesha behera, I have ordered from swiggy, and I came from night shift, I thought that they would deliver my order within the given timeline, however they would not be able to, I was connected to the agent, instead of pacifying me, he just cancelled the order and provided me the refund, I have asked multiple times to close the chat, he does not, he was just ignoring my messages and just asking me to send an email, You people should educate your agents, and should guide them, how to deal with customersI want to you take an action against him and send me an apology letter"
"Delivery not up to mark. I got charged for cancelling a order. My app made the order twice. In another day, my order was not marked completed by DE so he kept calling me"
They have a horrible escalation process which that makes you repeat everything trice so rhat you are fed up by the end of it and dont raise any concern.
Swiggy is very bad application waste of your time. Don't use it. Every day dinner time order accepting and then Doesn't delivered.
"I'm from hyderabad,order no.191841704673604, I have a very worst experience with swiggy in food order and instalation I have ordered food for my kid the restaurant they sent rotten food which is not fresh, I think they sent left over food, many orders happened same with swiggy food delivery and instamart,I complained to swiggy customer care but they simply closed the  complaint, every time they are doing the same, they won't respond and they won't give any resolution for rotten food delivered by swiggy"
"We were trying to place a COD ORDER #154622948166033 on September 25. However as we proceeded we were shown an error message that the order couldn't be placed at this moment.We placed a prepaid order from another account but when the order actually came, it was from both. We never received a confirmation message for the cod order nor any tracking details, not even a delivery call. Yet the order was somehow placed and processed. Due to swiggys technical malfunction we were now being asked to pay a cancellation charge. The customer executive said that these charges would be waived but that hasn't been the case yet. And even after reporting several times no solution for this has been given.I guess this was my last and the worst experience with swiggy and would never go for swiggy again if these are the kind of services they are providing.. very muchh dissatisfied by them..."
Worst companyI ordered food around 9.30 pm ...entered my home address... but in map it showed wrong location ...it showed near restaurant... delivery boy denied to deliver as he will get less money from company for long distance delivery ....then costomer care call me for address confirmation ...i confirmed my address...then senior management person call me ....he said delivery boy is not ready to deliver as address is wrong ..then I said I entered correct address then he said no but on map it showed another location ...so you HV 2 options cancel this order with 0 returned ....or you have to pay delivery boy extra amount ...but I already paid delivery charges plus tip to the boy ...now they are asking more money ...We were hungry not feeling well..no one was in home to help out and this is there worst management services....I never going to order from sweegy again ....just prefer Zomato ....my 1 St and last order from sweegy ....
Worst customer experience and support I had a chat with Arinabh ! And he closed the chat on my mouth I was telling my concern I have mailed in for the same when i ordered kulcha lassi was spilled over that when i order Domino's pizza was overcooked cheese dip was missing worst they are worst and there customer care representative makes this more bad
"I opened Swiggy app and it mentioned free Lays worth 50 if I ordered for more than 199. I ordered for more than 199 but Lays did not come. On chatting with customer support of Swiggy, they mentioned since it was a freebie, we can't do anything about it. I felt cheated. This is how companies like Swiggy lure you into buying things and then don't stick to their promise."
Order No:163061754196824RestaurantSweet MagicI was charged for Dry Fruit Barfi (Sugar Free) but never delivered. Sent an email to Swiggy but no response.Swiggy has lost a customer for ever.
They deliver food as well as grocery items in a really quick time. Their prices are also very competitive.
Swiggy never for customer service only for payment everytime delay and say sorry delivery boy have two orders for delivery I have ordered khamari roti now think what happened when we received
They show d8fferent location restaurants in the app. N take the money . But once u pay the money they dont deliver . Cheap people. They can go n beg on the street . N provide 1 minute to csncell. Thst int b podsible for sny customer .they know very well.
"Order I'd is ORDER #160580661230375 . I ordered chicken wings and chicken dimsum.Only chicken dimsum was delivered and chicken wings was not delivered.I paid the amount for both.Ask the delivery partner regarding it. I paid 188rs for the chicken wings. I want the refund of that amount.Refund my amount . The delivery person Rabikant Prasad and Help executive Irshad assured me that my amount 188rs will be refunded to me. But it's not done so . Why should I pay for the food not delivered to me .Please enquire with the delivery partner,he is a fraud. He didn't come with my order,took the amount from me and said to me that chicken wings amount will be refunded. Why should I pay for the order not delivered to me."
"Worst app for delivery use zomato instead if on India , these guys scammed me and my family had ordered food and got cancelled by the delivery driver with no refund"
They are thieves!My driver got lost and didn’t deliver the order and Swiggy cancelled the order without refunding money. They didn’t deliver my food and they took my hard earned money.It screwed up my schedule too.They will steal from you any chance they get.
"I am not happy with Swiggy's current behavior. The food partner is bad, and the food is worse, seriously. I raised a complaint. But there was no response from the customer support team"
Worst App as a Customer and as an employee. TOXIC work-culture.
"It already happened to me twice. Both times I paid money before delivery. The Delivery boys never called me and posted that they didn't get the address and canceled the order. I never got the refunds both times as well.Worst Experience from this company. The customer care says they believe their delivery boys more than the customers. I spent more than 3100 altogether and all I got was a flat response from the team that they cannot refund. The first time I had ordered Biryani worth 2700 from Ruman Restaurant Hyderabad. I had some guests arrive at home, and it was dinner time. We all were hungry. The Guy called me once and before I could explain the address, hung up, and never picked up the call again. Then after continuously calling him, he picked up again and said he was going back as he couldn't find the address, and hung up again. The second time my wife ordered ice cream worth Rs 480, and similar experience. This company is not trustworthy anymore. I have now lost trust in all online food delivery companies because of this worst company run by the worst people. If I will order again using other delivery companies, I will order a COD mode, so that I don't lose it again"
"I am extremely disappointed with the service I've received from Swiggy on multiple occasions. While delayed order and poor food quality are common for Swiggy, the most 2 recent experiences have been the worst.On one instance, after waiting for an hour with no movement from the delivery executive, I called him only to find out that the restaurant wasn't responding. He mentioned it wasn't his responsibility to inform me, and customer support falsely claimed that the order was only ""slightly delayed.""On another occasion, my order was clubbed with another without any notification. Despite my food being ready, the delivery was delayed because the other order had an issue. Customer care again misled me by saying my order was on its way. After contacting the delivery person several times and facing rude behavior, I requested cancellation, only to be told I would be charged a cancellation fee. I had to escalate and spend over 30 minutes on multiple calls before the order was finally canceled.I hope the refund is processed as promised. Unfortunately, after these repeated issues and poor service, I've lost trust in Swiggy and will no longer be using their service."
Two times swiggy cheated. 1. I ordered cake with extra topping i payed for that toppings but the cake was delivered without it. When I raised a complaint in swiggy they simply said we will check but no refund was given. 2. I ordered burgers from kfc and they missed one burger in the order when I raised the complaint in swiggy they just respond we will check and email you within 6 to 8 hours and closed the case. I think we should stop buying from swiggy app. Big cheaters
"I had the worse experience with swiggy customer service. The driver they sent was extremely disrespectful and refused to arrive to my location unless I paid him extra. When I spoke to customer service, they didn’t seem too bothered to make it up for the waste of time, waiting time and the emotional distress I went through because of the driver and the whole communication. Instead of refunding me they said they would give me a coupon (which I never received) and when I brought up the fact that the whole thing was unfair they were robotic with their answers and didn’t seem to care at all about the customer dissatisfaction. Honestly the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life."
"I had placed an order for the following items from the Restaurant Sti Yati - Padmapriya complex, Kakinada via the order id: 1662025939492951. Veg Special Fried Rice - 12. Cashew Paneer - 13. Butter Naan - 2The butter naans from the order were not delivered and when an issue was raised to the customer support along with the images and even after sending an email as suggested, they were not ready to get the missing items delivered nor compensate me for the missing items.The second thing happened when I had ordered for a Plain rice bowl from KFC which is a vegetarian item and it was delivered mixed with a meat gravy. When the issue was raised to the Customer support, they had informed that they passed on the comments to the restaurant and would not happen in future. My stupidity was to take their word for it and place an order yet again which had the same consequences.Order IDs: 166082007328089 and 164898120835504They are not at all customer friendly like they used to be at the start of the launch and they seriously need to review their Customer service department."
Most pathetic delivery app.plz don’t order from here.they don’t respect customers.they will make u hold for 20 mins but won’t solve ur issue at all
"Swiggy is an excellent food delivery service in India. They offer attractive cashbacks and provide exceptional customer support. Unlike some other services, Swiggy ensures a smooth refund process without any hassle. I highly recommend giving Swiggy a try for a reliable and rewarding food delivery experience."
Swiggy will die very soon it is a horrible unkind shameful n Satanic
"I ordered from Swiggy and gave them my adress. While the order was getting prepared, I checked and found that the adress was different which I gave. I called them and said that the adress shown is wrong. They said they are cancelling my order and will not refund also. How why? this is clear case of Fraud."
"I’m writing to share my frustrating experience with Swiggy, which might help others make a more informed choice. I recently ordered boondi laddoo but received methi laddoo instead, a significant mix-up. I immediately reported the issue and provided photographic evidence, yet there has been no satisfactory resolution. This is the second time I've faced such negligence from Swiggy without any follow-up or remedy.Given the lack of effective support and resolution from Swiggy, I strongly recommend considering Zomato instead. My experiences with Zomato have been more reliable, with prompt service and better customer care. Don’t risk your order with Swiggy—choose Zomato for a more dependable food delivery experience."
"ORDER #170156107971899 | Sat, Mar 23, 2024, 03:05 PMOrder delivery with missing items.  On the spot I informed the delivery body that the items were missing. but he was in so a hurry that did not wait to see the items.  I wrote to Swiggy about this with proof of photos and video.   They said we can not refund the money.  But I do not want a refund I want the missing Items to be delivered. Swiggy takes charge and responsibility for the items to be delivered.  And they did not follow the commitment.  This happened to me a second time."
This is actually very infuriating. Swiggy customer care never attends calls. I tried calling as I received a fraudulence in the order from the restaurant Top N Town Vrindavan Nagar Katol Road Nagpur. I have been trying to call Swiggy customer care since morning also but in vain. They simply never answer calls.I had ordered 500 ml + 500 ml fruit overload icecream tubs but they sent me only 100 ml + 100 ml that too in white use n throw plastic cups. The Top N Town brand 500 ml tubs they didn't sent for which I had paid the money. What kind of nonsense is this. We pay and still they do fraudulence because this is an online platform. Manmarzi fraud chal raha hai. Top N Town and also Hyderabad.com biryani both have done frauds while sending the orders. Hyderabad.com biryani sent only small biryani in white use n throw plastic cup when I had ordered a value pack for 2 people Rs. 325 something when they gave 150 Rs. Off..but still I got biryani in this way openly they are doing this fraud. And when called the delivery partner they said please make a complain but there's no use.  Openly they are doing such scams and Swiggy by not attending customer care calls is fooling it's customers. Loot Macha rakhi hai in logo ne !!😡😡😡😡
"The worst service provided by swiggy. I ordered veg grilled sandwich no onion no Capsicum. clearly mention that special instruction  but I got a wrong order and not only did nothing turn up in time, but it took  more than 70 minute. and when I raised the issue  i asked for refund for that particular order i was stuck in  three separate customer service inquiries to get an explanation from the company about what had happened. Eventually I got short email stating  that fill the form and you will get refund in a week. but now it's more than 10 to 12 days i did not get my refund and I cannot able to chat with the customer service  for that particular order and issue.  swiggy escalation desk person name Ayushi promise me you will get refund after feeling the form which I mailed you and you will not facing any other issue regarding the same but still I didn't get my refund and  also they are not connecting to me and I am unable to connect With their customer service. Very appointed and very worst service.  while facing issue everyone stop using swiggy now. they are not keeping their words not taking any actions don't waste our hard earn money.  very pathetic service by swiggy.The company should adjust their system to let people know whether items are correct or not so they don't create false expectations that order will arrive on time. There should also be a shorter processing time for refunds and better customer service."
Yesterday I order two items..but I received only one item...I speak customer care he say we refund the missing item money... But still now no response...what I do ....
Found cockroach in dosa and swiggy is not taking any action against hotel both are playing with people money and food

"To be honest after three years of using Swiggy this is the first major problem I have had with a restaurant. I ordered a 500gm cake from Sweet Truth in Margao Goa. I received a single slice which was 170gms at a total cost of 1070 rupees! At this point I found out that Swiggy customer care is rubbish! I have never in over 70 years of life found a more disinterested, lacklustre, obnoxious, useless group of people. Even more so when they escalate the problem and you find out the managerial people are more useless than the people who work under them. Customer care from a script is not what I expect from a large company. I have ended up with a refund of 514 rupees simply because I lost the will to live with them. However I am still about 300 rupees out of pocket. Although the financial loss is really insignificant, it is the principle of the way I was robbed that is the point here. Perhaps I should always order two meals with Swiggy and expect to get one!""Sorry and please have a full refund"" would have been the proper response. After all it is not even Swiggy's money, all they had to do was deduct it from the restaurant who after all were at fault). Note to Sweet Truth, you need to train your staff, teach them how to answer a telephone and probably pay them more so you can get staff who can do their job properly!"
"Restaurent accept the order, paid the money. Then Swiggy was not able to assign the delivery partner."
"Hello,I want to describe the worst experience with Swiggy where I ordered food at 1.20 pm and waited till 2.40 pm for food to get delivered. Initially the time showed to be 35 to 40 mins as delivery time, But after waiting for 1.5 hours I sought help from the customer support they said that they are also not able to connect to the delivery partner and asked me to call. I also called the delivery partner few times but it got unanswered, hence I asked the customer support to cancel my order and refund me.They said that they have cancelled the order and the refund will be credited to my source account within 2 hours.When the refund was not credited after 4 hours, I again complained to the customer support they said that because the order was cancelled they cannot refund my money.I mailed also to the swiggy support but again I got the same answer.From last 5-6 years I am using Swiggy and I never faced such issue and I was surprised that after raising the complaint several times Swiggy didn't help me when the fault was at their side.First they make me wait so much for the food to get delivered during lunch time and after promising for the refund they refused to return my money. I never expected this from Swiggy and for this I will not be able to order from Swiggy anymore."
Have to be very careful before making payment for an order.Swiggy sometimes automatically add tips without our knowledge.Had a bad experience recently and I informed the customer care immediately but they refused to help.Very dissappointed with swiggy
"They are not sending my food invoices to me, I just following up with them but no one is reverting. VERY BAD COMPANY!!!!"
"Worst service... I never expected such a bad response from swiggy. I made a paid order, but couldn't get it on time."
"I have not received my money yet and it had been more than an hour since I had placed the order with the delivery partner. When I told them, they were telling me that I am not on any plane. They spoke to me very rudely. of. Something bad happened to me and my food was completely cold so I did not receive it there."
"In the recent orders, swiggy service has been terrible."
"I’ve been a loyal Swiggy customer, but my recent experience was shocking and unacceptable. I ordered from Daily Kitchen - Homely Meals (Order ID: #184959817890277) and received uncooked food that was unsafe to eat. Even worse, I paid ₹70 for a 475 ml Coke but received a 250 ml bottle instead, which feels like a blatant scam.I contacted Swiggy support multiple times, requesting a refund, but all I’ve received are generic responses with no compensation or real resolution. As a customer, this is highly disappointing and a serious breach of trust.I expect basic standards of food safety, quality, and accuracy, but Swiggy has failed on all fronts. I am considering escalating this issue further through legal means if it’s not resolved.Swiggy, I urge you to take responsibility and address this immediately!#SwiggyComplaint #UncookedFood #FraudulentService #BadCustomerSupport #RefundPlease #DisappointedWithSwiggy #CustomerRights #TrustpilotReview"
"Swiggy's service left me thoroughly disappointed. My recent order experienced an inexplicable delay, and what's worse, my attempts to contact their customer service were met with complete silence. No updates, no apologies – just frustration. In a business built on promptness and communication, Swiggy failed miserably. Time is precious, and waiting indefinitely without any response is simply unacceptable. If you value your time and expect reliable service, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Swiggy's lack of accountability and communication is a deal-breaker for me."
"Recently, I had a rather disheartening encounter with Swiggy that prompted me to share my experience. On March 2nd, 2024, I placed an order, and within it was a refined oil product, part of a promotion promising 5 liters with an additional 1 liter free.To my dismay, upon receiving the order, the 1-liter free item was missing. When I contacted Swiggy's customer care, I was informed that the missing 1 liter was a complimentary item and not something I should expect to receive. This was contrary to the promotion's clear promise of 5 liters plus an additional 1 liter free.Even after escalating the matter to a senior representative, the offered compensation was a mere Rs. 50 coupon for the missing 1 liter, originally valued at Rs. 200. This resolution not only falls short of fair compensation but also raises concerns about the company's ethical practices.Such an experience has left me questioning Swiggy's commitment to customer satisfaction. I share this incident as a cautionary tale for others and hope that Swiggy reevaluates its policies to ensure transparent and fair resolutions to such discrepancies."
"I cancelled my cod order, they told me to pay the 100%  cancellations fee. I told them i have cancelled within 5 minutes, the restaurant wouldn't even have started the preparation. Also i have ordered different food at the same time from a different restaurant. After wasting my time with their customer support who was only given one pitch all they told me that its their policy if someone cancelled their order within “60 seconds” then only they can not put a cancellation charge otherwise its 100% cancellations charges on the next order. I asked can you yourself cancel order within 60 seconds. Leave cancellation can you think of cancellation. I have been ordering from swiggy since it was launched in the market and not once i faced this worst experience. After twice calling them after arguing with them they connected me with the manager. He told me he will give me coupons for the cancellation fee then if i apply i will not be payable if the cancellation charge. I used the coupon and saw that it was working.. but that day i didnt see that it adds the cancellation fee to the total amount and reduces the actual ordered foods charges and i still would be paying the same cancellation charge. Anyway.. i will not be using swiggy henceforth because who has the time. We use swiggy to reduce our work of actually going the restaurants and eating sitting at home the same food. But yes.. I learned a lesson.. i would have lost more if not for just 500rs. Please be aware.. the service is anyway worst might as well use another platforms or the restaurants for home delivery."
Without my consent they cancelled my order. They don't have minimum sense to take a consent from the customer.
This is SCAM in food industryI have ordered cake to surprise someone in Jaipur but they sent worst cake ever and ruined my surprise to loved ones.Not recommended
Worst swiggy employees are very rude fuvk of employees
Worst service pathetic they confirm my order and then they cancel my order and do not refund my order it's a scam
"The delivery agent scammed meI had ordered fried noodles from imperial hotel on Feb 27th, 2023.I paid delivery agent 229 rs online via upi.He claimed that he didn’t receive the amount, though the amount clearly was debited from my account.I showed him too but he refused to accept that he had received the money and ask me to pay again.I told him , there might be an issue on his app but he refused to leave.I again had to pay him 229 rs via upi.He also claimed in case the amount comes swiggy will refund my money back.It has been 3 days, swiggy is not refunding my money at all.I had complained on 27th February, to customer care and they acknowledged and reassured that I will get the money.I didnt receive yet.So i again tried to connect to customer care.The customer care agent whose name was Ekdisha, was highly stupid and uncooperative.She told me that I cannot ask for resolving this issue as 24 hours had passed.She also asked me for screenshot of my voice talk.I argued to connect to Supervisor, who too asked me for details and later verified it.He assured I will receive the refund in a day.I haven’t still received it.They are hiring goons who intimidate us to pay for an order already paid by spinning stories and their customer care is most unpleasant and unprofessional. They just dont want to work.I will demand from Swiggy management, that if a customer has an issue , then they must resolve it within 24 hours.If they cannot resolve it, then they cannot fix a deadline of 24 hours for us and blame the customer for raising the issue again.229 rs is hard earned money, and its my right to get my money back.Why should I pay the price for a criminal they hired, who is fooling and extracting money from innocent customers?Its such a big platform and they are reluctant to refund 229 rs!God knows, what would they do if the amount is higher."
My experience waste swiggy.. swiggy use only riders..no help to riders.
So many time delivery boys were rude.... Already deleted swiggy app...now i am using zomato❤️🔥
Ordered food . Taste was worst. Stale and expired food. Got only 12 rs refund against 236.  Zero response from swiggy. I will stop ordering
"Poor service from Swiggy. I had ordered some sweets, waited for 1.5 hours, after that the order was cancelled. The order was picked up by some other rider."
Swiggy Chennai is very worse.maximum time getting worse quality food and wrong items
"I love swiggy compared to zomato, Only difference is swiggy understands customer concerns and they understand them where as zomato is useless"
Undue delay on delivery due to that food  becomes cold.
"Hello my dear brothers and sisters, I request you not to order in Swiggy because Swiggy is becoming a fraud company and after the order is made to the customer and payment is made, when the time comes for delivery.  Call the customer and it is said that sir the delivery will not be possible in your area then the customer asks why it will not be possible then you say that our banda cannot go to that area then due to this I request you whether your order  If I cancel then we said ok sir please cancel the order will our payment be refunded then he said yes sir it will definitely be refunded but till now no status is visible of refund of payment it has been two days.  And there is no status of payment or refund, so you guys tell me, all the executives or delivery boys of Swiggy are doing this type of calculation, is it right? What are they doing? They take the order from the customer, get the payment done and when the delivery is done.  When the time comes, the executive himself calls and not the delivery boy himself calls the executive and says that if the order will not be delivered in your area, then your order is getting cancelled, then he cancels the order and forwards it to another customer.  Then by doing this to the customers also, the company is frauding less money and neither refunds your ₹ 1 nor does anyone do anything. Forward it as much as possible. You guys also give this feedback on heart because today it has happened with us, tomorrow may it happen with you.  We are warning you in advance that this may happen."
World top most fruad.  Very bad service.  Swiggy give 40k charges. Not talk to me refund.
Swiggy side fake order cancel veri bad pls not take the order ORDER #175417795018632
"Niranjan biswas  here ,I had order a cake on 13 october but there delivery partner cancelled my order and mention the reason (customer did not pick the call ) if i have already paid the amount then why i will not pick the call is there make any sense and i ask for refund then there customer care are worst they are stating that   as per our swiggy policy refund will be not proceed  ,so my suggestion never order from swiggy and zomato is better"
I have never seen a more stupid company and customer service than this.
I spoke with sumya in customer support she didn't resolve my query poor customer service
"There is no chance to give a Negative rating else I would have gave like -10000.I have always ordered from Swiggy no matter what. But the last few order I am really disappointed a lot especially with my ORDER ID: 161099385240178I mean what the f&&k is wrong with the Swiggy Policy and I mean litreally just WHY? Swiggy litreally charged my whole food + GST and so called ""Platform Fee"" amount for the order that I did not even recieve.I order food from restaurant which was available in the Swiggy. I have order from that restaurant before also. No issues at that time but this time. I litrealy waitied for more than 1 hour where I just needed to wait for like around 20-30 minutes. When I called the restaurant they said, we have packed your order, we need only 10 minutes for your order. The swiggy delivery agent did not show up, this is not our problem.I mean I am in hunger waiting for more than an hour and no agent was assigned. So I decided to cancel it as I did not want to be in hunger.But the f&&king Swiggy litreally charged me my whole amount for the Cancellation and called it as ""Cancellation Charges"". I mean why the hell am I supposed to pay any kind of amount where the total fault is on Swiggy??!!. I mean how will I even know within a minute that I will not recieve my order?? Cancellation is free only within a minute from the Order?? What kind of f&&king policy is this!!??I tried contacting them through every means possible but no hope in any mode of contact. Customer Support is a biggest S&&t. They just put your email in the completed list and never reply.We people could litreally sue them for this Cancellation charges.There should be some solution for this. This is so ridiculous.Also, the prices are high compared to any other platform additionally Platform Fee and Delivery Fee is insane.Please do not use Swiggy.PS: Trustpilot does not allow me to put bad words🙂"
My order is made pretty fast and their service is good
"I ordered a chicken chowmein by 1:51 And now it is 3:25 And customer care is saying that am unable to connect with the delivery partner sir I can refund your amount if you want it means after 1 hour they are saying that they’ll refund even if they don't have any commands of their riders. Customer care is giving me excuses that today is new sure that's why we are unable to give the Better service if you guys are not sure about the service please shut down that app or that day or announce that due to technical errors, we are unable to taking request if you are taking request or payment you are supposed to give the service to the customer"
"this is the 4 th time in 2 or 3 months that the customer service of swiggy is not only incompetent but they treat you like fools and send you on a wild goose chase, which would actually be more appetising if it weren't figurative.in the last 4 months around 15 to 20% of orders are problematic. that's a high percentage! however here are the following approaches from swiggy to resolve this to their satisfaction, even if it isn't suitable for the customer1. the 1st problem was not taken seriously and requested to let go as feedback that would go back to the restaurant2. the next time they refunded less than the product value claiming that's all the system would allow and processed it as a swiggy coupon instead of reverting into the original payment method - this is a game for 2 reasons - (a.) it doesn't feature in your refunds, so it gives the illusion that you didn't process a refund request and memory may fail to recall it without the log. (b.) the only way to not lose your money is to buy from them despite their pathetic customer support and lack of taking responsibility3. on 2 other occasions they clubbed an ice cream delivery and hot sandwhich delivery with a delivery to a different address. the other address was OUT OF THE WAY not in the same route! thus the ice cream was melted and the ""hot grilled sandwich"" cold! a clubbed delivery should at the very least be in the same route and not add road time to the delivery person's route! they said they could only send feedback but when i pushed and insisted the senior  person processed a partial refund where calculation of refund value has no rhyme or reason! and begging to let the difference go as a feedback to the back end. 4. this time was beyond incredible!  its starts with the bot processing a refund when i requested to chat with an agent after uploading images of a chicken ceasar salad without chicken. when finally an agent responds she says the image is invalid because its not a sandwich! when i shared that i had guests and needed a chicken ceasar salad they responded that as a refund is already processed they can't do anything about it. with guests at home for dinner i had to be on hold for more than 20 min while a series of incompetent service agents couldn't validate the photo, couldn't and wouldn't admit that a bot or other agent wrongly processed the refund instead of letting me chat with an agent, and said that when on call they can't  refer to the chat, so i had to keep repeating my problem and was repeatedly put on hold! i wonder if the customer agents are allowed to put themselves in the shoes of customers who placed an order with a certain quantity because it caters to a calculated number of corresponding people at the dining table!in all this refunds are processed on base value, that is before GST and GST over the refunded value is still held by swiggy. which means that you have paid gst on a service or product you didn't avail. well at least the customer agent couldn't justify or provide calculation proving that the refunded value was inclusive of GST!additionally if you don't take the pictures and raise the complaint immediately then ""you're too late"". when you do raise the ticket immediately they expect you to be connected all through and respond instantaneously even if they take 5 or 10 min to revert. by the time you're done with dealing with absolutely incompetent and unsatisfactory customer support your food is cold and appetite lost."
"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with a recent experience I had on April 21st while ordering from Domino's KR Puram outlet through Swiggy.Domino's KR Puram:* I placed an order at 9:28 pm, expecting delivery by 9:58 pm as per their advertised 30-minute guarantee.* The order arrived a staggering 35 minutes late at 10:25 pm.* Attempts to reach the delivery person and the restaurant (using the number provided on Swiggy) were unsuccessful (calls to delivery person unanswered, restaurant number invalid).* Upon arrival, the delivery person was unaware of the 30-minute guarantee. He connected me to the store manager who:    * Denied the existence of the guarantee (despite being advertised)    * Refused to acknowledge the delay or offer any compensation    * Became increasingly rude during the conversation    * Ultimately refused to deliver the order altogether    * The delivery person then snatched the order back and left without a word.This entire interaction with Domino's KR Puram was unprofessional and unacceptable. Their disregard for advertised policies and their rude customer service is a serious concern.Swiggy Customer Care:In an attempt to resolve the issue, I contacted Swiggy customer care on three separate occasions. Unfortunately, each interaction proved equally frustrating:* I was connected to a different representative each time.* All three representatives disconnected the call abruptly without offering a solution.* There was a complete lack of apology for the inconvenience caused.Swiggy customer care's behavior only compounded the negative experience I had with Domino's KR Puram."
Worst service ever you never get the order on time
"Better than Uber eats, but still have lot of problems"
Swiggy is best for providing good quality food. I loved
They're the worst service company in the world
Customer service is very bad
Worst company ..all time please don’t use there app.
Firstly I place my order and then after about half an hour later I check the devil was no delivery executive placed and when I started chatting they said we are trying to find the delivery executive we are trying to find a delivery executive and then all of a sudden a person name Nitin came on and said that I will help you with the issue and he also was finding a delivery executive but it to another 15 minutes and he did not responsive and back to check and deyar vas actually I delivery executive appointed however when I went back to tell him that okay that's fine I see the there is a delivery executive appointed he cancelled my order because I had requested it previously when I did not know that there was someone who was bringing food and later he is telling me that I will refund your money which they did and then he said I will give you a coupon of 85 rupees I don't understand the compensation of 85 rupees what do you actually get for 85 rupees it was already 10 o'clock and I have to fend for myself after coming home from work and ordering food for my kids which has already been delayed way too much during exam season is absolutely ridiculous that people from swiggy do not consider the back story of the people who actually order food from their app this is highly UNacceptable
They r THIEVES
"Worst experience with swiggy , late delivery, unsatisfactory response by customer executive"
very very poor service
uneducated customer care
Zomato is better than swiggy...worst service by swiggy .. items will be missed
"Apart from worst service, I was cheated by swiggy by not delivered the food and not refunded the money. Swiggy is a cheating app, don't use it."
Delivery boy not delivered food and customer care not supported and money is not refund 😤😔
such bakwash and basterd bich service  plz i m not suggest swiggy any person sale chutiye
"ORDER #157921007954231In India we have only 2 known company for food delivery. But, here I would like to share my review that zomato is best. Moreover, I will request @doordash to take over in India as well. Today I have waited for an hour to get the food. And, in between I got the call from delivery partner that they can't delivery the food here. But, valet mention he can't reach till that place."
My parcel not my handoverAnd delivery complete messageCompany not response and customer not happyDelivery boy very bad behaviour
Refund my money Maine order cancel kr diya h par mere refund kab tak aayega 1 min me kuch cancel nhi hota h.. isliye mujheSwiggy  aa[p bahut bekar h aur services  bahut late h
I am extremely extremely disappointed with the service for my order.  Below was cancelled saying the address was wrong and as a fraud the restaurant has taken all the money (INR 969) and did not deliver.The address was not wrong also the delivery instruction was provided immediately after placing the order in the app. We also guided the delivery agent with the address over call. We also said if it's difficult we can make extra payment on delivery.This is not at all acceptable. This was my first order on swiggy and has left me with extreme disappointment. I will surely never use this service again.
Swigy is the worst food delivery app. Recently I ordered fruits and salad from Swigy Instamart but they delivered something else and once I requested for replacement they denied and even they denied for refund. Here is the order ID - 155762740805936
Absolutely unprofessional with no apathy towards customers. Ordered food for my father who is a cancer patient at 7.50 pm. Swiggy app was showing expected time as 8.30 pm. Food didn't reach even by 8.50 pm. Called restaurant where i was shocked to know that swiggy didn't pass the order to restaurant even after full online payment. Restaurant person told me he will deliver order but i will have to pay again. I was frustrated. Tried calling swiggy. No answers initially. At 9.30 pm they asked me to cancel order as they could not find delivery partner. So finally even after 2 hours swiggy had no answers as to where my money went and why no good was delivered. Absolutely pathetic service. Zomato is far better than swiggy. Uninstalling the app.
I had a safety concern which I had let swiggy known but no action taken till date. Never order from SWIGGY. They seem to have ZERO CONCERN FOR YOUR SAFETY.
They have amazing delivery services and great customer support
"I have ordered my first order on swiggy with correct delivery address but due to tech issues or your system glitch location get auto changed and also your team cancelled my order without informing me anything & not refunding my amount of 241 rs. Last time I was chatting with  Sadiq  from chat support, really his behaviour & support was very bad, I am not happy with the service & I am very disappointed 😔.Take my feedback seriously for Sadiq.Now my question is:-If there is no my fault so why should I pay cancellation fee?If your team was not able to deliver my order so why they have accepted the order?How order get cancelled without informing anything to the customer?"
"The worst food delivery app, while ordering it showed me a delivery time of 20 minutes  but still waiting for last one and a half hour. Their customer care persons are manner less,'ORDER CANCEL KARNA HAI TOU KARO, REFUND 7 DIN K BAED MILEGA'"
After payment if the location is little far they wont deliver and eat the money.Zomato is best compared to swiggy which is not genuine
"Fraudulent company. Poor customer service. No use of it. They didn't give me refund for undelivered products from swiggy's instamart. The customer support is just to convince you, it's not the real support. It says the same thing, like ai. Even emails are like that. Didn't give any compensation for late delivery. I regret using this app. I'm disappointed that I didn't see the reviews in the trustpilot before itself. Zomato is better than yours. No cash on delivery for groceries when I have ordered. I lost my money. They don't care about the customers.They didn't help me in anyways. Just stressed me out."
This app is very bad. This does not help the customer. Swiggy is not returned my money. Please ban swiggy app
"Swiggy is the number one thief whose owner is the biggest thief I did the transaction, the transaction failed, the payment went to Swiggy but Swiggy returned the money saying it was within two hours, today it's been 4 days, the money has not been returned and what's more, their customer service people , Second, I re-ordered again and my item was missing, neither the money was returned nor any service was given to me and today on 23rd September 2023 I again placed an order but that too was completely bad.Neither am I getting any money back nor any service, instead I am being given ₹ 20 or ₹ 10 as return through coupons. I am paying Rs 500, instead of that I am getting only ₹ 20 ₹ 10. The owner of Swiggy is such a big ass sister ..f...Sister's..f.. are filling their houses with customer's money and putting others' money in their ass. Whoever is the owner of Swiggy is stealing everyone's money. Sister's f...."
"Worst company ever. Just to make money, orders are taken and after 2 hours I am told that there r no delivery partners and that to when I contacted Askin for the order.  It has happened couple of times for which I kept quiet. This service is not to serve customers but to cheat and harass customers. Not bothered after payin every charges, customers r left hungry for hours. And thn I am told to cancel the order. I feel Zomato has more concern about their services than this useless company."
My daughter ordered today. It is the second consecutive time that an incomplete order was delivered. The fraud of Swiggy is exposed when they pretend to give a compnesation coupon of Rs.65 and add delivery charges of Rs.100!. What a fraud company
worst services ever as i ordered and paid 337 via UPIafter 04 minutes i cancelled this order they are saying total amount is non refundable how is it possible to cook food with in 02 minutes you guys are literally CHOR fake company
"IN MY LIFETIME, I WOULD HAVE MADE MORE THAN THOUSANDS OF ORDERS BUT THEY RESULTED ONLY IN BAD EXPERIENCES."
"Absolutely lousy CS. Delivered my order in the wrong city. Had to type this 4 Times in the chat as I was passed from one CS to the other who all said ""we cannot see your previous message ON THE SAME LIVE CHAT"". Which joker is running this platform? Zero stars"
"Swiggy is really pathetic! If they continue serving like this, soon they will go out of business"
Pathetic experience with Swiggy. Delivery partner didn't pick food on time. Waited 71 minutes for a food which need to be delivered from just 1.5 km distance
"Unworthy, irresponsible staff,It was a bad experience I’m facing from last one week when I ordered they missed one item and asked for money refund they are saying money will refund with in 2-3days but it almost 1week no response Even when I’m talking with customer care people they discontinued the chat and dint given proper response"
Useless provider they just even try to grasp every single chance you do not pickup the call to cancel the order and do not refund the money. It's totally waste of money and promoting wrong practice if you order through swiggy.
My order ( range 3km ) took 110 mins and It’s was the worst experience because no good assistance and Swiggy didn’t pick up my calls My recommendation to people plz delete Swiggy app and find a new 1
"I had ordered Chocolate cake and chocolate mousse from Ganache factory, Indiranagar, Bangalore.  Order number 176799811567. The order was picked up in time, but a kilometer and half from my house the app showed no movement of the delivery partner. This lack of movement went on for 5-10 minutes. I made a complaint on their chat , Neha responded, but it took her a long time to find out what was the issue. She said he is on the way and will arrive in 10- 15 minutes, only much later telling me that his bike has broken down. At no time was a solution given by her. Swiggy could have sent another partner to him to complete order or made him catch an auto, and then reimbursed him. Instead he comes walking in the sun and arrives after 20 minutes, the items had melted, mousse was water and cake sodden. Neha was no help at all and the whole event was of inexperience and inefficiency. They have no contingency plan. What if he had broken down 3 to 4 kms away?. These incidents are occurring again and again. Totally disgusted with Swiggy. Colin Nazareth"
"I made an order through swiggy by mistake( I was calculating the charge and was choosing another food). I called the restaurant right away and said not to cook my order, and told me to cancel the order through swiggy customer service. They said they will charge still Rs 573(cost of the order) for the next order I place. I said I made the order by mistake and conveyed the restaurant not to make the order so that there is no food wastage and I conveyed it to swiggy. The customer service told me that if a cancelation had to be made, it should be made within one minute. Bad impression was made to me at that time. Keep up in this same manner. You guys will be washed away by zomato soon"
"Just got scammed the amount 1049 by Swiggy ..Didn’t deliver it at the given address and  when asked the delivery guy to deliver he refused saying it’s far , so I had to cancel it but after the cancelling the refund is not initiated saying I didn’t cancel before 1 minute of placing order ! Like what !?Have email them , contacted the team but no further response till now ..Such a scam"
Worst cancellation policy. How could someone cook food within 1min. Will the food not waste if the entire amount is charged as cancellation fee?
"Swiggy scammers are swiggy employees, one hours waited and still no response for refund, they asking images,  legal team Plz help with these frauds. I m going to file the case. Don't order using swiggyPosting on media, with Audio vide proof"
"In the last 24 hours i placed 3 ordes thru Swiggy at A2B , Udupi Upahar and North Indian Bhukkad. All 3 cases involved a refund from Swiggy for items not delivered.In 2 of them the entire amount had to be refunded.  In A2B they did not have one item for which they took the money.The status changes from order received by Swiggy. Only when it changes to Therestaurant is preparing  , you can be sure that the restaurant has accepted the order. In Udupi Upahar cse the status never changed. The chatbot not being aware of this nuance sends inane assurances. In this case i was told the restaurant was closed which was untrue. In the last case , the order was received, cooked and picked up. The ride takes max 15 minutes. However for a good 20 minutes Delivery partner was not moving or picking up called. I spoke to CRM who also couldnt get thru. Wantedto take a fresh order. I asked him whether they were not worried that the deliverypartner had met with an accident or fallen sick suddenly. The response was "" He is not picking up the call."" I cancelled my order and suggested they send someone to the location where he was stationary. Not much concern was shown. I guess the training of CRM and the mindset of Swiggy top mgt does not consider this important.  I would have given 1 star but I have met a great number of conscientious partner in the past."
"Swiggy rip people off in name of swiggy one membership, i was chatting to their agent on chat name Pratap which was not helpfull even didnt helped after asking for senior he didnt transfer chat, n they do not take any responsibility of restaurant delivering wrong order, then I chat with Abul n acc to him swiggy policies says customer should send an email, means swiggy will not help customer who are illeterate and dnt knw hw to type or send it,,,, itss discrimination swiggy is doing in India"
"I had yesterday ordered food, complete meal box from UBQ Barbeque Nation, thru swiggy. The veg briyani was stale, had a foul smell, the paneer makhani was watery with 6-7 small cubes. Roti was burnt, dal & other items too were stale. Had to throw away the food. Tried calling the restaurant. Wrote a feedback on swiggy, no help. It was a terrible experience."
"Ordered food for my daughter today at 6.11 AM, showed in 20 mins the food will arrive , when I called the delivery executive, he said the food is not prepared, when I called restaurant, they gave me no visibility of when the food will be sent , he refused to give a response saying this is customer care, I wonder why have they given the contacts of people who can’t even give a proper update. Then the food came at 7.10 and I refused to take delivery as my daughter had already left for her school by the time they came. Now to my surprise, I am being penalized for the irresponsible act of Swiggy and it’s partners in not meeting the deadline, so they have levied a cancellation fees of the total value of the food that I had ordered in my account!! Isn’t it insane to do that? Swiggy is taking its customers so lightly, we need to come forward to fight against them for such insane acts, instead of compensating for the delayed orders that was not even accepted , how can they even have this policy of penalizing the customer? A day before we ordered some items that were completely stale but they didn’t do anything about it yet. Swiggy has become really horrible these days"
If restaurant provide rotten food then swiggy didn't refunded the amount...it's disgusting...by swiggy restaurants provide all the rotten items...
"Has anybody ever tried complaining about the wrong food item delivered (insta cafe) ? They write that the refund has been credited and the same does not get credited in the account. In order to ensure that we get the refund , I even tried asking for the refund in swiggy wallet, to which they respond, ""swiggy wallet service is unavailable"".. so where does the refund go ? It's never or rarely done . It's a scam"
"Very very bad service, i am booking food not received delivery partner not received any call 🤙"
idk why they have such a low ratings here but they have been lifesaver since the day i landed india!
No customer support for poor quality of food recieved. Swiggy has bots responding to complaints instead of employing real customer support agents.
"Well I placed an order with Swiggy, and guess what, the pizza I received was completely flipped, I even provided video evidence. But for an order of 1179rs Swiggy provided me with the support of 236rs."
Poor service after sale No proper refundCheap restaurant are listed
"their service is very bad. there is no feedback to the sender if the package is not delivered and if you do not follow up they will simply keep the packages by the delivery boy. No feedback to the sender at all. Do not ever recommend their service. and they need to close this service , the sooner the better. worst experience."
Delivered burnt cheese roll and then offered a coupon code for Rs 20 off. Terrible support team! Burnt food is a known carcinogenic!!
"Worst app whenever i food my ordered from swiggy it will not came on tym,even todayI ordered ice cream at 9:30 pm And now its 10:50 still order not rcvd I think they hire worst delivered partner Worst Worst Worst. Service"
I am joined 1 year back swiggy partner but I can't do some vehicle problem I met near RR nagara swiggy office he told your ID is permenent block we can't do anything...this is not 1 growing company quality one day will you down fall
I ordered items through swiggy instamart and when i got it an item was missing. And when i contacted the customer service they told they couldn't validate my cliam.how the helll am i suppose to show an missing item to them? Bunch of moronns 🤬🤬🤬
"Swiggy is the worst site to order ur food, they don’t value their customers, I received totally stale food which i have to throw cz no one could have that, i paid 440 rs and they are just offering 88 rs coupon, nd that too with terms and conditions, with previous orders delivery is showing confirmed and no one came for 2 hrs they just want the money and not providing any assistance to the customers, even i mailed them so they blocked my swiggy account too thats soo rude from their side i would prefer to give them negative stars.. pls don’t spend ur hard earned money on this site"
"Very bad service in swiggyI have ordered of ""Paneer  Tikka cheese pizza""and somehow the deliver my pack to some other place and after consulting customer executive they told me to cancel order i will get full refund. even that customer executive cancelled my order. now they Denny to pay full refund and took cancellation charges.I even dont want to rate 1 NEITHER CARING FOR THE CUSTOMER"
i m order 317 food but delivery boy cancelled order and eat hotel manager say i dont cancelled order boy cancelled
"I have order from Swiggy on 12 July , I have received incomplete order from the rider name Vishnu kumar . I have ordered 1 garlic combo and 2 medium size pizza for which I only got 1 garlic combo and One medium size pizza . Sharing Order id 172246781063 .It is disgusting that having trust on Swiggy partner , your rider does these kind of things . Today is my anniversary on which have ordered and you people spoiled it ."
"Most useless, needless & worthless food delivery company in India. It is a group of cheaters, scammers & fraudsters, they are always ready to loot you by giving FAKE DISCOUNT COUPONS, FAKE PRICES IN RESTAURANT MENUS & EXTRA HIDDEN CHARGES.Shame on you swiggy. You are the WORST FOOD DELIVERY COMPANY ON THIS PLANET."
"The worst food delivery company in India. FAKE discounts, FAKE prices, rude behavior, pathetic customer support and too much greedy company, that always thinks about own profit."
Most of time order get delayed. On contacting customer service they always make favors to delivery partner  not to customer. So better to switch Zomato
"SWIGGY INSTAMART should be the last place for you to buy items as these ppl are bloody chors. They do not have cash on delivery option and once money paid they will throw any rotten item on your face. No call centre, no customer service to talk. Your money is gone for good and you wil get chatbot reply for better experience in future. Go for BLINKIT much better service and most of all hears and solves the issue."
"On 17th July At 7:15 PM, My Wife Ordered Groceries From Swiggy Instamart. It Promised 20 Mins Delivery. After Waiting For 2 Hours We Find Out That The Order Status Is ""Finding Delivery Partner"". After Initiating Chat With Customer Support, I Was Informed That My Order Cannot Be Cancelled Due To Technical Issue At Their End. So Money Could Not Be Refunded. They Told Me To Wait 48hours To Receive An Email..I Am A Middle Class Working Person, I Rely On Swiggy Because I Don't Get Time After Office. Because Of This We Had To Miss Our Dinner.ITS BEEN 15+ HOURS, SWIGGY STILL SAYS ""FINDING DELIVERY PARTNER"" . NO REFUND WAS GIVEN, NO RESOLUTION WAS GIVEN."
I have been using swiggy from long time. But they have become very unethical and unprofessional recently.  They always take orders late hours then keep you waiting for more than ETD and after wasting your lot ofctime they cancel order with one ir other lame excuse.  This has happened multiple time with me recently.  ZOMATO IS WAY BETTER AND PROFFES AND BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICETHEN SWIGGY. swiggy is playing around alot this days nad making fool of customers...
"Recently we were in Puri and ordered food from Fisherman’s kitchen worth Rs.1914 and when the food was delivered we discovered that 2 items worth Rs. 347 are missing, immediately I raised a complaint with Swiggy and as per their instructions sent images of the items received. Called the restaurant also and they said that they are aware and they will refund the money but sorry to say nothing happened. Since then I have been following up with Swiggy and today they sent a mail stating that the can’t do anything and offered me coupon worth Rs. 66. It is a joke I think and the company is run by bunch of Jokers. I don’t know what to do and who to approach because they are a big company but indulged in sheer cheating the consumer. You can’t trust them anymore because once the money is paid you may not receive any food.Another instances with them, I booked for genie to pick up some sweets for my friend and deliver to his address. The delivery guys refused to pick up the sweets and Swiggy deducted hefty fine and refunded few Rs. Being a Non Resident I could not do anything but had to forfeit the money for the sweets as well as Swiggy fees.I am done with them for good but advising others to think twice before using their service anymore. Do you want to make a cheat richer?"
"Pathetic customer care service, order marked as delivered, order not received. Delivery agent not picking up the phone. Customer care says send email and resolution time is 24 hours. Shiva manager from Swiggy says this is the process. I called 2nd time, another agent says I am refunding the amount or I can again place the same order for you. This kind of process breech not expected from Swiggy. Swiggy ppl plz make sure to listen to the recordings and atleast do something. I am anyways switching to Zomato, much better service then Swiggy. And this is the second time I have faced similar issue."
I have been Swiggy for sometime and never had an issue until today when the order was cancelled by mistake and they just debited the entire money and neither was ready to refund the money nor deliver the food . I was so upset and learnt a lesson and decided not to use Swiggy anymore and I will not recommend Swiggy to anyone . They are just Cheaters
I am highly disappointed with Evergreen restaurant.  I ordered kalakand from Evergreen Dwarka through swiggy. They had sent some very bad quality sweet which was not at all consumable. I have been struggling to get the refund or the replacement but none of my concern has been taken care. I blame swiggy as well for not taking any action to resolve my complaint. All they are sending me standard reply that we have forwarded your feedback to the restaurant and next time they will take care of that. My question is what about this time? What if by mistake we would have consumed it and lately we face food poisoning and landing to the hospital? None of them are taking the responsibility.  I will never recommend anyone to order from them and from now onwards one should really think twice before placing any order through swiggy as they are least concerned about your health and money. They are stealing money from you by anyhow.
Big fraud company. Food doesn't get delivered and we have end up going to bed without food and above all they are okay with this when raised a complaint. Have stopped using their service. Hand heard customer care executive laughing in the background when called to complaint.
"Today i placed an order from the Restaurant California Burrito Bangalore, and after 30 mins i got a call from Swiggy, Mr.Alfia informed me to cancel my order, I asked why should I cancel, and he replied that the Restaurant need 30 more minutes to prepare my food, I said I have placed order 30mins before, by the time it may be ready, he said no sir, Restaurant needs 30 more mins and my rider will not wait for that much time, so cancel your order. I said no I don't want to cancel the order, please assign the next rider to pick up my food and closed the call. Then I called directly the Restaurant to understand why they need 30 more mins, i was surprised when i got the answer from Restaurant, they said your order was picked up already please check with Swiggy, meantime I got a message your order got canceled. Then i called Swiggy to enquire i came to know my order got wrongly picked up by another delivery person, so customer care person Alfia played smart with me by blaming the restaurant needs time. I escalated this to the escalation team but instead of solving the issue, they offer me rs. 300 coupon. I said no to the coupon, then connected with the Sr. Escalation officer, but very bad response from him, he is not even ready to understand the issue or give a solution. Simply time wasted and asked me to write an email to the support team for a response."
Cheating and rude behaviour from swiggy customer careI ordered food - I cancelled they have not refunded single rupee and also not delivered the product !!!The customer care was very rude and cheating - not listening and not professional
"This fellow is cheating when coming to vegetables and fruits. When he sells in pieces he is selling literally very small pieces for the right price. It's really horrible how he is cheating, because no one can write a review on swiggy instamart."
C class service. I ordered for desert and bstds have delivered chicken biryani. Worst of all no action by the c class team . They deserve to close their show.
At INSTAMART they are sending EXPIRED ITEMS
Every time delayfar order take one hour or  half in hour time
I was placing the items in cart and pressed back button it automatically took the order as COD. I spoke to customer care they cancelled the order but without even informing me they charged the complete cost as cancellation fees.
Their delivery guys take code and don't deliver food to the customers
"VeryBad Experience already eaten food they deliver very worst experience i faced in shimoga, don't use swiggy."
Thief they are .: this is third time in a month I ordered food and it was not delivered
Swiggy is cheat . They give you damage product then promise you a refund then never issue it . Then lying to customer . And giving all sort of excuses
Worst food delivery app. We are Shiva Realty and Katemodel consultants ordered food from swiggy. The money was deducted from Gpay but food was never delivered. There is no function in app to contact customer care or restaurant.
Pathetic. No value for time. Takes over 1 hour to delivery 4 packs of milk from Insta mart. Do not use Swiggy.
"Hi Swiggy,Till now I did not get any positive response from your side and this is very very disrespectful to me that you don't care about your swiggy customers. This shows that you are only attracting the people by giving buy 1 get 1 offer on #chicagopizza but you are not on your words. This my worst experience with swiggy and i lost my money because of you swiggy. My order I'd is #170162772143. Please initiate my refund as soon as possible because I ordered from swiggy. Disgusting experience with swiggy #disgustingswiggy #worthlessswiggy and #zomato is far better than swiggy atleast they don't show the fake offer to the customer."
"Please don’t order from swiggy if you you really want to enjoy food with you family as delivery time is fake and you will receive frozen food, zomato is far batter than swiggy atleast you receive your fresh food on time and can enjoy with family.It has happened multiple times with me so stop swiggy"
"Every time I order food they take 1-2 hours to deliver food even if its just 2km away.. It is better to just go out and get your own food. I have uninstalled it. Location - Banjara Hills, Hyderabad."
I order a item of 130 rs they show delivery charges of 80 rs I uninstalled the app immd
"This is another time I am writing to you that I have not received my food delivery, and the order has been marked as delivered. I tried reaching your delivery executive on your helpline none seemed to be working. It took ages for you to take my concern over chat, and your chat support guy gave me lectures instead of a refund. A few mins back, he asked me if he wanted me to get the money refunded, and when I asked for a refund, he just denied it. Is that how it works in Swiggy? I ordered food for my elderly parents, and at this hour, I am fighting to get my money back, and they are struggling. This is highly unprofessional and pathetic. PFA screenshots for your reference. From your delivery partner to you chat support, every person is inexperienced. I want a REFUND at the earliest.This was the email I shared with their team when I faced an issue with the food delivery a day back. The reply I got was highly unprofessional. They just marked the ticket as resolved without even answering me correctly. There is N number of points to dislike about Swiggy. 1. Pathetic customer support. 2. When you try to call them in an hour of need, they harass you like anything by not answering your call and instead make you hear their recorded speech3. When your food order goes undelivered, instead of helping the customer, they ask you to email and close the chat without answering you correctly or without a proper resolution. 4. Their chat support team claims to refund you and then says they can give you a coupon instead; when you accept it, they ask you to drop an email again and straightaway close the chat. 5. They are just robbing people and harassing them without reason. 6. Their delivery partner just switched off Their services are getting pathetic day by day"
Worst experience.Ordered at 8pm No call answering by delivery person as well restaurant after trying for many times.No any direct cust care / call center number. So can't reach them directly. Got computeried call for unable to deliver your order. And come to know that they will.refund amout. That to arount 10 pm.Worst experience.
"I placed an order with burger King on 5th June and later I received a call from delivery boy Lakhwinder Singh who Don't now how to speak with the customer and reached wrong address. Later I received a call mentioning that they don't deliver the item at my location it's far away, if you don't deliver at my place then why you took the order and the lady in the call center cancelled my order charging me cancellation fees for their own mistake. I was embarrassed infront of my friends, never use this service. (Your Swiggy order #169011546168 has been cancelled . You will be charged Rs 387.0 as cancellation fee.)"
"I ordered a cake of price 415,after some time they cancelled the order and told that i will get a different cake on that same price,but when the delivery boy came he took 385 rupees for that cake and told me that my previous order will be automatically cancelled and transaction will be done after few days but after 4-5days my transaction was not done and they said that they cut the whole price of the cake for their cancellation charge which I didn't do!"
Food are very delicious and testy. I love this food
ORDER was placed to deliver Cake. The cake was not delivered. The delivery person just placed the packet in front of the door took the snap and taken it back. When contacted the Swiggy expressed their inability to do anything in this respect and no refund is possible. A long dialogue with the company fetched no positive response. All they tell is they cannot do anything but swallow our money. They dont care for the reputation also. So beware of Swiggy before placing any order in future
"Is there Minus reviews i can leave ?I ordered a cake for my aunts birthday yesterday and paid Rs 535/- online, it was suppose to be a surprise. And Swiggy suprsed me, they cancel the order and decided to forefeight all the money stating their delivery guy could contact me. What ?? are you serious ? This looks like a scam.. so if you havent deliver the product , refund the money ? Who is holding my RS 535-/ Really feel cheated. Wont be going here every again"
I order food. The delivery guy goes to the wrong address. He calls me. I tell him. He doesn't speak English. I contact the customer support. They call me and tell me he is at the address. I tell them he is not and that I can see that he is a few blocks away. They cancel the order. I request a refund. They refuse and tell me that the delivery guy tried to deliver the food and it's out of their hands. In the end I am 30 dollars lighter and without food.
"I dont want anyone to trust thsi company.They always have new script and support team manupulates and dont answer users and dont want to solve their problem.Better you directly order from near by restaurants.They blame users instead providing solutions, wasted my money and I was so little embarrassed in front of my guests and the meantime i ordered meal directly from a restaurant."
Very poor service order was delivered very late and we had ordered mutton half they gave biriyani that too small piece of chicken which was not good at all took money for mutton handi given anything I will never order anything again  I will advise the same to other people and there is no one to listen to the complaints.
NEW STRATEGY OF SWIGGY TO LOOT INNOCENT CUSTOMERS !!!SWIGGY REMOVE CUSTOMER CARE NUMBERNOW THEY ARE HAVING RELATIONS SUBSTANDARD RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY CHAINS. IF YOU ORDER GROCERIES OR FOOD AND THEY ARE STALE YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING BUT LOOSE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. SWIGGY FRAUDULENT CHAT SERVICE WILL REJECT ALL YOUR COMPLAINTS AND NEVER REFUND. THEY WILL CHAT WITH YOU FOR HOURS AND ASKING DETAILS AND THEN WILL DENY THAT NOTHING IS WRONG STJ THE FOOD OR GROCERIES THEY SENT. VERY GOOD AND CLEVER MOVE BY FRAUDULENT SWIGGY. WE NEED TO BOYCOTT SWIGGY !!!
Absolute garbage. They destroy the evening. They lie about delivery partners and take hours to deliver. They don’t help online and they’re complete cheats
"I had ordered 3 portions of an item and received one, having no recourse to talk to someone I uploaded pics of the bill and the item on chat box and was given a paltry 79 rupees back. I called customer care spoke with an Meenakshi who was most unhelpful  and was told I could only complain within 24 hours. I am a paid member order Swiggy everyday and am totally disgusted with this service. SHAME you should not be treating customers this way."
"They scammed me for 670 rupees for a spilled food and refused to give money back or order replacement they are a worst andpathetic scammers , bycott them."
Wast app first time i order some resons i have to cancel my order still they charge how can u do this with u r first customer shamless think u have done plz do not ise this app i request
"I had ordered an Afghani champ roll and cold coffee on 3rd May'23 and the food was not delivered to me, however, the app showed that the food was delivered.I immediately bad rated the experience and validated the same with reason. Swiggy mentioned that my concern is received and it is being looked into.Today i.e. 4th may'23, I went to their chat portal about my concern and the chat support agent told me that I did not report the issue within 5 hours. I asked him what's the use of rating feature but the chat agent went numb and had no reply for this.Worst experience and be aware from them."
"Have the highest abusive team, every alternate delivery guy comes abuses and goes, somehow till building they'll come and call and speak rude till you go, while handling the food gives threats, there has been time when one guy put hand inside window to start a fight broke curtain because hands didn't reach to anything else, price is double on app, delivery fee is highest, customer support is higher than highest, don't know what these people are high on but never ever till date any issue has got a resolution only template response anything you ask same template is pasted, the moment they get 10 second chat delay end the chat itself, leave in between the chats, will never check history, in the name of different team or senior just pass the chat to next colleague who will again do the same thing provoke you make sure you go through the pain again and again till the time you start feeling depressed and lostI've kept a track of last 2 years their is a abuse or harrasment if you are lucky physical harrasments also will be delivered, you would complaint to them they will pass around the phone in name of team, support will make sure you get provoked and do something or get to a depressed stage, and finally lose the ticket on 2md day in the name of call it'll be misscall, or someone will call and speak faster than mutual fund ad and disconnectOver the last couple of years they've helped in increasing my stress to a level where feeling lost is small word, you would get tendency of not being alive at all, telling them not to call that is provoking thoughts more towards negetive side, high on what they have to call only, that intention even after telling so much he didn't stop, they depress and provoke you to a level, imagine having a life and death thought and these guys provoke more with their stupid communication and templates which will make you kill yourself, basically murderers they are, their delivery guys do crime legally like stealing, robbing threatens openly, when you complaint the depression and harrasments increases more.Biggest liars they did promise a compensation or they will help me go legal for the issues, if the inconvenience happens ever again, it happened today, no point for guessing template was sent 4 hours chat went, the guy just kept randomly sending template without even reading the issueNo one was bothered to go and check the previous complaints, only line sir we wil take action 48 hours and empathy"
The company policy and on the phone customer service is extremely helpful. Must laud it though sometimes those strange ones pop in who donot do what they say they will.2. The delivery people especially in Bangalore are terrible. Perhaps the culture among those people. Behave like we have forced them to deliver. Am sick of these people. Hope I don't need to order anymore. 3. The help and refund policies of the app is really helpful. Just push caution among those delivery thugs in Bangalore
The worst app.always half of the ordered items disappears till it comes to it's destination 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
I ordered today 27th April 23 from swiggy Instamart. they pack veggies Pooja flowers and chicken everything eggs together in one bag and in that no special wrapping for the frozen items. then the second back they mixed all the cold drinks cockroaches to spray together. is that kind of professional packaging they have that they should not mix the poisonous phrase and drinking beverages together ?I report the concerns to the customer care and they have taken me a unpleasant ride of investigation which not giving me any satisfactory response only I have receive the word sorry and we will look forward it and asking more photographs and details about the mess. It doesn't happen first time we are constantly sending them feedbacks and their thing only the returning the product particular money is this solution but this time they have cross the limits. And the kind of questioning they were done with me during the customer care support it was not a support it was completely torture and disappointment as usual. They never take feedback seriously and a continue with their things what the way they wanted so now I have decided not to order anything from instamart is better I to switch to an another apps.
"There was a time when swiggy was great. Today that's not the case. Ordered breakfast from the same place i do every week. I had guests over who had an early train journey and i had promised them great breakfast. That turned into a nightmare. They took the order and delivery guy on app showed standing in one place for 20 mins. Untill i didn't start fighting with their ""customer service"" on their ""help chat"" did any movement from the delivery guy show at all. Next calling delivery guy he claimed traffic issues at 8:30 am in the morning on a road which empty at that time. Wow. I asked for a refund for told i will be charged a cancellation fee. Means I'm out of luck. After arguing and threatening them that i will leave bad reviews for them on different platforms that's when they offered me a stingy 61 ruppee voucher. Told them I don't need their 61 ruppee charity and decided to post this review wherever i can because clearly Swiggy values it's customers and providing satisfaction at a mere 61 ruppees. Thanks but no thanks. Keep the 61 bucks clearly swiggy needs it more than i do."
I have been noticing the products provided are not of quality. I ordered eggs on 19h April and was given a packet of eggs which has expired on 4/4/23. Several times vegetables were rotten. I need action taken on this. There is worms in the egg.Very bad .
"Seriously swiggy is going to dogs. I often order grocery and other items, and many times things are either poor quality or given old batch products with dust and looks dirty. When I complained recently of a moisturizer which was 11/21 batch, asked them to replace with a new batch or atleast 2022 batch. But they completely denied. It’s a force buy, forcing to keep a 1 year 5 months old product. Bmvery bad. The other day I ordered 1kg bananas, and they sent overly ripped bananas which was smelling. And many such incidents. Vry bad. Very disappointed"
"I placed an order thru swiggy and It says delivered even before I got it.. I waited and when I tried to reach the delivery partner, no response. Spoke to customer support and supervisor from Swiggy, all they can Say is they can refund.. F.... yo, I will get my refund no matter what when I haven't got my order and I will make sure of that. what I'm asking is why the I was lied??"
"Order grocery and delivery partner cancel order without delivery order and 100% Cancel charges Deduct Swiggy.. very bed service and support staff also not helping ,"
"I have ordered and they canceled it because i did take their calls. And they say they cannot refund my money because i could not answer the calls. Its so lame. I haven't received a refund after talking to customer care. I Highly recommend people not to use swiggy. These days they are just making money by canceled orders. I dint understand Why should we pay for the order which is not received. We dint cancel, we pay and they cancel and take our money."
I ordered breakfast in the morning but the delivery agent went to the wrong address and after that I called the customer service and they said the location is different and they will have to cancel my order but for no reason they said they will not refund my money and my food can't be delivered... they said they have issues with the location...my query is when my address is saved there and my contact number is there then y to cancel my order? atleast they can refund half of the amount right?..i swear I didn't enter any location but they blamed me by saying that the location is not correct and the customer service provided me worst service and she was very sarcastic and rude with me and the delivery agent too was rude... I'm really upset and unhappy with the service because I lost my money and my time and my day started with a wrong note...i want to give them a zero... maybe zero is also a big number... actually I want to give negative numbers... Swiggy is a worst app...no value for money and worst service... very upset...I'm really not going to suggest this in my life...
"Delivery issue waiting since longtime, delivery boy went to wrong address and misbehaved with us.. later on asked to cancel order and deducted the amount from our account instead refunding  the total amount. I believe swiggy customer care is the worst team who dont know the resolve the issue. Instead of accepting the mistake they tried to blame the customer."
"I recently had a terrible experience with Swiggy. I placed an order and was unable to pick it up due to some issues, and since it was a prepaid order, I had to cancel it. To my horror, Swiggy charged me the full amount of the order as a cancellation fee, even though I had no way to pick up the order. This is a complete scam, and I would encourage everyone to stay away from Swiggy. Their customer service is non-existent, and they have no respect for customer rights. Stay away from this fraud company."
"This happened a week ago early hours on Saturday. I was quite angry with the delay and the robotic responses from your executives. However the way your senior escalation team member , I guess her name was maumita handled my concern in the most humane way possible made up for everything. The genuine responses from your valuable team member not only helped my predicament but also gave me a sense of comfort with swiggy. Nurture her as a great addition to your brand."
"I ordered food for my guests and children at home from Swiggy, the order was delayed for 2 hours. All the people were starving at home but still the swiggy team could not reply to us. Once the food arrived home it was all soggy and very bad, no one could eat it and we had to throw it out. After that I talked to customer service representatives. They were so annoying that they couldn't understand my problem and still they don't accept their mistake.I never thought the customer service people of this HUGE company ""SWIGGY"" could be so rough and heartless.If this continues I feel swiggy should stop working as there's no point in disappointing their valuable customer.From now on I'll order food from one of their best competitors as they have heard and they understand the problem."
I am seriously fade up swiggy coustomer supportNot able to resolve your complaintI have 4-5 issues which was not resolved
Very very very very very very very veryVery very very very very very very very  bad bad bad bad bad experience with this delivery boy ...very very very rude... Unprofessional ... He just behaviour is just like customer are nothing.. shame on you swiggy having such bad PPL your team...stop this nonsense PPL in your team... Also showing off his money that leaving 5 to 10 Rs/- on customer and having very big heart. Really unprofessional behaviour which is not acceptable at all...never recommended swiggy to have food from you... Really bad bad and bad experience. If you are a delivery shud be responsible persons to have at least 10 to 20 Rs/- change with them.
"Swiggy customer care very dishonest, not customer friendly.... Very bad experience with swiggy... Even swiggy software is not customer friendly, i am not much technology driven,  iam asking delivery boy to cancel order, he is telling u only cancel. Sometimes they should cancel directly than asking us to cancel.. All r not experts...they did not refund my money..... Very bad... I will tell my relatives and friends not to go for swiggy"
"I’ve ordered food around 9:50 and waited till 11:30Almost 2 hours and my order got cancelled.Around 10:30 it showed likeOn time delivery , will reach in 4 minsAnd I was expecting as my 2 years old were starving.I talked to 5 customer care executives just to make sure my order gets delivered because by the time every restaurant in my locality is closed.If only I didn’t chose Swiggy and trust them.My daughter and I slept on empty stomach.As I was spending just one night at my flat I didn’t had anything to cook or have.Bad service and they asked me to wait 10 minutes after every other 10 mins and finally it got cancelled.And all they say is “we understand and sorry for the inconvenience caused”“We’ll issue a coupon as complimentary”I said I don’t want your couponI can’t feed coupon to my baby and put her to sleep.I deleted the app and will never gonna use it.And so the coupon.Delivery executive already reported issues from their side as soon as they assigned him.But Swiggy failed to assign new delivery partner.And the customer care put my call on hold each time just to tell me that “we can’t reach the delivery partner”.I asked them to contact with restaurant before 11As it closes by 11:00.And I even told them I’ll go collect it by myself.They said order has been picked up by delivery partner.I told them don’t believe Whats showing on your screen as I believed “delivery in 4 mins” for 1 hour.I literally commanded to contact the restaurant and all they say is order is picked up.They even lied about contacting restaurant.They never did.Worst experience and I lost my time and energy."
"Not good service from Swiggy Pune city order#162044028584 Food delivered after a very big delay more than 1 hour today 16 mar 2023, and customer care refuse to refund just gave 1 email id to complain .They dont care bcoz the fault is from swiggy end and not from the restaurant."
Big issues with these clowns.  They have NIL idea about customer service.  I was told to accept cold food after waiting for their delivery partner to deliver a burger from less than 1km away.  Absolute joke.
"Today we have ordered food at 11.25am but not delivered till 01:20pm. Then finally, i cancelled my order. The worst thing is that swiggy was not even sorry for this"
Worst app i ever used. Wast of time and money. My order hasn't been delivered and costom care executive wasted more then 2 hours just wasted my time and money useless app please don't use swiggy any more i uninstalled it and won't use it again Any more
"Hopeless return policy as claimed by Swiggy Instamart. My order no. 136872783362734 consisting a pack of eggs. Swiggy sent me broken eggs but refused for replacement/refund. This company it cheating it’s customers by giving/advertising false and bugus policies. In a big country like India, this type of local companies are cheating their customers like this.They are also very prompt to sell their prime membership. After wasting my six hours by clicking pictures of the damaged item, chatting on swiggy app, sending mails etc. finally showed their helplessness and refused for any help."
Worst Behaviour in subash nagar By Manish...My Vehicle is Cycle they default add my vechile Bike and tell me Don't change ur vechile .... on Cycle i have got 8km above order distance...I am not using Bike and also don't Know How to drive Bike with No License..They tell me Dont work with swiggy...Worst Behaviour
We placed  order from Empire hotel kanakpura road which is just 7mins away from our place at nite 11.16pm..until 12.40 it kept showing delivery in 10 mins...12 mins ..but they suddenly thy cal and say it's vehicle break down and vcnt deliver ...its soo pathetic to not recive ur order on time wen guests are home and that too late nite..and this is not the first tym we are facing this problem with SWIGGY...it's worst..their service during nite times is pathetic...and the delivery partner is soo rude and dosent have sense to talk to customers....
Was ordering at night swiggy showed 15-20 mins left for restaurant to close but when tried placing order it showed restaurant closed but timer was still showing 15 mins left for restaurant closing
"dont order from swiggy,some good ratings restaurants will send some uncooked food ."
I ordered sezhwan Gobi fried rice ..I had to wait for more than an hour to get it..then I got the wrong one...which is mushroom..then I had to replace it..but guess what ? I got the wrong order again..I got paneer fried rice !! So careless and stupid !
Over pricingFake option of coupons100% bill amount being charged as cancellation charges
"Horrible customer service, dishonest and disappointing."
"Got two chatpata masala sachet(packet) sticked while eating double egg chatpata rolls! Disgusting experience from #faasos and #swiggy food.It was not mistake but it was done by full bad intention, while I was having my double egg chatpata roll i got two sachets of chatpata masala. When I got it first I just ignored it but after consuming little more, i got another packet sticked on roll. It was very bad experience till now. I heard that some bad type of people did some kind of bad things with customers food orders but this is the first time I have experienced. Today I got sachet in my food who knows  next time they serve with even more poor quality. So in one words say #no_to_swiggy_food anymore. Disgusting experience, very bad food quality, tasteless faasos, #faasos and #swiggy playing with the emotions of customers."
"Ordered dry snacks online, fortunately or unfortunately one item was not available and the vendor called to ask if the same can be replaced, since i wanted to see what else is available i checked their online site and found that the rates quoted there are much cheaper than that quoted on SWIGGY APP. Had ordered 8 items and each was priced Rs.20/- more than the actual price. i took the matter up with SWIGGY but besides apologies they were not ready to refund the extra amount...feel CHEATED BY SWIGGY"
Please guys dont order anything from swiggy.Its better to order from Zomato.I ordered noodle from swiggy but there was no portion was mention as if no portion is mentioned its fact that order is for full. But the send half portion and taken a money of full portion. When i mailed to swiggy they are just keep on repiting only one thing just rate hotel not giving any return. And not taking any action on hotel. Stop using this app all fraud is going on in swiggy. Even hotel will send a portion in a swall tea cup also the swiggy will say we can't refund jist giving rating to hotel. Stop using Swiggy its better to use zomato insted of swiggy.
Worst experiencePlease don't use swiggyToday I booked veg mushroom  biryani and waiting for almost 70 minute I didn't recieved my order.After 10 minutes he reached home he was delivered successfully but when I was opened the order that is non veg biryani.
Worst experiencePlease don't use swiggy genni app.. they are fraudToday I booked genni and waiting for almost 40 minute because the delivery partner was not assignedIf they don't have sufficient staff to deliver then why they started this serviceAnd there's no option to chat with help centerReally very disappointed
"I ordered late night snack through swiggy instamart. They promised to deliver in 20 minutes. But even after an hour, there is no delivery agent to pick. I requested Swiggy agent to deliver it. But they are adamant to cancel it. The amount of frustration they create to a customer is immeasurable"
"Second time on the loop i got my pizza in a very bad condition, i mean second in a row, really! And don't you guys provide boxes to the delivery partner as the guy brings the pizza in a backpack second time inna row even though i experienced at first and rated you guys with my first issue but still second inna row can't you guys learn form the mistakes. Zomato is far better. Oh and then just after i ordered the same order through zomato and i noticed that zomato has it's box container with fully insulated which was quite awsome to keep the pizza hot and smooth"
Very bed experience not refund after 15 day's left
Amazing experience & good delivery service. Packaging was also impressive. Would love to order again. Recommended!Thanks a lot!
"No use talking to them just a waste of money and time. The instamart is worse as first it is never instant and 2nd they have no control of the quality of products sent to us. Most of the  customer service is untrained,useless  and has no wish to help. Just deleted the app  and started using zomato and big basket."
"Firstly, Swiggy chat help in Swiggy app is so ridiculous that when I reported this issue, they told me to email to swiggy. Then why is Swiggy help chat present? In reference to the order number- 156966852962The brownie quality was very bad as it has become very hard to eat. The smell of the brownie is also very bad here. When I reported Swiggy about this they spoke like robots literally without a basic human interaction and told me to email. Is this how you send a low quality brownie? Is this how ridiculous Swiggy is coordinating with the restaurant. Sending such cheap quality items and how much does Swiggy cheaters hold a share in this? Its been 2 days and I haven't received any response from swiggy email or swiggy app and I finally exposing these chetaers deactivated my swiggy account and uninstalled it."
"Swiggy people are playing a new game these days, which probably many customers are not even aware of. If the customer orders anything, then they cancel that order by giving some reason and then collect the cancellation charge from the customer. But now the time has come to tell them their status."
"Earlier swiggy served well but now it is taking customers with paid subscription as high fraud and have changed technical scenario that while customers try to order form reputed restaurants during peek hours of service they mark all delivery executives busy in area making order unserviceable or give you high service hours. If you select high service hours they do not assign delivery partner till service centre is contacted under I want to cancel my order or their bot goes on fooling you under where is my order. Later they give empathy statements and do not take ownership or pay any refund or fine. Swiggy will loose the market very soon. If you contact service centre they mark customer high fraud without understanding authenticity of the complaint. Swiggy has turned to be a big fraud selling food not service and making various tax frauds as well. Do see the taxes before applying discount and after discount that increases after discount without explanation in inventory. They charge margin on food items, just compare rates at counter and on swiggy menu and even additional delivery charges l, so how can they say they are not responsible, they reselling open food withouth Govt License.

"I ordered 3 packs of VEG PULAO for Rs 420 on SWIGGY on OCTOBER 20, 2022 (Order No.: 149323092294). When I unpacked everything and sat down to eat the pulao, the pulao was stale and unpleasant in smell. I raised a complaint on SWIGGY. SWIGGY gave me a refund of ONLY Rs 15, whereas 3 packs of VEG PULAO cost me Rs 420!!!Despite several emails, SWIGGY kept saying that the compensation had been provided. The customer care didn't understand the simplest thing--Rs15≠Rs 420. I've provided below the final response from the Swiggy Customer Care Team for you to decide whether to place orders on SWIGGY.I urge everyone to refrain from placing orders with SWIGGY. SWIGGY initially had fair refund policies, but now even if you've missing items, it won't give you a single rupee back.--------------------------------------------------Dear Customer,Greetings from Swiggy!We would request you to accept the refund and consider it a rare and one-time occurrence.As the compensation has been already provided, we will no longer be able to compensate for the same.Your disappointment is understandable however, we see that you have been associated with us for quite some time and we request you to give us another chance to serve you better. Please do not lose your hope in us.We do value your relationship with us and hope to serve you better in the future.Please feel free to contact us at swiggy support for any further queries.Warm Regards,Ashlay.Swiggy Support Team."
It's the worst delivery service. They have some how managed to slow down their clock. If they say it will take 30 mins it will actually take 45 mins. But on their app it will still show that it's ontime. This is a fraud activity cheating their customers
My order didn’t got delivered in 50 mins(It was supposed to come within 25mins)& Without any information they cancelled my order and initiated refund after 50 mins. They didn’t even bother to call.And when I asked for reason they offered me ₹100 coupon as that can make for everything..My kids were waiting for that order and they got upset..I have seen these issues before but now decided to uninstall it.
Customer Service is getting  bad daily.I got a bad cake and was told they will make sure it won't happen again and didnt even refund.
Useless customer service. It’s like taking to freakin wall. And when the Order gets messed up they won’t compensate for anything. Happened many times and response is still same. Complete fraudulent service
"I ordered from Ovenstory for the 1st time, and I had lots of hopes. I paid almost 800 rupees which I never did with Dominos or Pizza Hut, as I used to order small size pizzas. However, this time I thought to try something new and chosen Ovenstory. As a customer I deserve to get what I paid for, the experience was not upto the mark. Ovenstory did not 'Standout' in terms of taste as pizzas felt soggy, chicken pieces were dry not juicy as they should have been. Ovenstory did 'Standout' in not being able to pack the order to ensure that they do not get torn into pieces while the Swiggy guy took 45+ minutes to deliver it. Packaging charges applied, but not sure for what as there were not paper tissues, nor markings on the boxes for which was which pizza as I order 1+1 and if they were vegetarian or non-vegetarian. I hope that I don't get too excited like this again, in trying something new and only order from my go to places like Dominos and Pizza Hut. 'Swiggy & Ovenstory' 👎🍕🗑️"
The supply chain and the support team are hand in glove to swindle money. They have cancelled the order and claim user has cancelled it when there is no way user can cancel in app. A clear case of fraud
"We experienced fraudulent services from Swiggy. We ordered with the buy one, get one"" offer. But we only received 1 pack from each order. However, we complained to their team. still there here is no good response from their side. Don't order from this worst app."
Bad food And if you contact me i will share pictur and details
"So I faced a technical issue(which was confirmed by the support staff himself). I was told it would be solved within 2 days. Upon seeing it was not resolved I contacted the customer support again and another staff was appointed but the staff was an idiot. She just kept repeating that this was not an issue,when given proof from another account she kept saying that the app is dynamic and what not. How are they supposed to help when they themselves do not know the functions of their app and services provided. I contacted the support many times after that. Even after a month the problem remains unsolved.They just keep saying they will get back to me."
"Swiggy charged me for food from a restaurant which was closed 2.5 hrs ago. Kept me hanging for 2 hours saying that your order will be delivered. I trusted this lousy app and didn’t order from any other place. Took my money, peace and appetite these bunch of liers."
"I can't tell you how annoyed I am with my today's interaction with SwiggyI placed order: #154099214606. I love this shop and order quite often from them; however, whenever I order, some or the other items go out of stock, and then I am directed to the Swiggy Customer care team to give further directions (replace the item/ get a refund or cancel the order). I was unable to do it on my own so I chose to chat with Swiggy customer care. I started Chatting with Koushik. This guy tormented me on the chat by keeping me waiting for 40 mins and giving no resolution. Below is my horror story with the chat agent:1)	He showed clear signs of disinterest as he was late to reply and I had to follow up with him on the chat.2)	Instead of helping me he chose the easy way out by offering to cancel the whole order thrice on the chat conversation and I declined every single time3)	He kept on apologizing for keeping me waiting but did nothing to offer a resolution4)	I gave up and asked for someone else to help me, but he kept me waiting for that as well5)	Later in the chat conversation I might have demanded 10 times to be put through a manager and all he did was ask me for a second chance to help (in fact it was to keep me waiting for more)6)	At I point it was clear to me that he was purposely keeping me waiting, I think he enjoyed it/ was frustrated/disinterested. 7)	I kept telling him to be quick and all he did was ask me to wait. 8)	Later when I threatened him that I will leave a Bad review for Swiggy, he asked one of his colleagues Aarti to call me (she disguised herself as a manager, as she lacked every bit of managerial quality)9)	Aarti was just like Koushik, unwilling to listen and offer a resolution. She kept repeating in a very typical call center tone that they are very sorry and will be giving feedback to the agent (she did not even know the name of the chat agent for whom she had called me. She sounded like Factory made, scripted call center agent10)	Later when I told her that its no longer about my order (which by the way at this point was delayed by an hour, all thanks to Koushik for stalling it) and asked Aarti some difficult questions, all she did, was to hang up on me.11)	Later when I asked Koushik, how is Swiggy compensating me for the lost time, he said that they can offer a refund of 271 on my Swiggy Account, I reluctantly agreed to later find its not refunded to me as promised. Wow! Kudos to Swiggy for having such gems in their organisation to avoid, disrespect, and offer below-standard customer service. I am never ordering from Swiggy and would appeal others to save themselves from the torment and torture that they may go through, just like me."
"Swiggy is literally cheating the customer, many times we ordered the food and 1 or 2 food items were missing in order, though we inform them. they are skipping to refund it. many times I informed them but they are refuge to solve the issue. they simply say sorry.Recently also I faced the same issue. It's better I'm going to stop this usage swiggy app."
"Order No. 153849892887.#Worst Experience of ordering a leftover order# The Delivery guy (Shahbaz Kazi) had eaten 7 pieces out of the 10 pieces in an otherwise complete order. I registered a complaint on the Customer care and they had issued a partial payment which after 20min more of my agonizing time on call, resulted in full payment refund.... (still to be credited back to my original payment mode) I again got a same order from Zomato, packed and delivered in pristine condition. (reference Pic attached). Threw away the Swiggy leftover items, the app in my phone and also the trust over the company, in the garbage bin.This had been my last # No Thanks Swiggy #153849892887"
"Order No: 153163361530The below items never reached me, the delivery person came on a cycle and was clueless about the order.

SWIGGY DENIED TO REFUND MY HARD-EARNED MONEY.9825007547"
I wish I could give a negative star. They Delivered rotten food and it seems from the same restaurant if go personally you will get better food but due to profit sharing issue they delivery bad food in online order
Swiggy is one of the worst app just cheating the public by encourage bad restaurant they suplying bad food to customers to response from customers assistance
"I wrote a review for them on Google play and these guys deleted the reviewSeriously you guys try to delete a review just show how pathetic you are. You guys gave did the mistake and now just blatantly deleted the review. Also, to all who read this do not even bother to reply for feedback mails they are going to repeat the same things that their so-called customer service executive says. First, they do not give you food and then they do not give you refund. And they actually deleted the review. The audacity is just over the roof. Don't download it's a scam. Would -5 stars if it was possible"
"I'm a swiggy restaurant partner and swiggy has literally scammed us in the name of promotions. They charge you 6.2+gst per clicks to the restaurant page for promotion and we got only very few orders. we worked hard for 2weeks and on checking the payout it was in negative (-2,200)It was a huge loss for us as we strongly believe that these clicks were automated by some bot."
"The most worst online food delivery service... Last Saturday i ordered food at 9.40 pm then it shows ""it will take 15 mins to deliver"", then after 15mins it was showing ""20 mins to deliver"" then after 20 mins again the same thing... At 12.45 am the swiggy cancelled my oder ....... The swiggy service should be banned..it should be closed as early as possible...."
I order the food at 11:45 and it was 1:30am and I didn’t got my order. Such horrible service they give also when I complaint about it they weren’t responding and only said wait your order will reach. Guys if you want your order on time then never order from this app!!
Swiggi is a institution of how to  frade a people they do wrong thing and pay you for this
Didn’t deliver anything and not even refunding.Very strange as I am sure as per law you are required to refund for something you didn’t send or deliver.
Horrible experience with Swiggy. Order never got delivered even though I already paid for the order. I never got the money back of the undelivered order 😤. Such a waste of time and money 😔😔😔
Very bad services in Hyderabad old bowenpally
Pathetic serviceThey don't send all items and give no refund.Waste of time and money
"Worst customer service , Rohit  and Arun.. wrong product delivered and no replacement done .. Is this how you earn money Every time wrong order gets delivered .. this is my third instance Order instamart : 124164121654980"
The package was handled carelessly by the swiggy delivery boy so that the food delivered was not hygiene and too cold to eat
"@swiggy, you fool everyone, customer troubles can be solved by chat or on call so why do you say for mail and when mail to you, your special team replies that send clear image that  after 14 to 15 hours, is it possible. And at the end you said that we're sorry for not being able to help you... that means you've lost both your time and money...... @zomato better than that. You really are the dump company."
Swiggy customer care number O7OO18.18O22 all problem solve any time available 24+7days available online customer service
The worst service ever. tried ordering 2 rolls from it and first had to wait for 30 minutes and after that just cancelled my order.
This is the worst food delivery App. Please opt for Zomato as they are extremely professional and don't steal or hold up your money. Swiggy customer support team is a joke and so is the owner🤣🤣🤣.
"Going to uninstall swiggy,no one is answering the phone, order not coming still waiting it's more than 1 hour"
"I orderd a pizza and chocklate Sundae from ""SWIGGY ONLINE DELIVERY"" The DELIVERY AGENT GANESH with Executive ID ""169525""has not delivered and he has eaten himself and updated in App that its delivered. When i called Swiggy the executive ""SUHAIL"" dint give anyresolution except a SORRY. IS this the way online services are working are the customers are fool?Their mistakes why customers should bear?Why we should be hungry because of him?Why these people employee these type of idiot delivery guys?"
"The are the worst, just looking to loot people. They will charge you , then not deliver your order . then they will not even agree to there mistake and refund your money back to you."
Swiggy customer care chat is pathetic and useless. They don't care of customer issue and don't even try to understand and solve the same. Very bad experience
Used swiggy genie to send cakes and biscuits to my nephew.the delivery agent didn't even hear any last mile instructions. Didn't deliver it after 6hrs also.the swiggy chat is useless .they told me agent is not receiving calls.the packet is just lost and nobody is responsible!!!
We use swiggy instamart in Hyderabad. Off late they send rotten veges/ fruits in double packing.On complain within an hour too no refund / replacement is initiated .They keep chatting non stop with sorry and we want to improve so we will investigate and our team will get back in 6 working hrs .Past 2 days all chats ends with this note !! No help No emails No calls thereafter !!Better to go to ur local grocers and give them some business...save urself from falling prey to this nuisance service where everything is Instant when u need to pay and once the order is delivered everything after service help is not Instant any more .Sales team is not at all bothered to help infact I guess they r there to just keep dragging the issue on chat box  till customer is fed up and let's go .Terrible customer service!!
"On 04/10/2022 I ordered mutton biriyani from Hyderabad city restaurant named LUCKY it served me stale biriyani where I can clearly feel smell and rigidness of meat, I contacted them through SWIGGY help they simply replayed me like we cant do anything regarding about food it is totally restaurant fault, these guys cant take responsibility of food that provided by restaurant that listed on their company disgusting, I will never deal with this company in near future."
I order samosa plates worth 120rs and order in office and delivery partner said your order is 20RS I will not deliver to office come down and take it how rude he is will never order from swiggy
"Bunch of scammers. They will deliver stale food that could cause you food poisioning. They will only claim to give refund but the amount will never reach your account. They lie about everything!! Bunch of dishonest, petty people who can't be trusted at all. Stay away and save your money."
"Order was not delivered even after one n half hour of ordering. Call was not received by the delivery boy. When tried reaching to customer care number, they cancelled the order. We had to sleep hungry that night."
This food delivering app should be shut down and punished for delivering expiry food products n stale fooditems...on reporting for expiry food product they hav got a Ryle of 72 hours to report but no rule for more than a month expired food item
"They are simply looters and scammers. I guess we all already know they Mark up each item by 20 - 50 Rs. Increase the price even on things like one single pav. But today they went too far. I was sent a half eaten tub of Baskin Robbins ice cream and when I asked for a refund they said they can't and that they will ""try to reduce"" such instances from happening again. Seriously? I paid 76 Rs ""taxes and charges"" on this. They charge rain fee even when it's not raining. And they deliver disgusting half eaten products and don't fix the issue. I would rather walk the roads of Mumbai in the rain and get my food myself from now on."
Worst service. The delivery man calling me and saying the road is blocked.. can't come.. will have to cancel it.. whereas i myself went by that road after a couple of minutes to find no road block. Worst people. Zomato is much better
"Today, 10 September 2022,we ordered a paneer tikka and nan from waltair kitchen. Before also twice we ordered from same place in the last three months. But today whoever actually cooked the dishes, hats off to the person. Also there was freshly made gajar ka halwa. Awesome. They say u don't forget good food and bitter words. This dish was so amazing, god bless the chef."
"Worst experience, did found 2 items missing in delivery package, and support person was not kind enough to listen and resending missing items."
"This is the worst delivery aap that I have ever used, 5days before I purchased different flavors of lays aand all were smelling bad and the taste was ewww.. my husband suffered from stomach infection after eating and after complaining I have not yet received any solution. They keep on saying that supervisor will call you and you'll get a solution within 6 hours but they are liars don't trust them. I will suggest all to please do not use this aap as they are not trust worthy at all."
Horrible experince multiple times. Most of the time misplaces the orders.Better to visit resturants than odering from them.
They have a pathetic customer service chat team who does not even understand or read through the customers query.. I dnt have option to upload the screenshot or I must have done that
"Worst delivery serviceI had booked an order on instamart. It showed delivery time as 35 minutes. The order got delivered to me after 1 hour and 15 minutes. When I spoke to the customer service agent somnath sahoo, he mentioned that he was trying to call me, now the phone was in my hand and there was no call from their end. So they lie also. The worst ever kind of service"
"Worst service. Issues will not be resolved. 1st they ask for text, then call where we have to wait for more than 15to 20mins and later problem will not be sorted. Instead they will ask to mail. It's not once it's twice happened with me."
Ordered food. The app kept on giving incorrect info. Called the delivery guy who said his bike was punctured. Waited for the food. Called after sometime as there was no change in the app info. He gave a lame excuse and hung up. Called customer care and they arranged someone else. They called me after 10 minutes to state that the restaurant is closed and they will refund the money. All this happened at 11pm. I am really frustrated at this service and this is not the end. I will definitely use other social media tools to show how good the service is.
"As usual the service of Swiggy has been worst, today 21st Aug 2022 i placed an order 8.15pm and I was supposed to get in 30 mins, but received a call after 1.15 mins and informed me that my order will take another 20-30 minutes. With this it is quite evident that these fellows unable to manage their business and charging exorbitant prices in the name delivery charges and surge, this is nothing but looting."
"Delivery guys dont have common sense they are just hurry to throw the food wherever they want many a times they keep it near footwear even without asking permission, Inspite of telling the customer support team about this issue, the same mistake is been repeated again and again by delivery boy"
I thought to give 0  but there is no option worst experience i have order at 1:35 and finaly i received my order at 3:20   worst experience  i don't want to order again in swiggy
Swiggy you have a really bad service I was ordering a menu and you suddenly discharged it due to high demand you took the board of 5 demand and you said that was a discrimina that we don't have enough people and all over my heart basis delivery so that's your problem I want my food and you can't deliver it just close your app Zomato is for better than your
"Very bad experience always I face with swiggi their delivery partners dnt call and are very rude too and today I had loss of 100rs as my order got cancelled and swiggi dint returned my full amount my order was of 200rs they refund only 100rs,I really not going to use swiggi this happened with me twice"
They provide stale and burned food..don't even refund proper full money..these are just money lynching peopel
Swiggy is not good because I ordered kfc and didn't deliver and delivery partner number is switched off  and it happens with me  4 time so swiggy delivery partner are not serious they don't give dame about your order and swiggy is not taking seriously  so start unistall swiggy
Like to give 0 star pathetic service even customer care is also hopeless.
Delivery guy vanished with food. Did not pick up calls. Kids kept waiting for food. The app kept showing 7 mins for delivery for 2 hours. When we called support they just gave option to cancel the order and talking the same thing like a robot. They conveniently and forcibly cancelled our order. It was such frustrating experience with the guests and kids waiting for food. And finally we ended up with no food after 2 hours.
Requesting to all not use swiggy for food delivery. My name is Koushik from Kolkata. Their delivery partner eates food on the way. Swiggy doesn't not refund money. In swiggy money they will ask your PAN number. Dont give PAN number.
Worst experience .Didn't deliver to my address .worst worst worst service .Deducted money - complete for cancellation fee .
Worst experience as I'm delevery boy off swiggy I did not get my incentive on time. There is no other person to who i can contact for any issues. didn't response on time. Everytime when I am complaining about something they always fool us and makes excuses for each and everything.Even executive also not responding on time. Management is poor. No contact no is exist I think fir calling only we can do text on their own site. How can we contact if we have any issues.?very disappointed 😞
Poor conversation with an agent they are not even helping with the order i don't know why they are working as a customer care
Pathetic service. Today I had ordered food at 9:26pm and at 11:30pm after waiting for 2 hour they called me asking their inability to deliver as their delivery boy was not reachable. The restaurant was ready with the food from 9:45pm but nobody reached for pickup.
I must say number one frauds. I ordered food and paid through gpay but food was not delivered and it showed food delivered which didn't happen. When tried calling delivery man he didn't pick call. Call center people r very rude.
I ordered from swiggy and got wrong item after many calls on customer care they ask me to e-mail support now u guys not imagine what they said kindly ma'am go to fssai food licence to report for restaurant for wrong item received really this is how swiggy helped pathetic ordered from Jaipur rominos pizza
Worst ever experience. I am based at Patiala in Punjab and Ordered Noodles for my kids from a local restaurant. The food was so oily that it looked like a noodle curry and on top it was so spicy that my kids didn't even eat first bite. I contacted this useless swiggy customer support and after talking for half an hour they offered my 76rs refund.i had paid 378 rs for the food. I didn't take the refund asked them to wait for the day when they would get served from one such rubbish restaurant from their town and they will feel the heat. Most unprofessional and unethical team
Their delivery is pathetic.Even after putting the exact location in address they are unable to find the area and simply wastes time and money of the customers.
Swiggy instamart is the worst app for customer support Pl BeWare!!!
"I have ordered food and it got delivered very quickly and the food has no salt of course they will ask for pictures after sending the pictures their reply will be like their experts will review and respond within 4 to 6 hours. And their reply:""Having gone through your email, we see that you reported having received poor quality food on this order. Since the restaurant is solely responsible for the preparation of the food, we will be unable to compensate you for this issue.Having said that, you may rate the restaurant on the app, as this impacts their business directly and they are likely to be pulled into action seeing the same.Thank you for taking the time to write to us regarding this issue.""But my friend also ordered from the same swiggy app and she also had quality issue but they refunded her immediately. And they are not ready to compensate on my order. And am also paying them money. I don't know why they do this to me.This is not my only experience I faced ordered with few orders and the reply is again the same thing. If I go to a restaurant and if the food is not good I will have an option to return it immediately. Since am ordering through swiggy am coming back to you if I have any issue. And they are least bothered."
Please never order from here.product are damaged and they out of date.. very much disappointed from there service....
Swiggy customer service made me do multiple orders and none of them arrived .Even the app showed order delivered.They are just fooling customers and treat them like waste
"Swiggy is clubbing every delivery with another order near by, which is increasing delivery time, making it impossible to deliver on time the app has initially promised. Gross violation of consumer rights"
Worse experience with swiggy. Very unprofesaional attitude of awiggy customer care. very bad executive hope not to order any more with swiggy.BAD ATTITUDE
i ordered from haldiram chandrapur so it took me 2 hours till i came and the delivery boy had no eid prof he came himself
Good Delivery Service in my area
Swiggy insta mart is the worst . Never order from them . I had ordered vegetables thrice all three times they send rotten vegetables . I had ordered chips recently . The goods delivered were in expired packets and had fungus inside . I am never ordering from them again .
"SWIGGY CUSTOMER CARE -  A BUNCH OF CHEATSI ordered food through swiggy and a punched in my address.later on I got a phone call from delivery boy and I found that food was sent in some other location. When I pointed out  the correct address put in by me in the apps of swiggy and requested him to deliver in my address, he simply cancelled my order. I immediately contacted customer care and it was my worst experience.the food was never delivered but they persisted that the order was actually cancelled by me. The customer care told me that even if I punched my correct address , the map continued to show some other address. the map is in some other screen and when someone punches the address no one actually again verify it with the map or there is no system in there apps where customer must also confirm the location from the map.It is clearly a fault in their apps which the customer care of Swiggy agreed that they will rectifyBut I suffered and my money was never refunded.Such is the quality of service that swiggy has been given now. Worse experience"
Swiggy delivery man delivered our order to another address. We couldn’t get hold of him and neither could Swiggy customer service. I was put on hold and transferred several times and wasted half hour talking to staff who only knew how to say sorry but take no responsibility.We waited for an hour and then wasted half hour arguing on the phone offering a Rs 300 token for delay! And then another hour for re-ordering. They would not be compensating for the inconvenience but on top of that staff pretended not to hear and disconnected the call.This is 11.30pm at night and waiting for another hour still.
I use swiggy more than any other food delivery apps. What I love the most is their UI.
"Poor quality service promised to deliver food in 1 hour but after 1.5 hour no response. when being asked customer care said it will take another 1 hour to deliver food. Now its late night, even if i want order food there is no place that is open. they offered a coupon but at late night i have no food to eat. Didn't accept the coupon."
"Swiggy will not be able service customers any more, since most of their employees do not speak the truth nor provide any resolution on issues caused by Swiggy and that has tampered the reputation of the companyTry Zomato, Amazon food or Dunzo"
my sister(kopuri pavithra) who is working in CLEVERTAP as an employee is tracking all my locations from  which locations I'm ordering and what food I'm eating which leads to looking into my privacy data without my permission therefore swiggy team please look into this where personal life and professional life should not me combined and say her to stop tracking my locations
This is the worstfood delivery company in the industry. Zomato and Uber eats were so good. Swiggy better consider exiting the industry. Worst service and worst delivery executives. The swiggy boss should be a money hungry maniac who is impotent to serve the customers. :)
"Swiggy FraudThe delivery partner cancelled my order not only i took his call, made a swigy executive speak with him to explain my address. And they charge 100% cancellation fee for the failure of their own partners and executives to deliver a paid order. The customer service executive are mean and extremely unprofessional. Swiggy has detoriated... Sorry to see the standards it has stopped down to"
"Their delivery time doesn't deserve a dime. There are constant delays, high taxes and delivery fee despite being a super member and most items are missing or wrong!"
I received the order opened....no swigy tap was there....worthless delivery
Placed and order at 3:30 now the time is 5clk .. didn't received order 138016204157 ...trying to reach delivery boy not getting any response ..escalated to swiggy customer care getting response pls cancel the order ..that's what we get service from swiggy....worst service I have ever faced ...  Need my money back apart from compensation
Last time i'm ordered one chicken burger they delivered veg ill complain also no response its very bad that's why ill uninstall swiggy app ....that's very disappointed
"I ordered biryani by applying coupon code, and discount applied and show less amount. then there is option proceed to pay, i selected pay option as per the discount coupon mentioned.then discount amount is added to the actual amount. i thought they will return amount as cash back as mentioned in the coupon and paid.I have not received refund, when i check with customer care they are saying you have not applied coupon.Is there any app which will ask coupon code twice ?Customer Care service people no use they always stand on what they want to say to the customer, they never listen and understand the issue and escalate to the concern department."
Very very warast delivery boys and Zomato is better plg dot order call me castmer car i have a reason
Service is becoming awful and they are always charging  surcharge fee due to rain when there is no rain. They are trying to charge extra unnecessary.
Not even deserve 1 start. This is for the 3rd time that I have experienced the worst service from swiggy. Some Mr Andhale accepted my order this time at 9.07 pm. I received it @ 11.26 pm. Wow what a service. No words to express.
I ordered cold drink soda and other item too they delivered warm hot beverages to me and no humanity there they said I will escalate other then other person same dilogue punch i said I'm suffering from stamoch pain they denied to me my amount and spoiled my time money it's my last ordered before that o thought it's very good but know I can see it's totally fraud they took money previously and do not provide money back i will case in consumer court
I ordered for biryani. Time was 41 minutes. Guess what time I got it. After 1hour and 46 minutes. My oor daughter drank milk and went to sleep. Pathetic and unsavory services.
I ordered masala dosa from Mr and Mrs Idly. I order my food on 10:00 pm but unfortunately my order didn't came to my home location and swiggy cancelled my order. I called him for like 2 to 4 times but the delivery partner didn't pick up my call. They didn't send me any cancellation charges. I'll didn't recommend swiggy to order food online.
I just ordered lunch from RGPunjab Spice restaurant in Tragad Ahmedabad.I found dead cockroach in my cucumber salad 😡🥺Reported to Swiggy but no action only kept on saying Sorry.Need to be careful while ordering on Swiggy
"Worst delivery management services. Delivery person doesn't know to behave. Impolite, food packaging was worst."
Swiggy is a just superb. Love their UI
"They deserve rating in negative but unfortunately there is no such option.I place an order on 20th may , order number: 136104956252 for Rs 2700. After waiting for more then a hour when we called up restaurant, we were told that the rider mentioned customer cancelled the order and the restaurant did not have any more information. They advised to contact swiggy. When we contacted swiggy they advised that teh rider waited for 20minutes at the address and tried calling up .this was such a fraud. I never received any call nor the rider came to our address. We were all waiting outside.  When I asked swiggy to show me proof( snapshot of rider at my location or proof of call)they refused to provide the information for security reasons.I kept insisting that the rider never called on the number I gave while booking and the rider never arrived,they said they can refund Rs 700 out of Rs 2700 that I paid. This is such a scam on customers like me. The rider can be irresponsible and never try to deliver for whatever reasons and the only sufferer is customers like me. I refused to take the Rs 700 refund as this was completely unethical and unprofessional from swiggy. They do not care about the customers. There is no policy to safeguard the customers rights. I will report this to consumer forum aswell. Please try to share whatever agree with me and let everyone know the scams that are going on with swiggy. #swiggy.com #swiggyceo #swiggygoabranchmangaer"
Horrible experience. We re waiting for our Swiggy order from Dominoes since 9 pm and Swiigy executive has the temerity to say the problem is not theirs but Dominoes.Highly unprofessional and cheats. We re still waiting.....its a total rip off
I ordered instamart today and the rider who was incompetent to trace the location misbehaved with me and refused to deliver the products. So I initiated a chat on their help desk and another incompetent guy Dikshant told me that your product is already delivered. I told him that no I didn’t receive the delivery. He took on con call with the rider and the rider very rudely said that he has already delivered and that I am lying. I told him that my building has cameras and that I can prove I didn’t receive the delivery whereas I am trying to get the delivery since so long and that is why I am on chat with swiggy helpline. The swiggy helpline was also incompetent and without compensating me for all the harassment and trouble they simply said we can utmost refund the original sum and that’s what we can do. I wasted more than an hour on this and a rider accused me of taking the goods whereas I didn’t receive any and I was trying to get in touch with the rider whereas he was disconnecting my call. The rider seemed a frustrated man- god knows he could stab me if he had come to deliver the product. I want everyone reading this to take it seriously and that Swiggy is doing good fraud in the name of E commerce.
"The worst food app. Order khud cancel kar k refund b ni dete … Cutomer service is worst and unbearable… i ws regular customer of swiggy, i almost ordered everyday … but they did bad things repititvely, dats y i deletd this ghatiya app"
"I'm really happy with the quality of food I've received from Swiggy. The delivery is always fast and the food is delicious and healthy. The delivery agent is also friendly and helpful. Overall, I'm very satisfied with Swiggy and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good food delivery service."
"I always keep having bad experience with Swiggy company. They are good for nothing. I have been cheated thrice by them so stopped using the app for few years but in recent case I thought to give try so I requested for Swiggy genie service on 9th may 2022 also the payment was successfully done through gpay the balance deducted but even after charge in app it reflects transaction failed and no service received. So, I contacted to chat support for refund and since last three days they playing games send this mail that mail and giving all false commitments but no solution till date. Even though I mail them with proof of payment. Also, today when I contact chat support for update again same thing they are asking me to do send an email with bank statement all they are doing is playing you round & round. Also, this not the first time happening to me with Swiggy it’s third time. Now it’s like they are fraud. I came across many different websites were  reviews for Swiggy are shared and guess what majority reviews were negative marking and 1star rating, I read every single review  I’m not surprised reading them. Swiggy lacks in every department. If Swiggy continues same ways no wonder to say goodbye from market. Zomato is way far better. Good bye Swiggy enjoy your failure."
"Swiggy u really need to work on your delivery partners.You hire cheap labour and the customer has to bear the brunt.Your delivery boy Aftab Shaikh in Mumbai was uncouth and yelling over the phone on top of his voice.He was totally at fault by not following the instructions & he has the audacity to tell me to come and pick up my order from him.Seriously??After asking him to leave the order at the doorstep and not ring the bell,like a fool he keeps ringing the door bell and goes away without delivering the order and bloody lies that the order has been delivered on the app.Your customer service team didn't bother to call and escalate this matter and bcoz of your useless customer service support these ruthless,uncouth riders go scott free.Totally disgusted!!!!😡😡"
Food was decent and well prepared. On-time delivery was also well appreciated. The rider's could use some training to avoid calling so often.
"Cheater company, I order food and paid 194 Rs and they not delivered the order and cancel the order and took my money.My order Number is #134915520298.Total fraud company"
My experience was very bad with Swiggy. They charged the food which was not delivered to me and ask me to provide negative feedback to the restaurant. Their customer support was not up to the mark. Recommend others not to use Swiggy.
"My sister ordered some food on April 10th and due to some technical issue on Swiggy's part, she was told that the order was canceled, so she ordered the food again but then she was told that the initial order was not canceled. When she tried to cancel one of the repeat orders, she was told that she cant cancel and she was asked to pay for both orders. She payed. Then yesterday she ordered something and they canceled her order and refunded her money. So when we cancel an order, they take the full amount but when they cancel our order, neither do we get anything and they don't have any consequences. How is this customer service???"
So i had ordered from kfc and 4piece chicken were missing. And when swiggy was notified alond with the images they say 'claim cannot be substantiated and nothing can be done'. For a missing item how do you expect the customers to substantiate other than providing images. Going back to zomato ♾️
I suggest it's better if swiggy close . because it's of of no use.soon due to unprofessional Behaviour swiggy will loose it's customer base.and share will fall for sure.
Such a disgusting experience had with akkbi customer service. Bad very bad..they put me hold on long time after that they said . sorry for inconvenience. I will never suggest to anyone order with swiggy.
"Swiggy is a disgusting company, very poor service, I placed an order at 8 pm and my order didn't arrive till 11pm. Delivery boy didn't even bother to pick up the phone. I called so many times in cx care still nothing. At last, I cancelled my order. And all restaurants were closed by 11 pm. Then I cooked food at home. A very bad experience with swiggy. Rating should be 0"
"First of all please keep an option of negative stars people are frustrated with these apps,and there service once they reached an established platform of earning money I know wat the company says , in today's scenario if you are unsatisfed then uninstall our app and get lost from us, this is the way the customer care behaves, but when you have grown it was we who praised gave stars and it's because of us you are in this place and it won't be very late to fall with this attitude of business model of making money, we don't say we won't pay but have some basic ethics in life, not always a rich guy orders from this app, reasons are hundreds wat every second person has written in below reviews, so I won't say the same and it's not that you don't have an idea of what's going on I just came here to say WAKE-UP soon before it's too LATE, m uninstalling swiggy(Zero Ethics) from now Good Bye"
"These people are cons 1st make us place the order giving an ETA & after payment increase the ETA, obviously nobody will wait.order # 133600629445 & When asked for refund they need 7 days.In the name of food app these guys are making money by looting people"
"Basically it’s zero or negative rating, I would like to give. Ordered food at 9:00pm and at 10:00 pm delivery partner says he is from rapido and not swiggy. The careless customer service gave me an option for assigning a new delivery partner which would delay the delivery by another 1 hour. If you are incompetent why are you doing this business. Please do shut the business instead of giving fake promises"
Swiggy showing rate more then actual rate of hotels.
"I want to give negative stars. They will cheat customers like anything. Some times money will be debited but order will not get placed, for that Swiggy people will tell we will send ur money back but it takes 4-7 days. If I don’t have money to place order again means I have to starve. While placing order in instamart be careful, they won’t give all the products and they won’t deliver the products by time, there customer service is very bad. Moreover they won’t give any respect for customers feelings"
Sweggy is very bad company pehle to wrong order customer ko dete hain fhir bo order change karane ke bhane  turant usi delivery boy ko return kar dete hain or baad me order cancel karbakar fhir se order karne ko khte hain SWEGGY IS FULLY BAKBAS 👎🏿companyKoi bhi order mat karna  kabhi is company ko
"order no 132676115913 - complete mess up. Money charged and then order cancelled. After lots of efforts , wrong order was sent. No refunds from swiggy. Bunch of cheaters and fraud company. Stay away. Zomato is much better."
"Swiggy does not take any responsibility when wrong/bad quality meat is delivered. Inspite of giving all detailed evidence, they made customer loose money. What's the point in ordering through this portal ? I paid premium price for worst quality delivery. SWIGGY will fall down soon."
"If you use SWIGGY to rder food from any restaurants - you will not be able to complian about the delivery or food. Swiggy DOES NOT care about customer experience. You will almost never get a live person to help - irrespective of the type of experirence you have had. The chat bot chat session will end up with ""we will review your issue and get back to you"" which they never do.The reason is SWIGGY SIMPLY DOES NOT CARE !"
Worst two dairy products were not delivered and an item not ordered was delivered. The delivery person is not responsible and he told me go to my orders and lodge your missing items but there's nothing of that sort. Very unprofessional co partnership. It's half an hour I am trying to figure out how to complaint.Your Swiggy order from Instamart order #1138018120694 was delivered. Keep ordering from Instamart :)
Swiggy instamart service is the worst ones. They charge extra for early delivery and then will never deliver. Everytime you will have to complain and then they will assign a delivery boy.Pathetic service. Just looting people in the name of early delivery.
"Swiggy service is very bad. If you order from one restaurant then they will provide from another restaurant. If you complain about this issue they will say that they are having so called""cloud kitchen"". Also they are not providing restaurant name bill."
"These days swiggy app is the worst, you cannot expect what you ordered,we ordered idly, instead we received dosa, though the bill was showing idly is inside and recently one more bad experience,we ordered a birthday cake,we waited patiently for 3 hours just to find that there was some delivery partner mistake and then I had to talk to 3 customer care executives to get the replacement,worst app ever these days, not at all bothered about customers, they are happy to blame their delivery partner for every mistake and simply say we are sorry,if we order food and if we try to cancel the order after their given time, they are going to charge cancellation fee for us but if it is their mistake,just they will start with sorry and if you are a little more sad they will offer you 51rs coupon for next order, they are not ready to feel from the customers perspective, swiggy should definitely think"
Swiggy is worst app ever i dont even give 1 star to this app i am owner of a restaurent and i have register in swiggy and signed for 25% of deduction but they are deducting 34% and when i tried to contact swiggy  manager of vijayapura he was responding was not good and when i tried to call swiggy customer support even they are not responding us properly worst service i have ever seen and the worst part is the delivery boy sometime doe not come to pick oder as well worst service worst app request u to shut ur office its far more better then providing such services to customer
"Pathetic service from SwiggyOrdered a cake which was damaged while delivered hence requested for replacement, received call from ordering team telling replaced cake will delivered in 45 mins.We waited as they promised deliver as it was more than an hr we check the app and found item was cancelled without any communication. As it was already mid night we were unable get another cake and spoiled our birthday plans waste of time for everyone.When contacted customer care all I got was sorry an offered a compensation of ₹ 100 voucher, I suggest swiggy to have the voucher as a gift from customers end for their worst service."
So swiggy can cancel the after 30mins of placing the order but customer hets only a 1 minute to cancel the order? Should their be corporate responsibility here if you got the order wrong in the first go!
They don't offer refund for orders not delivered by themHow pathetic they are to keep pur money and not deliver our food Thieves

Of late very pathetic experience by Swiggy. It's almost thrice in a span of one month that these people are either not delivering the entire order or deliver something which was not ordered. Inspite of repeated complaints there is no improvement. Yesterday I ordered and received half of my order and the delivery boy says take it or throw in dustbin. This is what you will get. And all amount paid via transfer. Really upset. Friends be careful with Swiggy they are going down and will loot your money
Best app ever used...Thanks for making my day awesome!!
They don't care about what kind of food their clients are getting from past few weeks I order food any hoe some or the other items are missing or sometimes the items itself is not there they don't care if you give remarks they ask you to mail and if you mial them still don't do anything
Worst app..Membership is not worth it.. Restaurant prices are inflated compared to zomato..Customer service is bad.I ordered an iced tea..The restaurant accepted it after 1 and half hr later they say the restaurant is closed.Order number- #129490061689Better go with other food delivery app.Zomato is much better in terms of discount as well customer service.
"Hi we r from hyderabad from kukatpally I ordered gene to deliver some food items and some googles for my daughter to be sent to santosh nagar ,the person named as ashok took the pack from us and didn't deliver to my daughter ,instead was talking rudely and never responded us and vanished .We even ask swiggy they said they are working on this issue and after 8 days they refund the fees of rs 379 charges but my pack with food and googles is yet with the theif hired in swiggy.They are looting people. Staff is stealing the valuables please be carefull ."
Dastagir is a Fraud. Beware of this cheat. He is the worst. They will cancel your prepaid orders and they will not refund your money.
"Delivery guy was unable to find the address and canceled the order and returned.   19 Feb, I made an order (PAID)ORDER NO: 128518937448 I ordered food again and switched off my mobile phone. But, good thing is today he found the address and delivered the food without phone call.   21 Feb Today, I made another order of similar amount. CASH ON DELIVERY. Recovered my loss.ORDER NO: 128518937448"
"Placed order at 9PM. Said order packed, will be delivered by 9.23PM. Initiated chat at 9.30PM, no update. Was transferred 7 times from ""Food Team"" to ""Instamart/Genie Team"", again and again and again, without any explanation. At one point I even asked the sixth guy, ""Would you transfer me again?"" No reply. Few seconds later same prewritten message that I am being transferred. I was on chat for 2 hours. It's very simple, if you don't have the sufficient infrastructure to handle a type of tasks, just don't add it as a feature. Even if you do, if an order doesn't go through or gets failed, it should be updated so a person can seek alternatives."
"I am a vegetarian person, Yesterday I ordered two veg burgers for my kids, when I was not at home, the delivery was delayed which was OK, but later when I reached home, there were four burgers delivered, out of which two were chicken burgers, My son already eat one chicken burger and when realized it was chicken burger he started vomiting, I requested swiggy to log a complaint, however their response was only a feedback will be logged, amount will be refunded and nothing further. I requested if they can send a apology letter, they did not answer, I asked I dont want any compensation , but just want to know if they have a procedure of sending a apology letter, they kept ignoring my question and kept answering automated statements that they apologize and refund is done, this aggravated my situation, I just needed an answer if they have a procedure of sending a apology letter, yes /no/or don't know, however they ignored. I also requested them to send someone and collect the remains as non veg food not of use for us, but they refused. They treated me like a beggar.  I didn't expect any refund or compensation, but an answer to my question, if they are allowed to send an apology letter, yes or no, which was Ignored, the Advisors I had on chat were Mahesh and Chandrima who dealt with the situation badly. Further I dont want  to take any actions, but just leave the issue and not use their services any further. But question remains same, I understand that the mistake might be from the restaurant in packing, however what are we paying Swiggy for if this has to happen. I had no intentions to take this matter further or write a review, but the way I was treated by not answering my question has aggravated me to do this."
"in 1st place prices of food is hiked by 22% to pay the commission to swiggy, delivery charges are quite high ( why charge surcharge charges? just becoz it rains) but service quality is worse1) Delivery service guys have 0 skillsets required for job title.2)  Quality of food most of the time is bad & vendors never follow instructions.3) Swiggy never shares the messages given to drivers.4)delivery charges are very high, most bikes give mileage around 50 to 70 km & cost of petrol is Rs.100 per litre & your rates start from Rs. 26  for 1 km & as high as 80 bucks for 10 to 16 km what a rip-off.  topping that the pay scale starts from Rs. 26,000 plus perks... for a person with 0 skillsets which is an insult for people who have invested in education & in acquiring required skillsets who are paid just Rs.26,000 no perks. Basically, a useless startup that is encouraging people to lose their skills in cooking & encouraging laziness in general."
"Worst service, They don’t deliver, cancel in last minute and loot customer money. 👎"
Unprofessional behaviour of executiveMy order time is about 30 minutes. order got after 45 minutes .they don't even feel sorry for that. awful first experience of instamart
"Swiggy is the worst food delivery service in Jaipur. For the last two times, I ordered on Swiggy at a very famous restaurant and for 45 minutes no any delivery partner was assigned by swiggy and last I had to cancel my order. Also, their chat service is very slow you have to wait for minutes to get one reply. My experience with swiggy is very very very bad."
"Wish I could give zero stars, the delivery guys just took off with my ordered food , would not answer call and the customer support has one solution we will refund , wait actually I asked for refund the customer care did not even offer that he just asked if he should cancel the order … now all restaurants are closed and I am without food…. Thanks swiggy for nothing and making me go hungry tonight…"
I orderd today but delevery boy have no uniform no mask no company's bag. My order butter chicken fully spread.and custumer care says no refund as previously. They call but only says sorry no action. It is tottaly swiggy mistake why d public banned them.
Swiggy is the worst food delivery service in India. Last night I ordered two times and yet no food get delivered. Also their chat service is very slow you have to wait for minutes to get one reply. My experience with swiggy is very very very bad.
Swiggy delivery partner khaana road tak pahuchate hain fir wahi se wapas lejate hain ya khaa jate hai PTA nhi but khana customer tak nhi pahuchta aur fir ye keh ke paise kaate jaate hain ke delivery partner location pe aaya aur call ki aapka call nhi utha to order cancel...
"The reason why I find swiggy to be a horrible service is because they will do nothing if the food is bad or if the restaurant did not give the adequate amount advertised. Even in their app they ask you when you give a restaurant 1 or 2 stars how they can improve, do they actually do something about it? Its a feel heard service where nothing ever happens. Remember Swiggy is always sorry but nothing will ever be done. Once a restaurant canceled my order after 30 mins of me placing it. 30 mins I thought my food was being prepared only to find out after that 30 mins that nope they don't want to make my order. I get a call from a swiggy local office where the lady tells me I have to reorder from another place (this is 30 mins after I have waited). Mind you if I have to order I usually do it b4 prime hours knowing very well that it will be a waiting hell hole if I order at say 1pm or 8pm. I ask her will the restaurant be reprimanded or do will you issue a warning? She says nothing can be done but they are very sorry. The lovely training swiggy gives their employees, where Swiggy is so sorry for your unpleasant experience but nothing will be done what so ever. At this point if I am not at work and in need of food I call the restaurant looking at the menu from swiggy and just ask them if I can come and take the delivery so I don't indirectly pay swiggy the 35% they will take from said restaurant. Like since they won't do anything why should I indirectly help them profit. Every chance I can collect my food without ordering from swiggy is a chance I take. Customers like me are ordering with you cause of necessity not want Swiggy. But its ok, I know you are very sorry and nothing WILL be done."
@swiggy_in swiggy is officially fraud firm to deduct twice transaction from customer account kindly check your bank account if have order any thing from swiggy. They are trying to be innocent to customer to not deliver order on time and then recall to continue your order. Once you reply yes want to continue they charged again.As per legal consumer reports maximum number of complaints are twice deduction from customer bank account. Zomato is quite expensive but the swiggy is much cheaper as per their cheap service. Forward this as much as possible. #fraudswiggy #cheapservice #fakeswiggy

I placed an order with KFC through Swiggy on 31st Dec. 2021. It was cancelled and refund initiated that stated the amount will reflect in my account in 3-4 days, till now it was fine. I was hungry so placed another order with Barbeque Nation amounting approx. Rs 800/-. After 15 min., I received a call from Swiggy representative conveyed that there are more than 50 riders are standing outside restaurant so what to do ? I asked him I can wait for my order. Thenafter 15-20 min as I opened app to check the status of order. I was stunned it was showing that order was cancelled and a message appearing that no amount will be refunded. I LOST MY MONEY AND STAYED HUNGRY ALL NIGHT. Swiggy looting money and while contacted they say to customers that customer cancelled the order and as per policy we have right to take all the money and no food will be delivered. This was my experience with Swiggy. I have screenshot of chat anybody wants it to believe that can be shared.I am writing it for their customers awareness on all social media platforms and thinking to approach consumer court later."
"If there could be any negative rating, that would have been great firstly. I had ordered food through Swiggy from Hotel Virat Belgaum today 28th Dec 2021 at around 9.40pm. Waited for the food for 30 mins as per the time schedule, did not get any calls from delivery Boy (maybe there was some network issue) so I did try connecting the delivery boy but never got connected, hence had to connect with the Swiggy customer support. No new surprises, the support was just awful , they did not provide any other solution but applied 100% cancelation charges along with no food. This is just ridiculous, only making money by keeping the public and little one's hungry starving. Guess what we all with our little 2.5 year old kid had to starve for the night. Another surprising thing, it was told that, the food which got canceled will be given to a needy poor person and that's just fake is we all know. Order number #123784188612"
1. Poor food2. Fack discounts3. Rude and unveted delivery executives4. Hidden charges5. Rude and disrespectful customer service executive. Go & order if you want to loose some brain cells.(like me)
Not at all customer friendly. Worst place to buy food online....
"Due to exigency,sometimes I ordered food from Swiggy.During Covid19 time once I had to refuse the order as the items were unsealed.Again,sometimes I received food,stale,low quality and portion as well,made complaint to customer care only to receive customery answer that feedback will be shared with faulty restaurent!They take no responsibility of bad food served by restaurant!Further,restaurants claim to give 30%,40% discount but that discount is eaten away by the delivery charges...Sometimes customers are made to pay more than MRP actually...Cheating customers in this way! Extremely bad."
"Worst experience. I ordered 2 pizzas from Swiggy on 25thDec. Delivery boy delivered just 1 pizza and ran away before I could see what is inside the cover. I contacted swiggy customer service immediately but the call centre employees were very rude and just offered Rs. 88 as refund against Rs. 677 I paid for 2 pizzas. They were unapologetic and tried covering the mistake. I called nearly 5 times in the span of 20mins as they kept on disconnecting my call after hearing my complaint. I am disappointed with the fraudulent behaviour from the entire staff of Swiggy. I am not too much upset on the money that I lost but upset with he bad and cheap behaviour of the staff including the delivery boy. If some higher official from Swiggy happens to read this review, please advice your staff and pls pay your delivery boys a good salary so that they don't eat customer's food."
"Never use swiggy, I had horrible experience today. Just because I delayed in responding in to the call of the delivery partner by 2 minutes.  He canceled the order and drove away. When I called the customer care they refused to either deliver the food or refund the money. Most horrible experience when you are really hungry."
"The company started well. Then the service was very bad. Thy do not have control over their delivery partner. In one instance delivery partner was under influence of alcohol and picked up item and never came to deliver. In another instance the restaurant partners do not prepare swiggy orders as they are not at all bothered for swiggy orders. swiggy eats up about 23/24% of their sell price. Swiggy customer care can not reach the restaurants not can reach the deliver personnel. The service has gone really down. In This scenario, I believe, I would have really imporoved the standard with drastic measures or would have thought of closing it. Please, think!"
Swiggy is delivering food with no uniform untidy bags even food packs were open very bad experience also not ready to refund saying cannot refund even on sharing all pictures very bad experience Deleting app shame on you Swiggy
"I ordered Swiggy genie to collect birthday cake from Labonel. The item was intact before pickup but damaged in the delivery handling process. Unfortunately Swiggy help was helpless and could only share feedback. They as well stated disclaimer (that’s neither available nor accepted during ordering process), customers are responsible for fragile and high valued food items if they are damaged during delivery process. Ignore the compensation or refund, they didn’t take responsibility or owned for damage caused monetary and emotionally. There was no insurance to consider. There is no assurance by this way and could trust  Swiggy genie any further. I’m extremely disappointed with  spoiled birthday preparations and extremely disappointed with Swiggygenie pushing back the damage caused. If there is a process set, it will be highly appreciated atleast if the responsibility and ownership remains with Swiggygenie rather than stating that it’s customers responsibility while we are ordering. We ordered trusting Swiggygenie but not delivery partner, a complete unknown delivery partner."
"Swiggy Instamart is best skipped, avoid the platform that has no backup, guarantee or customer care from Swiggy. There is invariably a short supply of items already paid for and no space to address grievance. Swiggy will be wise to stick to their core competency of food delivery."
"Swiggy took my money and lied to me. Swiggy promised free delivery if I bought their plan called ""Swiggy Super Binge"". So I bought their ""Swiggy Super Binge"" plan, but now I am paying again for delivery because they decided to not honor the plan I paid for. That is stealing. Swiggy steals money from people."
Rated 1 because of support on Order #121537875767. Order was received after 90 minutes of ordering and all support person did was was replying with pre written templates. Chatting with a bot is more sensible rather than chatting with a person acting like a bot. Switching to Zomato and hoping for better experience there.
Very bad experience with swigy can't believe that they makeing game with food. And customer care services ans only that we don't knowVery bad and no any system to return policy or internal controlPlease don't order by swigy

"Swiggy is a convenient app to order food online and I have to use it often, albeit reluctantly. In the beginning, the customer service was great and I had no complaints. Since 2019, the virtual customer care has almost been replaced by automated messages. I will be sharing a couple of instances where Swiggy's customer care was more like Swiggy's 'company' care. I ordered from Taco Bell through Swiggy and received an entirely different order. I tell them no, I can't eat that. Bear in mind, this was to be my dinner. The virual 'customer care' told me to send proof and email. I did that and all the while I had some chips to sustain myself. At about 2pm or so, I get a reply where they write they couldn't ""validate my claims"". I was stupefied. What do they mean? I write them back and they send the same response. I grow agitated and reach out to their social media team. After a back and forth of about a week, I got my money back. What about my sanity? The time that I lost? No recompense for that.Next, when I found a piece of hair in my food and complained. Same response. I have honestly lost count of the number of times I have had these experiences. Just yesterday, they didn't deliver an item  in my order. Did I receive a refund? No. Do they admit the wrongdoing? The restaurant does while Swiggy remains mum. I am exhausted. India needs BETTER CONSUMER PROTECTION. There are countless claims of wrongdoing by customers and only a handful gets resolved. I can't afford to lose the amount that I spent on a food item that never came to me. It is so disheartening. I hope it gets resolved and a better platform comes up soon so that I can delete Swiggy. So, moral of the story: if you can walk or drive to a restaurant of your choice.. of if you can but don't want to..please don't take the risk of trusting Swiggy."
"I wish there is rating number below 1 I would have given the same. They are a big time fraud. People like us we don’t have any other food apps options then Swiggy and because of that they are talking advantages. Most of the time food is pathetic from the restaurants and customer care executives are having a very standard response to that. I ordered few items from Swiggy genie this morning and paid the exact amount as it’s showing, delivery guy came to my door and made a scene with the bank statement that he didn’t get the amount I paid he got less and asked me to pay the additional. After paying the full amount I had to pay him extra to avoid the scene. I contacted the customer care guy and as usual he was so late and again came up with the standard responses. I wish there are more options instead of Swiggy I would have definitely quit ordering from Swiggy."
"I am writing this review after happened recent one incident with me.I order some food through swiggyBy mistake one previous address has been selected. So I inform the same to swiggy. They connect the call to deliver person where I got to know that the swiggy a big company don't pay delivery people wages on time even if they do extra over time, swiggy company won't pay them. I have call recording also of this matter. At the end the delivery person said swiggy don't pay me so I ll not deliver on other address so they cancel my order and I did not get the food and even I lost the money too. One experience has been done before few days back, the parcel doesn't deliver to me but they show on screen its delivered when I asked where is my parcel they are blaming that we deliver to you, you are lieing.  Such things happened.One more incident that is too worst actually. Due to some order issue I asked help to swiggy chat support, the customer care person using Word 'love' in the chat, I have screenshot of that also.the customer support people are not good. They don't know how to talk with customers. I think swiggy is also earning well after do such cheap thingsThey did not give proper payment to delivery persons who do such good hardwork and they take customer payment benefit like this.Swiggy owner should close it after zomato has been done."
used to work here and god forbid this app and website is really greedy
"I have ordered one cake around 11:30 pm and after 04 hours of delay they have cancelled my order and few minute they have said that order has been delivered. guys do not order on swiggy as this is a worst webiste who can spoil your plans. 0 star service 0 star customer care 000000000000000000000000 star service... shame on you guys do check out your reviews.. people spitting on you every hour sorry every seconds,....."
"See how Swiggy operates. I ordered a mosquito bat from Swiggy. It's battery wasn't working. I complained but Swiggy is just refusing to provide refund or replacement. People, I urge you to learn from this horrible experience and don't order anything from them."
"Worst customer service and poor delivery system. After waiting for more than one hour for food, which was delayed as soon as we placed the order online, the order was cancelled citing that delivery person couldn’t reach you. We didn’t even receive any calls. When we got in touch with customer service immediately, they kept replying with a standard statement that we couldn’t reach you and hence the order is cancelled. We asked them to deliver the order and put us in touch with the driver but they couldn’t care less. To top it up, I was still liable for the order amount that wasn’t even delivered due to their poor delivery system and pathetically managed service. I don’t understand why do they need to rely on calling. There is address on the order, use that to deliver food, just like postal service or courier companies do. At the end, customer service rep agreed to refund 50% of order amount, but when I wrote them an email to complain about the service and deactivate my account, they even retracted on 50% refund and wrote back you are liable for 100% of order amount. And we can’t deactivate your account, just delete the app. This is ridiculous service. Don’t waste your money ordering through them."
"The worst customer service they take lot of time to reply, even after applying the voucher code which is correct their portal says it's not valid, to know what's the problem, they wouldn't even bother to help, the customer service guys spelt Sweegi so I wonder what in world they will provide help. Making money by fooling people."
Worst service support experience if something goes wrong.
The delivery guys says he is being directed to a different address - support says delivery guy is unable to reach you. and while I am chatting with them for the last 60 mins they cancel my order and don't refund my money coz delivery partner could not reach us.I don't understand how their bad mapping and their incompetent delivery people and support are my mistakes. If anything my mistake is choosing swiggy.
"I had ordered food from kritunga restaurant. I clearly known the taste and ingredients of that particular food item. But, i had received a cold, spoiled and yesterday Prepared roadside food with a cover of kritunga restaurant. Immediately I spoken to the swiggy authorities, but they are bargaining with me to deposit some amount in my account. Beware of this type of companies."
"1ST: I WAS CHARGED MORE THAN I OWED...MY BILL WAS 504 I PAID 6042ND: WHEN I RECEIVED MY ORDER, ONE ITEM WAS MISSING AND WHEN I CALLED TO GIVE ME A REFUND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT ITEM IN STOCK-KULFI AND THAT THEY CANNOT REFUND ME!!!!!!!!!!!3RD: BREAD KULCHA WAS BURNT"
"I’ve been using Swiggy for 1year+ but recently I have faced this multiple times, around 4-5 times, orders were worth around 2000 rupees in total I ordered from a restaurant and I called the delivery partner multiple times to check where is the order. however, these guys do not pick up their phones. And when you contact the support they say “Our delivery partner reached you and waited there for 15 mins and we have made calls but we couldn’t reach you. So we decided to cancel and there will be no refund” Note: This happened multiple times with me. So just be careful @everyone with Swiggy"
"The food was awesome, but the person who delivered my food was very rude.. and he doesn't know how to find my location so I think this will be my last order from swiggy."
I don't like giving one start also I have experience such a worst service from them I want to take action on them at any cost I have shared clear picture of leakage of food then also they have not given proper resolution for it daily I do order but one all one problem I face and everytime order will not get on tym and sometimes I order one nd I get one pls someone take action on this and get justice to me pls pathetic experience I'm done so I'm using Zomato app here also noone is taking action on this issue
"After constantly calling and texting and notifying a customer care to be in touch with a customer. Swiggy has yet again failed to deliver a callback after 1 week of follow ups by me (a customer)They say that they are not responsible for the food they deliver. Okay understood but aren't they responsible for the delivery, in general.Food gets late 2 hours and the time they show is 54 min. Still they do not provide me a full refund of this fault. What is Swiggy? An app which takes money from our pocket and fill in their shareholders?Thats it? But they advertise that they are delivery partners. A portal which connects customer to restaurant. Yet they fail to provide any of that."
"Swiggy offer very pathetic service and it’s fraud, I didn’t get my order delivered but still they are saying order has been delivered and they didn’t return money . They are really worst and I don’t have any other words to say about swiggy, such a worst service they offered."
"In my personal experience, this is the best food delivery service available. Even when there is an issue with late delivery or spilled food, they always give me a full refund.The best part is that their delivery staff appears to have been properly trained to avoid annoyance by phone calls and to actually use the GPS. A concept that the zomato guys do not comprehend"
"Horrible experience. Extremely Bad behaviour of swiggy delivery agent , and when complaint swiggy customer online support, they defend their delivery agent and without delivery my food they charged me food cost. Not only that swiggy delivery boy not even delivered food on time took 1 hrs. Where it's shown 20 minutes. And swiggy customer care support horrible.Be aware of Swiggy. Never recommend swiggy especially in Vadodara anyone."
Worst experience from Swiggy use to take money in advance but cancel orders on their own very bad experience
"I ordered a thali from baljeets's Amritsari kulcha on 27th August 2021, using my phone's live location, and the delivery guy got the location wrong, so I asked him to deliver the order on our location which he refused to do and asked us to cancel the order but we didn't cancel the order.After a few minutes the order hot cancelled from the restaurant side only and as penalty they charged us the same amount which we had to pay for the order.I could not write to either swiggy or the restaurant due to some medical issues and now I've been requesting swiggy from past 4-5 days to look into it but they're refusing to help.I had pathetic experience this time."
Hi guys .... Swiggy is very bad app...I order the food..my money also debited...for they taking my order after they cancelled... I'm not getting food...and my money also not getting....I'm asking refound but they not responding....they playing customer money.... it's an big game app....
Poor service. I got my order today after 2.5 hrs whose original ETA was 30 mins . On the top of that the customer service executive Santanu was rude and insensitive despite the utter inconvenience caused by swiggy.
Delivery boy didn't deliver my order and marked it delivered and no one is listening to my concern in Swiggy
best online food delivery website and order deliver on time and best facilities.
"Verybad experience on food ordering.I orderd food via order no112029222316 dt 14/08/2021 at 8.40 pm.Delivery partner didn't pick the call,I tried 20 times resturent did pick up a,I took chat help from your help and I was made to wait for more than 1 hr,they told they have arranngey a different delivery partner,nothinng work out they made me wait,wait wait,I got angry iam a diabetic and aged they put me lot of mental agony and finally they pushed me to cancel the order after 3 hrs,I refused, they made continuous calls sevaral times inspite me telling not to Disturb at that part of the night,they left me  hungry angry and exhausted with mental agony.I will go and file a complaint on consumer court and write worst review on all public platforms.Thank for the worst nightmare I had with swiggy swiggy swiggy."
"Many a times, my order was picked up by the delivery guy, who conveniently ignored to update the system, took the order home and I had to sleep hungry as the restaurants close by 11 PM and Swiggy notified me at 11:35 PM that the order is cancelled.I have been talking to them since 8 days now. No action or any suitable compensation offered by Swiggy."
"If you're reading this, stay AWAY from this app. Use literally any other app - all of them have better customer service AND THEY LET YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT. I was literally told that they have no way to delete my personal information, which we've given permission for them to do whatever the hell they want with in their completely RIDICULOUS terms of service. They're literally telling me to just log out of my account when I WANT THEM TO DELETE IT."
Hai don't use this app because this app I got very bad poor experience happen to me if we have some problems blady no won there to help with us careless answer don't use this application
I have encountered a bitter experience twice where in i was charged but not delivered full fledged order and to further add my complaint was not paid any heed to.  They just dont do anything about your complaints.  And swiggy chat never loads. After this bad experience i uninstalled and unsunscribed to this app and will just not recommend to anybody.  After all its everyone's hard earned money not to be pushed down the drain.
"Dear Swiggy, I wanted to deactivate my account 10 days back, as I received stale food (entire order) from your end. However, you assured me this would not happen again. It so happened that I placed my order for dinner with Chulha Chaukhi Da Dhabha. My order as below:Chicken Lahsunia - 1Phulkha - 6Garlic Naan - 1Kulhad Lassi - 2Chicken Kalmi Kabab - 1The entire order was incorrect. I only received Tandoori Chicken (6 pcs) and Kalmi Kebab (3 psc). I have paid a total amount of 1177/-. Neither did I get the entire reimbursement (as the order was delivered incorrectly from your end), nor did I get a reorder of the same items. I called the customer care, the first executive I spoke to - disconnected my while I insisted that he stays online till issue is resolved. The second executive, pretty much conveyed that I will not get a full reimbursement or a reorder (not in those words exactly).Initially, I had attached pictures of food while they were still in the packet (so that I could at least return it). However, the first executive insisted that I click items of the food from inside the packet. Which I did. However, he said he has no access to chat (your app design or technical issue should not clash with resolution of the issue). Anyway, he pretty much slammed the call on me and went off. That was clearly upsetting. Your chat bots are not highly efficient. They bring out the worst in me. They do not understand the issue at all. I am not sure why my family (diabetic parents) and I had to have food that we did not even place an order for. Moreover, we ended up cooking a meal at home. I even called the delivery guy and requested him to bring back the order, very casually he said, "" call customer care, they will refund.""I have shared all the images with you and despite that you are willing to process just 600/-. I am not sure how that works. How would you feel if your customer took the entire order and paid in cash for part amount. I am sure that is not desirable. The entire experience in July has been frustrating. You are in the food industry, you need to be sensitive to basic need i.e., ""FOOD"". Had I stayed connected with customer care till now, we would go hungry as there is absolutely no care from your end. I placed the order at 7:00 PM, food was delivered at 7:30 PM.. I raised the complaint immediately. Now, it is close to 9:00 PM and I am sitting here writing this I am not sure if I will receive the amount, food or a proper resolution. However, I want to deactivate Swiggy for good. Kindly help me at least delete the account. Best Regards,Sheetal Pawar"
Completely spilled mc donald's food worth 560 and no response.they saidthey will send email.no revert.plus they charge 100 rs charges for food worth 150 within 2 kms
"Ordered 3 food items today from Anjappar restaurant through swiggy. Found the envelop was plain and only the restaurant name printed on the food box. The food quality also was not good. I usually don’t order through online, since I don’t trust after seeing couple looting videos. I thought of give a try today and total disappointment. We as a family ate the food along with kids, and we worry now from where the food was prepared and packed. I ordered the separate item from restaurant through Zomatto and it deliver with proper Anjappar restaurant print on both envelope and food pack."
Very convenient. But customer support is bad. If you get your order great! But if there is a problem resolution is not good. Your best option is to not order from the same place again. Swiggy does not do much to resolve issues.
Extremely bad and unprofessional behaviour....Customer care is totally unreliable and unprofessional.
"Fraudsters! Have been a long standing Swiggy customer and the way they treat you is disgusting. Today I placed an order, paid for the order and was so tired from work that I dozed off. Mobile was away n missed picking the call. They had my complete address, delivery guy didn't even attempt delivery even after paying in full. Is common sense really not common anymore. And they cancelled my order from their end, around 410 rupees was my order value, they robbed me of that entire amount. Imagine my situation, I'm tired else why even order? No food, robbed my money, no empathy, they lack it. And rude & insensitive customer service. Goodbye Swiggy, never again!"
I have order the food order got canceled if I ask for a refund they I’ll say it I’ll take 24 hr to initiate refund after 24hr if I ask of refund they I’ll say there is no active refund for you like that then where is mg order support role is to bad they won’t give any information in help they I’ll say to mail to Swiggy support then who are they replying for me
Angaara Kababs on charcoal- Kondapur--->horrible.i ordered Half Grill chicken. it was totally black. not at all hot.it was cooked atleast 1 week ago.Customer compulsory admitting into hospital & food poisoning.i don't know what is going to happen to me.i ordered from the same restaurant through zomato long time ago.then it was fine.this time from swiggy .i did'nt expect this at all
"Please do not use Swiggy at all, i have used them in many occasions to order from Swiggy for my 5 yr old son as he likes KFC chicken, but everytime i order the order does not reach KFC or it is not processed and end up my son going to bed without his favorite food.I believe KFC is equally responsible for the poor star.I had an awful experience. Rest you are best to decide and review."
When I order a food form swiggy I call to deliver boy and told you have to reach at my building and my building name is so and so ...... So he reply to me that I don't know anything and I will think if I want to come or not it's not. Go to hell ....I don't know why he speaks like this kindly see to it even I have a rec of his .
"The swiggy representative on phone was not ready to speak in Kannada, rather he was looking down on the language. If you are doing business in Karnataka, I expect you to have representatives that respect local language and culture and speak local language.This is completely unacceptable to disrespect local set up."
Very bad service shownI lost my money and my product was not deliveredThe cancellation of order was from their side and I was penalisedThey refused to refundMoreover the delivery guy was very rude and refused to follow instructionsVery bad experience
"My order was automatically cancelled by Swiggy after it was delayed. But delivery person eventually came after a long delay and delivered order and we paid him. He assured that he will notify Swiggy and pay them. But when we tried to order again last week, Swiggy is indicating that we never paid for our order and they will not allow us to order again without paying the amount we already paid the delivery person. I wanted to add this complaint to not get money from Swiggy. But the shady business they are conducting using crooked drivers. They should take responsibility for the actions of their employees."
"I ordered and paid online. Delivery guy called me and i was addressing him the location info, he was pissed of and said ""son of a ...."" I am not gonna deliver the order and updated status as ORDER DELIVERED and haven't received the order and blocked the number. I contacted customer service and asked them to listen to the recording. I am really disappointed with the delivery guy behavior. Customer service people were just sending templates and asking me to wait 24 hours to help me but I know that its not gonna work. He scolded my mom literally and ran away from the location. Customer service was not helpful. I need justice about this incident now. via call and chat with customer service its not gonna work so I  decided to post a review so that anyone would look at this and do the need full. Please help me guys bcoz scolding my mom ... I am unable to digest that word . delivery guy number is 7569769574"
Pathetic service and they misguide u via bots
"Ye aap band hona chaiye...this happen 2 time with me,mai order kar rhi hu for urgent bases and abhi lockdown hai but they still not arrive and they are lying ki abhi ayenge 20 min mcd hai asisa kar rhe the jaise goan se arhe hai and I cancel the order I will never suggest anyone to go with this app..very bad experience 👎🏻 I want my refund amount after getting my refund i will uninstall this app and never ever try this...🤬🤬🤬🤬"
Ridiculous Services by Swiggy!!!! Never going to use there services ever!!! They harass customers after taking money!!!THIRD CLASS SERVICE!!
Everyone it's a request please start giving 1 star to swiggy on play store or app store then maybe they will start taking their customera seriously otherwise they will do the same thing to everyone. Their customer service is pathetic their delivery service is pathetic and after one order they will disable cod option. They will never fulfill your request and never ever resolve your problems thorough customer service. So please🙏 start giving 1 star to swiggy then they might change their policy. #1⭐swiggy
"Now,I don't trust swiggy at all. They are looter being a consecutive customer I order my meal but they said I made a wrong correction .I have showed them all documents still not convinced."
Worst services every time they make excuse of gps n not delivered good somehow I had wasted my 7000 n not suggest anyone to order from them
"Swiggy is a THIEF & FRAUD . BE ALERT !!!They try to keep money with themselves for 7 days and then Invest it in different domains for their benefits. Your order will not get placed but money will be deducted in the name of ""payment failure""........     If the payment has really failed, then, why money has been deducted ?   (Bank Msg has also come)...! Be alert from such Fraudulent APPs ! 👎👎👎"
You are the worst food delivery service provider in India.
very very bad ... food order not done but money debited from account
I had ordered kwality icecream from Swiggy. The price on the pack is Rs 149 and Swiggy is charging Rs 165/-. This has happened before too. We tend not to check and Swiggy merrily cheats. Beware friends.
"Surprised about all the bad reviews here. I've ordered like 300 times from them and their service is excellent 95/100 times. Also, whenever there's a occasional mishap, they make sure they compensate the customer for it."
These people are thugs.I placed an order for food from kfc and paid Rs 2800/-. When the delivery boy came he asked me for OTP which was never sent to me. I received a message that my order was cancelled and an amount of Rs.1394 was deducted. The OTP was never sent to me and this was not my fault.Yet my order was cancelled and Rs.1394/- was deducted.My daughter's birthday was spoilt because of these cheats.
order no. 100015547464This people don’t even deserve a star I had to check my bin to find Kh. Noni Laxmi Devi Swiggy Support Team. Service is so bad that I feel there is no point to contact support team. Looks like this people are in a race to make money. Trustpilot is full of negative reviews. It’s useless and wast of time to contact support team. Stay away with this cheap app called swiggy
I am a senior citizen staying in Himachal Pradesh. Ordered food for someone at Jodhpur from from Himachal. Swiggy accepted the Jodhpur address. It's the first time I ordered food like this. Being novice I could not understand that the GPS location is different on Swiggy site. Swiggy refused to deliver at the given address and charged for full amount of Rs 758/-. I understand they could have charged more for delivery as an appropriate solution but did not. Extremely poor customer care. I will never ever use swiggy in my life. MSG from swiggy- Your Swiggy order #99989553954 has been cancelled. You will be charged Rs 758.0 as cancellation fee.
I have placed my order 3hrs ago in Swiggy app for raw chicken. Till the time I contacted the Customer care noone bothered to reach out and inform me that the order can't be delivered. The funny part is they are only sorry about the horrible service
"HelloI have ordered more than 15+ items from Swiggy! Nothing had been delivered until today. Ordered product value of total items is more than 7000 Rupees. No order, no customer service, nothing is been done. They are taking away the money from Card/other payment methods and telling that the Transaction Failed. This is not Tolerable SWIGGY. If this is continuing, I will have to take more strict actions and necessary steps, to ensure all of my money will be refunded to my original card and payment methods.One of the worst companies I have seen so far. Just send the refund to my payment method.Customer: Vijayashree Bangalore, IN"
"Very poor customer service, charged me for the entire order that was cancelled. I order almost daily and is a very old customer. Me and my whole family uninstalled swiggy."
"Misleading the customer with giving proper information , not responding for the issues . Worst customer service."
Swiggi thinks that their customer have no job but to follow up with them.  I placed order on 27th Saturday:  they called and said item not available I should cancel and place another order which I did.  Now in the system both orders are showing as delivered.  When I contacted them for the refund they are saying it is not possible.  The other issue is:  there is no way you can track the earlier chat with their customer. I think they are taking people for granted terrible service
The timings are bad for because my one order is cancelled due to time and my mom needed to cook food
Stay away from Swiggy app and their worst and pathetic delivery service...they are unprofessional greedy and disgusting .
"This company is just sitting to charge commission, as per them restraunt is solely responsible for food quality. Worst Customer support who can't even tell a wrong order from clear image.All their support team does is to take feedback.. please stop ordering from swiggy and don't waste your money.Suggestion : They should close their customer support team, who anyways do nothing."
Worst experience as they have cancelled my order 5 times in night time after 45 minutes I have ordered and just says couldn't replace order as restraunt is closed they just initiate refund as If I have ordered refund from swiggy and the customer care is there to just inform about refund and they couldn't do anything else over all worst customer care and service.
"Have had a number of issues with swiggy before, but today's episode was a nail in the coffin. I ordered for 8 rotis but was delivered ONLY 1.When I called the customer service, they say that I need to write an email to them and someone would reach out to me in the next 7-8 hours - after which I can have my ""dinner"". Absolutely no way to treat your customers! When someone orders for food, it is expected we receive the correct order/quantity and if we don't, it is swiggy's responsibility to make it right. I was instead simply told that ""someone will respond to your mail in 7-8 hours"" ( no one cares about your dinner ma'am!) . This is the last time I will ever use your horrible services."
Very bad service I ordered a meal from Burger King at 02:13 and it’s 03:06 and order is delayed
"Worst worst and worst service,Didn't deliver food plus donot refund money"
"Worst worst worst worst ever  poor service, spoiled my day. Food did not deliver but showing delivered. What kind if service provider you have. Making fool of people"
"Quality & Delivery to the lowest level... We ordered 4 dishes via Swiggy and 1 dish is not even included in the delivery.  The remaining 3 dishes, 1 dish is not packaged properly and spilled all over the swiggy bag... No food for the family .... Swiggy cancellation is another mess.... 5-7 days as per terms & conditions and if not I will need to chat with call center to get my refund.... Swiggy hopefully you will be able improve service on agent facing, sales.... Absolutely unacceptable and inhumane..."
"They say they care about you and your time. But their actions and policies speak entirely otherwise. For an order that was delayed by 90 mins from the estimated delivery time, they would not let me refund it unless I paid 50% of the total cost as cancellation charge. Mind you the entire delay was because their logistical issues and go nothing to do with me. Then when I seeked help via chat only a bot replied to me for the first 30 minutes, and then the escalation team addressed my issue. Where they basically implied that we understand we have shortcomings which we will solve at your cost. (They didn’t let me cancel the order free of cost)I am someone who places 50+ orders a month easily via the app. But guess it’s time to log off this application, cause if they don’t care for me. They definitely don’t care for someone who orders lesser."
"Very bad application, earlier it was good but now days delivery charge is more. delivery charge is only more than cost of ordered food. should do delivery free. andzomato is better than this application."
Actually a company which is not even worth 1 point. On 28 Jan on email they confirmed refund of 700 in my account within 5-7 working days...and now they have denied that as well. SWIGGY is a CHEATERS....DONT TRUST THEM EVER
"Lethargic service and deceivingI'm one of the loyal customer of Swiggy placed an order id 95152611518 by 12:47pm and around 13:14 received a call from Swiggy and it was conveyed to me that the order was picked by other delivery agent so Swiggy will refund the money.I replied that this is the not the first time it happened to me and Swiggy can check my orders how generous I'm being for the past such incidents. Swiggy mentioned that they can give me a compensation coupon of Rs.25, is this the way Swiggy values it's customer's time and hunger. I would have appreciated if Swiggy might have made another arrangement to ensure the delivery happens instead of such lethargic support service.I escalated to the supervisor but his reply was also not a solution to solve my hunger.All in a sudden I got a notification that the order is delivered this is a deceiving. Is Swiggy making money out if its customer's hunger? What is the justice for the hunger?"
"Very poor service from Swiggy, from delivery person to all live chat person all are fraud , I never accepted this kind of service from Swiggy"
"Warning ⚠️⚠️⚠️                             Everyone Be ALERT !!!!SWIGGY is trying to do a Big & Dangerous "" Fraud "". Today, during payment through my Debit Card, SWIGGY was asking to Access and Auto-type the Bank's OTP from my Phone.Why ????        Bank's OTP is highly concerned with safety and security. How can Swiggy ask for the otp to ?????"
Hi all I am telling everyone not to use thier service I had been suffered twice berore 3 days they have cancelled my order and not refund my amount guys if possible help me out it's not a rupee my 600 rs gone
"The best food delivery service out there in my personal experience. Even when there is a problem occasionally with late delivery or food getting spilled, they give me a full refund. The best part is that their delivery staff seems to be well trained to not annoy the customers with phone calls and actually use the GPS. A concept zomato guys don't understand"
"We ordered from Swiggy and waited for food for three hours and then in the end delivery boy cancelled the order. Then we contacted Swiggy and asked for a refund and they did not even give us the refund. Very very bad customer service and doggy app. I will not recommend ordering from this app. Maybe use Zomato instead,"
"Bakwas Ek dum, I have leave in hostel, from hostel to main gate to reach take time of 15 Min and that time they return my order.Zomato is best than swiggy.And they didn't return my money."
Very bad service paid amount but not recived food
"Decent prices.  Bad delivery rates,  poor customer service. Most restaurants I like are not available. Delivery guys don't even provide door service,  on some of my pre-paid orders they come at a random street and took back my parcel aa I was unable to travel at a place 1km away from your door."
"I Recently ordered my food with Swiggy and they didn't delivered my food , very worst Experience , VERY VERY BAD SERVICE , DONOT USE SWIGGY,,,,,,,,,,........................"
"I have ordered a food yesterday from the swiggy outlet but the delivery boy took 20 minutes to hand over the parcel to me, even after reaching at my place. when i opened it, i saw the packet has already been opened and tasted from the corner. i asked the delivery executive to take it back, as i want to replace but he refused. later i mailed many times, uploaded pictures for proof but no response i get. even i did not get my refund also."
This site & his partner are very big fraud & robber. today purchase rasmalai 10 pcs. & amount 475 R.s. from its site & his partner Name OM Bikaner in Delhi. His partner are cancelled my order. I have not received order & refund Amount.
Their delivery partners yell at the customer and they refuse to do anything about it.The app gives the delivery partner directions only up to the lane behind my house. Then I have to instruct them to come to the next lane where my house is. The partner then has the audacity to yell at me saying that I wrote the wrong address. The Swiggy team refuses to do anything about it.
The Worse app... never ever order in this. totally unprofessional bulls. Worse service in Bangalore
"Food says delivered, No food people waiting.Delivered on Sat, Dec 12, 2020, 02:02 PM"
Very bad Expirance for me.......and this is not 1st time.......i was waiting for my order last 45 min riders told me his bike not working n all but swiggy keep sam backup......you guys always do like this than cutiya bana rahe goo tum......i never order from swiggy.......n i told my friend also please don't order from swiggy.......🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
"Becoming a worst company day by day.Firstly it is not a free service company ( they charge customers and clients ( restaurantsd and stores-for-groceries)And after charging they should have a better customer service.Currently it is pathetic.Do you know there is no way you can speak to a person when you have an issue ?It is all BOT based and you have to answer the BOT questions very smartly to be able to chat with a CSR ( only chat not phone call )And every answer from you the CSR takes 2 mins to answer ( with we understand your pain, we are sorry for the discomfort caused, we will inform the concerned person about this issue etc cookie cutter replies )They charge Rs 40 for delivery of food from restaurants ( and they also charge restaurants a huge percentage ) and now they force you to TIP the delivery person minimum Rs 20 againSo if you are ordering Rs 100 item you will end up paying Rs 160 ( and then NO CUSTOMER SERVICE what so ever )India being an inexpensive country for employment, why are they cutting costs on CSRs ???Why do they force a TIP ?"
"I used swiggy for 3 times, and everytime the service goes to new low. This time was the height, so thought to comment on social media. Pizza delivered in a smashed way. Complained to customer care, but they too were pathetic. They neither replaced the order nor did refund. I will never ever use swiggy henceforth, uninstalled the app now."
"A very bad experience, wherein they take orders and then your money, only to inform you that the items you ordered are not available....the money will be converted to swiggy money (why !!!), or it will take 5 to 7 days for a refund (why!!!). Completely Avoidable. They will keep you hungry."
I don't want to give even 1 star.. As it is mandatory to give to write here.. Pathetic experience I had with swiggy. Worst to worst cancel. Policy.. I ordered from swiggy and there delivery executive after picking up the food from the place and then later says that he will not able to my location.. Swiggy had deducted my money and put up on me everything..
Items was missing from my order(#87974332686).
I have ordered food via swiggy. They accepted my order n paid online. Later on the delivery boy called me and telling that he can't deliver to the address which I have mentioned since it's far somehow wrongly accepted by the app. They charged full amount which I have paid for food(1021rs) as cancellation fee. It's very pathetic service n fraudulent activity. Please do not get service from swiggy. They have no care for customers as well. A customer care guy called me n stated that sorry for the inconvenience n we are charging full amount as cancellation fee or else you should go n pick up the parcel from the hotel location.!! They why they are into this service??? First time witnessing such a fraud service in my entire life.. please don't fall into their prey. Go for other apps for online delivery..
Worst customer service experience ever. Fake discount vouchers.
"Today I had one of the worst experience from any online food app. I order something which should have been delivered in 45 mins, however they took it more than two hours to confirm that it can't be delivered. I got three calls from them, first within 45 mins of ordering the food that delivery executive is having some issue with his bike and they are assigning someone else, then they called me again within half an hour that next executive had also faced similar issue and they are assigning someone else who will deliver it within next 10mins. After that I waited for another 45mins and the call came stating that the order can't be delivered."
"I had ordered chicken fried rice and dal fry. Instead I received a chicken fried rice combo (chilli chicken small serving and half fried rice). I raised this issue with Swiggy customer service, and they offered to raise a new order for the same dish ordered. However, this delivery executive never delivered and my order got cancelled without a refund and I got a bill for full cancellation fee as well. When asked about this, the Swiggy customer service executive said that the delivery executive had waited for a full 24 mins - which was a white washed lie, as I waited outside my main door to see if anyone had approached, for quite sometime. And the customer executive says this: The cancellation fee is imposed to compensate the restaurant and ""asked"" me to be more careful in the future. Yes I'm going to be careful not to order from Swiggy again.. Their policy is themselves and their profit margin first, then the restaurants... The customers can pay and suffer.."
"Most horrible experience with swiggy. they are thieves and they don't even have good customer service. from the food, I ordered I did not receive half of my order. and instead of speaking for me to the restaurant, they tell me that it is not their concern. I'm sorry it is. they should have stood up, and instead of offering total or even half refund, they offered 85 rupees for an 800 rupees order. the worst! spend your hard-earned money on another food delivery service."
Pathetic service in the name of discount doing scam... order different and receive different things
"Worst service, delayed 1& 1/2 hour for delivery than expected time and on top of this I did not get my order which i paid and when I checked with customer care regarding same they have no solution for it...Had chat with their high level managers, it's of no use...  Highly not recommended... Just cheating customers....!"
What is this swiggy ha ? We have ordered chili chicken but you have given us chicken Manchurian. I will give you one star for this silly mistake.
"Absolutely cheating money. They do not deliver prepaid orders, no calls or communications from swiggy and then out of the blue one message comes as your order is cancelled and entire money charged as cancellation fees. They themselves cancel prepaid orders and don't return a penny"
Very bad experience iam order for Motton biryani but came for curry how to eat  really worst experience west app
Could not expect such a behavior from swiggy..the person carrying the order himself took the order he just acted that there was no one at the house creating a story .....I myself saw in camera with a proof I have a photo ......I request you to kindly remove such people from being a member of swiggy...as this only just breaks a trust of people and forcing them to order never in life from now onwards ...and I will give such a feedback on each of your websites as eating someone's food will only curse you and hope to never recieve anything from swiggy .
"I have ordered my food waiting for the delivery person for 45mins. When I try to reach him, his number is not reachable. suddenly I got the message for swiggy that your order has been cancelled and they charged my complete order money as cancellation fee. I reached customer care through chat they are saying that delivery person was trying to reach me. How come when his number is not reachable he was trying to reach.Worst service by swiggy."
"I tried to order a cake for a kid's birthday, the first transaction said failed so I tried again and the second failed as well, the third time it said the transaction was successful . But money was debited for all three times . They delivered the order and it was not opened . So I contacted swiggy for a refund and told them to take the extra orders as well, they refused to give a refund and kept saying as I received the order nothing can be done and I will not receive any refund.DO NOT USE SWIGGY!"
"Third time that the delivery guy has vanished with our food, after we have paid by card and waited over an hour, hungry and tired. Swiggy is the worst app in the history of food delivery, with zero quality control over its delivery boys, abysmal standards of manpower, hiring cheap labour with no verification and absolutely no safeguards or mechanisms of ensuring delivery. They have no shame for this incredible lack of business ethics, not even offering full compensation despite repeated incidents. This is the last time we order from Swiggy, and we will make sure we write this review everywhere possible so others know their story is the same as ours. You should be ashamed of yourselves, please shutdown your business at once!"
"Worst Experience I would saynot the kind of services expected from a big brand like swiggyI ordered food yesterday and It was all stale , it had so much of cream (malai) filled in it which made so much of smell come out if it that it was unbearable to eat , order id  # 82742811408 I raised the issue to the in apl support time at the very moment yesterday , but they didn't provide any help or resolution , I feel all my trust getting faded and compelling me to shift towards other brands like ZOMATO"
"I had the worst experience at Swiggy. I ordered 6 items out of which 2 were missing. The delivery man told me to contact Swiggy executive as he couldn't do anything. I called the Swiggy executive through chat box but he just apologised and mediated that he could give me a coupon of ₹120 (even though I had a loss of ₹230) and I would have to order again.Anyways, I had guests waiting at home and it was a disaster since I had to order again and the food came late again as usual. Not only did I lose my money, my guests had to wait for double the time for the food.Never ordering food from Swiggy again."
"It's really bad day for my order I have not received my full order ,One of the order is missing (checken shawarma )I just chat the customer care person over the swiggy app but no solution provide so far And I have checked with the delivery boy, he told me like (it not my issue, you just check with hotel person so don't order again here) Its not really good to handle customers I am so so so disappointed for this issue,, I hope swiggy is doing good service but now they are doing very bad ..... Over all response is very worst I yet to receiving any call from the respective person so far..I plan to post my comments in over the website and social medias and twitter as well"
"Swiggy is a fraud company and cheating customers like anything, dont order from them, cancel your swiggy account today, they will charge your card and wont deliver food, total fraud company"
"Great app! Allows us to earn a little part time money from viewing videos, follow posts, writing reviews and more. The platform is easy to use and easy to understand."
Vikram Singh is a rude delivery executive.
"Swiggy, the worst site ever I see, the delivery boy was so dirty, talking rubbish, doesn't have manner how to talk with woman, he was so angry mood and he doesn't came to my door step for delivery, he ask me to come to society Maine entrance. I don't want to give single star. But in this after 2 star I can write review. My order number: #78758034363 25 July 7:30Deliver by Z Krunal Panchal"
Worst food delivery partner.One of the worst customer handling team.Always there will be some sort of issue Iin every delivery.
"Never again will i use this app! their refunds take 7 days even if mistake is fully on them.Unpardonable experience this time...i had ordered a birthday cake for a friend living in a different part of the country. After paying and giving the address clearly,even after delivery person reached the correct venue,they cancelled the order with 100%fee, despite instruction from receiving end to leave it with security due to non contact delivery. Fraudulent company! Wouldnt recommend anyone to use!!"
They give you fast delivery and good food esay to order it was awesome app and you can order in web also so i love it
The experience was not good at all as the delivery process takes very much time and the service was not up to the expectation. There is a lot of improvement to be done.
"My daughter ordered 2 Kunafa's from Kunafa World Coles park, bangalore. The order came without the regular sugar syrup. When I called the restaurant they said they sent it. When I called swiggy they didn't care. It is like eating a dosa without chutney or sambar. I told the swiggy customer person about the situation, but they refused to send the syrup. What's the point of half orders"
Very bad service I had place an order 3 products were missing and now they are not ready to refund for the missing items .they are cheating innocent people..rip off
"I have my own review and I am clearly telling you friends never to trust this app. I ordered food from Swiggy last night. I spent an hour but did not assign any delivery executive to my order. In the end, they canceled my order without asking me. I experienced a lot of disappointment with Swiggy."
Ordered veg received non veg n worst part is restaurant is pure non veg. Have raised concern with swiggy but received response as they won't repeat again n till today restaurant in swiggy shows veg . Pathetic service n careless response.Sambit from higher management agree for action but no action taken till today . Not even they returned money also .
Many things are good while ordering food from Swiggy but Cancellation policy does not meet the peoples expectation.
"I used swiggy twice , both times i had bad experience ,Once i ordered food from swiggy it was delivered properly but before we could have food , the delivery guy returned and took back the parcel saying that order was not confirmed .After one year when today i ordered food from INAYAT CAFE through swiggy  it was delivered on time but naan was uncooked and Roti was burnt .When we called inayat cafe and informed concern person , he spoke very arrogantly and said how can someone get Burnt Roti. However I have sent his pictures of burn roti, to which he has not replied yet .However he said you ordered thr swiggy so you can compain them ."
It's an amazing food delivery app.. During this lockdown period they are working sincerely for us.
"I wish there is an option of putting NO STAR for Swiggy. Swiggy took an order today (30-May-20) while checking with the delivery guy, he mentioned he would check how he can reach. Within 1 minute, got a call from Swiggy that order can't be delivered due to place is in the Quarantined area. Further to that Swiggy deducted the Cancellation charge of Rs.30. My first question is why Swiggy took the order in the first place and then cancel it to make money. Order No: 550647323191. I didn't ask Swiggy to take the order, are they not aware which place they can deliver where they can't, being in delivery business. Shame on such Businesses. Don't know how they operate."
"They are processing the orders and after i make payment they said restaurant is closed and will refund me in 4-7 business days. In the time of lockdown people dont have enough money for those kind of mistakes and how i can be sure this dont happen if i make second order. This is like a cyber crime,looting people even at the time pandemic. I dont know anyone reading these feedbacks"
"Restaurant charges are too much, For a single order, I need to pay delivery charge about 50 - 60, restaurant packing charges 20 to 10% of the bill, and then tips."
"I have ordered a meal &&& payment has been done, yet not receive any confirmation from your side... ."
"Please do not order from Swiggy. I order RS 750 and later cancelled and they deducted Rs 374.Swiggy app took wrong address ,I asked to change the address and come to new address but deniedLooks swiggy is doing forgery and looting money from people in covid  situation.I would urge people to take care and not order from swiggy  else they will loot giving any nonsense reason.deliberately the app will pick wrong address and they will do forgery."
"We hv ordered vegetables in swiggy...thy hv mentioned rs.24/kg in display, but when you go for final payment it mentioned for half kg...it's totally confused...we may think about paying for 1kg vegetables for rs.24 but they hv calculated rs.48 for onion...in local shops selling same vegetables RS.24/kg... double the price and no proper response from customer service"
Very very hopelessServed by low quality restaurants and shops.Food will be worst quality you have ever tasted in your life.Very highly priced.Once i was very hungry and i ordered different items from around 3 different restaurants and threw everything into dustbin.
"I ordered and paid money online,but my location was incorrect,there is no option for change the location in this app,only way is to cancel the order.Called customer care, they said there will be a cancellation fee,all of my money deducted.before that i called swiggydelivery boy ,he didnt say anything about the cancellation fee.bad experience!!really disappointe!!"
"There seems to be a scan going on in Swiggy in orders which are paid before, not in orders with COD. The Swiggy delivery boy will be on the way for delivery, suddenly the order will be cancelled by Swiggy, with a plea, the customer didn't respond, the food will not reach you and Swiggy will deduct 70% of your money for non delivery.When you call the delivery boy, talk to customer care, nothing will happen, either you have to sleep without food after paying money to Swiggy.This happens very frequently. Please be very careful."
"My experience on SWIGGY  is very bad, this happened twice to me. paid money online,ordered food, SWIGGY boy picked up the food, on the way, 24 minutes to reach the delivery destination,looking at the mobile and waiting for the food, suddenly another message, your order cancelled by SWIGGY, reason - you are not available to receive the food, the delivery boy called you four times. No call came to my mobile, food didnot reach me. I called the SWIGGY boy to find out what happened, he told, the food is with him, he will bring the food, but didn't turn up. Called SWIGGY help line, customer care, bad response, 70% of my money deducted by SWIGGY. I paid money, waiting for the food,no call from SWIGGY boy, no food reach me and SWIGGY deducted 70% money from me.I found out waht happened, from another SWIGGY boy, what he told me, please read carefully.SWIGGY delivery boy, picked up the food, he didnpt go to the delivery destination, cancelled the order with some reason that the customer at fault, instead he took that food for himself or his friends, or sell that food to other people.When you will  inform Customer care or help line, you will not get good response, as if they are also involved in this planned process.Sent mail to Customer care, alsoto  the Founder of SWIGGY, no good response. This is SWIGGY, please be careful."
"In this covid 19 situation i order yesterday something after saw the terms of swiggy on their wall that how they are taking safety while giving food delivery. But this is only for written, actually they are here only to earn money, how ?Yesterday the delivery boy came without wear gloves, mask, so this is their safety. From now i ll not order anything. I dont have complain against restaurants but these online apps are open not for customer good, its for their income, too much disappointment. And after talk with customer executive about this matter, their reply was, oh so sad, we wil check, after chat with customer executive i can say, they all open only to earn money in this situation also. Too bad thinking. Swiggy. Hats off."
When get fame you increased the price of services and charge a lot of amount to merchants and Customers. This is the reason when we buy fromAny outlet directly they deliver good quality of food but when you buy from swiggy they give poor quality and quantity. Even when we speak with any outlet manager they give same kind of excuse. I would recommend stop using this kind of service provider.
Very bad experience with swiggy many times.  Their chages are very high. They are cheating us. Really don't belive this fraud company.
"It is an Awesome place to order food, but i bought swiggy super and i get only free delivery, they could have arranged something else with it too."
"First the delivery guy calls and says that he is at a different location from my home and I should send him a Google link. So I did. But he says that he is seeing a different location from what I am seeing (from the link that I sent him on his phone). So he says that I will get a call from customer service to resolve the issue. So, while I am chatting with customer service, my order gets cancelled because ""I was unreachable"". Plus I got charged for failed delivery on my next order. #SCAMMERS"
We all should stand together and file and F.I.R against this company coz its not jst the ppl who come to delivery the food but the agents who treat customers like trash over the call. The think they own the company and give us trash over the call. Its been 4 yrs i am using this rubbish app out of no opption. They take ur money and give u deliveryman at ur door who r abusive and arrogant when u dont have 100rs change and when bill is 50rs. I have removed all this print outs chats and even recording of such action and will make sure there is an F.I.R and strick action taken against this company. SWIGGY OUT MONEY IS NOT GROWING ON TREES. WE ALL WORK HARD AND PAY EXTRA 4 THE FOOD ANF THE DELIVERY. U PPL SAY 50% OFF ON UR ORDER BUT THERE NOT LESS THE 15% GETTING CUT SO STOP MAKE UR CUSTOMERS A FOOL COZ THIS TIME I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONES EYES R OPEN. AGAINST UR COMPANY.

"Swiggy is a good app no doubt, but there are times when the order delivery and hotel/restaurant management doesn't work well. I have faced a lot of difficulty, swiggy should do a drive to train all their executives. i would still give them a 4 star because i have been using swiggy for a very long time and have encounterd issues but also have had great services.. so 4 stars is not that bad."
swiggy is really good
"My last 3 orders were all disasters. Twice they served cold food because the delivery agent had multiple orders to deliver. When complained they issued a discount voucher (not a refund) because they want you to order again and get business out of you. And the last order was misleading as they cheated with the incorrect quantity served despite being very particular when ordered. When escalated, they reply with a predefined scripted emails like you are dealing with robots and give you assurance that this will never happen again. The irony is that they don't know how they are going to ensure the error is not repeated again. Wow, what a pathetic service!"
I have always received good service and also gotten refunds whenever needed.
"I ordered a food in swiggy from a restaurant called Homely food which is located in Chennai. I ordered for my parent and they delivered entirely a different food from what I ordered. And then I asked for a replacement, since I can't let my parent to starve. They asked me to pay again for the replacement food. Now when I cancel the replacement food, they charge me half the amount of ordered food as a token of cancellation. Service support provided my Mr. Macwan and Mr. Jaishankar Sharma was not satisfactory and they were rude over call declining to offer a support to the customer. I hereby clearly state that restaurant""Homely food"" is earning money by offering wrong foods (wastage of that day) and swiggy support are damn rude and not supportive to the customers. I strongly recommend not to follow both."
"Bad service and very unprofessional. I first order food from Cafe Corner (Order #57143128810) from the app. First they delay the order and then he canceled i call the guy and I try to argue that they did delivery to my place last week . But the guy keep insisting it must be mistakes and not delivering to my place after so many req ..behaviour is also very rude. I have no time to argue with him, so i just cancelled my order.One Thing i understand was the guy refused my order simply because he is lazy to do delivery. That's why he keep pushing me to use gojek instead and pay extra.Their phone is working, but they just don't want to receive complaining customer. That's why they'll keep ignoring your call.To sum it up, Swiggy Delivery and delivery boys is very lazy and they dont want give service to their customers. Was it worth it to go there for try, personally I don't think so."
"One of the  BAD service in Guwahati ,This is BAD people workingin this organisation, Specially delivary person always late,Asking for extra amount &shouting also ,  If they have to ride or drive few seconds more for delivary.This is BAD PLACE  Guwahati and Assamia Service that is the reason this service is going on no action."
"Very bad experience with Swiggy. ordered food at 9:50Pm and after wait of 1 and half hour it was forcefully canceled from your support team by me for some silly reason that some other picked up the order. And no compensation for customer after 1 and half hour hunger wait. Again reordered and It showed 25min and after completion of 25 min it again says 25 min total 50min again and again shows 30 min so again total 130 min. So Im waiting since 9:50PM and order is going to come at 12:15AM. Later when I called Delivery Executive, he says order will be delivered at 1:00AM. Is this the proper service from swiggy that too 2 times in a row for a delivery distance of 1.5-2 km between restaurant and delivery location and a delivery fee of 40/-. Seriously worst and bulshit is my words and cant say more beeps. Good Bye Swiggy. Thanks for timely dinner to the customer."
Un install the app and teach SWIGGY to grow and prosper mutuallyU tube link Search - Ground Report swiggy delivery executiveTreating employees - delivery guys Unprofessional work culture with ppl who are the roots of the companyPlease support the delivery guys of Faridabad who are on crisis as company announced deduction in per order pay as well as incentives and MGP I still remember the swiggy guy delivering food by 1:30 am in extreme rain and this how the company will gonna take care of the  delivery manDisaster this was my last order through you guys shifting to zomato or Uber good luck swiggy
"Swiggy's drivers are lazy useless bums. They refuse to deliver the items to your door and instead just drop them off with the guards to your house, apartment, whatever, who of course never bother to deliver it to you. Swiggy also will refuse to refund the item. All around, a really crappy company, low quality service, lazy employees, and even lazier customer service help. Just use Big Basket, they have high quality service."
Worst service and the chat agent #qutubuddin he took 20 mins to reply me. the bad customer service agent ever seen
I wish i could give you guys 0 ratings. Why do you take orders when you cant track the oder from dominos? I cant even call them to check my order even after paying the whole amount i m waiting for the order from 2 hours and nobody helped. Very poor customer service
"Charges are too much,For single order I need to pay delivery charge about 30 - 40, hotel packing charge 20 to 10% of bill and then tips."
"I am shocked to know how SWIGGY works based on the recent experience I have had with you.On 16th April, we ordered pizzas (from smokin’ joe’s) a roast chicken pizza and a Napolitana pizza. When the order arrived, we checked the menu again on SWIGGY since the meat and the topping on it seemed inappropriate.Only after confirming it on the SWIGGY menu, I ate the pizza but later found out through my colleague that the other food ordering apps have clearly mentioned that the Napolitana pizza has bacon in it!Every menu on other food ordering apps and even the Smokin’ joe’s menu had clearly mentioned that the pizza comes with a bacon topping but SWIGGY has a menu which states that this specific pizza has roasted chicken and chicken sausage only (Nothing at all about bacon)Now, I hope you guys understand how big this issue is as I ended up eating the pizza with bacon which should have been a chicken pizza just by trusting the menu flashing on SWIGGY!When i tried to confront the SWIGGY team, i got a response on the app that I will get a refund for the pizza!After a while, I called the customer care and spoke with Abdul and then with Shreya and both were sorry for what happened. I was assured by Shreya that SWIGGY will take off the incorrect menu/rectify it within 48 hrs.Again to my surprise, even after a couple of days,  I can still see the same old menu with such a big mistake (Attached screenshot with today’s date) This shows how lightly the team takes this issue and how careless and unprofessional you guys are that even after complaining, no one tried to contact us or rectify the mistake!I have attached the pizza pictures, the screenshot of the menu from 16th April and the screenshot as on today (19th April) for your reference.I hope you guys understand what this means to me because it is for your mistake/carelessness i ended up eating bacon which is strictly against my religious belief!I need a strict action on the team responsible for this and a proper response/explanation to my email so that I can know, how can a big brand like SWIGGY be so careless in the first place and ignore the issue for a couple of days more even after I highlighted it!I am posting this on the social media as well and will eventually write to the consumer court too."
Great experience I started using this app from last 6 months.
